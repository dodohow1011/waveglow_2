LJ001-0001 PRINTING IN THE ONLY SENSE WITH WHICH WE ARE AT PRESENT CONCERNED DIFFERS FROM MOST IF NOT FROM ALL THE ARTS AND CRAFTS REPRESENTED IN THE EXHIBITION
LJ001-0002 IN BEING COMPARATIVELY MODERN
LJ001-0003 FOR ALTHOUGH THE CHINESE TOOK IMPRESSIONS FROM WOOD BLOCKS ENGRAVED IN RELIEF FOR CENTURIES BEFORE THE WOODCUTTERS OF THE NETHERLANDS BY A SIMILAR PROCESS
LJ001-0004 PRODUCED THE BLOCK BOOKS WHICH WERE THE IMMEDIATE PREDECESSORS OF THE TRUE PRINTED BOOK
LJ001-0005 THE INVENTION OF MOVABLE METAL LETTERS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY MAY JUSTLY BE CONSIDERED AS THE INVENTION OF THE ART OF PRINTING
LJ001-0006 AND IT IS WORTH MENTION IN PASSING THAT AS AN EXAMPLE OF FINE TYPOGRAPHY
LJ001-0007 THE EARLIEST BOOK PRINTED WITH MOVABLE TYPES THE GUTENBERG OR FORTYTWO LINE BIBLE OF ABOUT FOURTEEN FIFTY FIVE
LJ001-0008 HAS NEVER BEEN SURPASSED
LJ001-0009 PRINTING THEN FOR OUR PURPOSE MAY BE CONSIDERED AS THE ART OF MAKING BOOKS BY MEANS OF MOVABLE TYPES
LJ001-0010 NOW AS ALL BOOKS NOT PRIMARILY INTENDED AS PICTUREBOOKS CONSIST PRINCIPALLY OF TYPES COMPOSED TO FORM LETTERPRESS
LJ001-0011 IT IS OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE THAT THE LETTER USED SHOULD BE FINE IN FORM
LJ001-0012 ESPECIALLY AS NO MORE TIME IS OCCUPIED OR COST INCURRED IN CASTING SETTING OR PRINTING BEAUTIFUL LETTERS
LJ001-0013 THAN IN THE SAME OPERATIONS WITH UGLY ONES
LJ001-0014 AND IT WAS A MATTER OF COURSE THAT IN THE MIDDLE AGES WHEN THE CRAFTSMEN TOOK CARE THAT BEAUTIFUL FORM SHOULD ALWAYS BE A PART OF THEIR PRODUCTIONS WHATEVER THEY WERE
LJ001-0015 THE FORMS OF PRINTED LETTERS SHOULD BE BEAUTIFUL AND THAT THEIR ARRANGEMENT ON THE PAGE SHOULD BE REASONABLE AND A HELP TO THE SHAPELINESS OF THE LETTERS THEMSELVES
LJ001-0016 THE MIDDLE AGES BROUGHT CALLIGRAPHY TO PERFECTION AND IT WAS NATURAL THEREFORE
LJ001-0017 THAT THE FORMS OF PRINTED LETTERS SHOULD FOLLOW MORE OR LESS CLOSELY THOSE OF THE WRITTEN CHARACTER AND THEY FOLLOWED THEM VERY CLOSELY
LJ001-0018 THE FIRST BOOKS WERE PRINTED IN BLACK LETTER I.E. THE LETTER WHICH WAS A GOTHIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE ANCIENT ROMAN CHARACTER
LJ001-0019 AND WHICH DEVELOPED MORE COMPLETELY AND SATISFACTORILY ON THE SIDE OF THE LOWERCASE THAN THE CAPITAL LETTERS
LJ001-0020 THE LOWERCASE BEING IN FACT INVENTED IN THE EARLY MIDDLE AGES
LJ001-0021 THE EARLIEST BOOK PRINTED WITH MOVABLE TYPE THE AFORESAID GUTENBERG BIBLE IS PRINTED IN LETTERS WHICH ARE AN EXACT IMITATION
LJ001-0022 OF THE MORE FORMAL ECCLESIASTICAL WRITING WHICH OBTAINED AT THAT TIME THIS HAS SINCE BEEN CALLED MISSAL TYPE
LJ001-0023 AND WAS IN FACT THE KIND OF LETTER USED IN THE MANY SPLENDID MISSALS PSALTERS ETC. PRODUCED BY PRINTING IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY
LJ001-0024 BUT THE FIRST BIBLE ACTUALLY DATED WHICH ALSO WAS PRINTED AT MAINTZ BY PETER SCHOEFFER IN THE YEAR FOURTEEN SIXTY TWO
LJ001-0025 IMITATES A MUCH FREER HAND SIMPLER ROUNDER AND LESS SPIKY AND THEREFORE FAR PLEASANTER AND EASIER TO READ
LJ001-0026 ON THE WHOLE THE TYPE OF THIS BOOK MAY BE CONSIDERED THE NEPLUSULTRA OF GOTHIC TYPE
LJ001-0027 ESPECIALLY AS REGARDS THE LOWERCASE LETTERS AND TYPE VERY SIMILAR WAS USED DURING THE NEXT FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS NOT ONLY BY SCHOEFFER
LJ001-0028 BUT BY PRINTERS IN STRASBURG BASLE PARIS LUBECK AND OTHER CITIES
LJ001-0029 BUT THOUGH ON THE WHOLE EXCEPT IN ITALY GOTHIC LETTER WAS MOST OFTEN USED
LJ001-0030 A VERY FEW YEARS SAW THE BIRTH OF ROMAN CHARACTER NOT ONLY IN ITALY BUT IN GERMANY AND FRANCE
LJ001-0031 IN FOURTEEN SIXTY FIVE SWEYNHEIM AND PANNARTZ BEGAN PRINTING IN THE MONASTERY OF SUBIACO NEAR ROME
LJ001-0032 AND USED AN EXCEEDINGLY BEAUTIFUL TYPE WHICH IS INDEED TO LOOK AT A TRANSITION BETWEEN GOTHIC AND ROMAN
LJ001-0033 BUT WHICH MUST CERTAINLY HAVE COME FROM THE STUDY OF THE TWELFTH OR EVEN THE ELEVENTH CENTURY MSS
LJ001-0034 THEY PRINTED VERY FEW BOOKS IN THIS TYPE THREE ONLY BUT IN THEIR VERY FIRST BOOKS IN ROME BEGINNING WITH THE YEAR FOURTEEN SIXTY EIGHT
LJ001-0035 THEY DISCARDED THIS FOR A MORE COMPLETELY ROMAN AND FAR LESS BEAUTIFUL LETTER
LJ001-0036 BUT ABOUT THE SAME YEAR MENTELIN AT STRASBURG BEGAN TO PRINT IN A TYPE WHICH IS DISTINCTLY ROMAN
LJ001-0037 AND THE NEXT YEAR GUNTHER ZEINER AT AUGSBURG FOLLOWED SUIT
LJ001-0038 WHILE IN FOURTEEN SEVENTY AT PARIS UDALRIC GERING AND HIS ASSOCIATES TURNED OUT THE FIRST BOOKS PRINTED IN FRANCE ALSO IN ROMAN CHARACTER
LJ001-0039 THE ROMAN TYPE OF ALL THESE PRINTERS IS SIMILAR IN CHARACTER
LJ001-0040 AND IS VERY SIMPLE AND LEGIBLE AND UNAFFECTEDLY DESIGNED FOR USE BUT IT IS BY NO MEANS WITHOUT BEAUTY
LJ001-0041 IT MUST BE SAID THAT IT IS IN NO WAY LIKE THE TRANSITION TYPE OF SUBIACO
LJ001-0042 AND THOUGH MORE ROMAN THAN THAT YET SCARCELY MORE LIKE THE COMPLETE ROMAN TYPE OF THE EARLIEST PRINTERS OF ROME
LJ001-0043 A FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE ROMAN LETTER TOOK PLACE AT VENICE
LJ001-0044 JOHN OF SPIRES AND HIS BROTHER VINDELIN FOLLOWED BY NICHOLAS JENSON BEGAN TO PRINT IN THAT CITY
LJ001-0045 FOURTEEN SIXTY NINE FOURTEEN SEVENTY
LJ001-0046 THEIR TYPE IS ON THE LINES OF THE GERMAN AND FRENCH RATHER THAN OF THE ROMAN PRINTERS
LJ001-0047 OF JENSON IT MUST BE SAID THAT HE CARRIED THE DEVELOPMENT OF ROMAN TYPE AS FAR AS IT CAN GO
LJ001-0048 HIS LETTER IS ADMIRABLY CLEAR AND REGULAR BUT AT LEAST AS BEAUTIFUL AS ANY OTHER ROMAN TYPE
LJ001-0049 AFTER HIS DEATH IN THE FOURTEEN EIGHTIES OR AT LEAST BY FOURTEEN NINETY PRINTING IN VENICE HAD DECLINED VERY MUCH
LJ001-0050 AND THOUGH THE FAMOUS FAMILY OF ALDUS RESTORED ITS TECHNICAL EXCELLENCE REJECTING BATTERED LETTERS
LJ001-0051 AND PAYING GREAT ATTENTION TO THE PRESS WORK OR ACTUAL PROCESS OF PRINTING
LJ001-0052 YET THEIR TYPE IS ARTISTICALLY ON A MUCH LOWER LEVEL THAN JENSON'S AND IN FACT
LJ001-0053 THEY MUST BE CONSIDERED TO HAVE ENDED THE AGE OF FINE PRINTING IN ITALY
LJ001-0054 JENSON HOWEVER HAD MANY CONTEMPORARIES WHO USED BEAUTIFUL TYPE
LJ001-0055 SOME OF WHICH  AS E.G. THAT OF JACOBUS RUBEUS OR JACQUES LE ROUGE IS SCARCELY DISTINGUISHABLE FROM HIS
LJ001-0056 IT WAS THESE GREAT VENETIAN PRINTERS TOGETHER WITH THEIR BRETHREN OF ROME MILAN
LJ001-0057 PARMA AND ONE OR TWO OTHER CITIES WHO PRODUCED THE SPLENDID EDITIONS OF THE CLASSICS WHICH ARE ONE OF THE GREAT GLORIES OF THE PRINTER'S ART
LJ001-0058 AND ARE WORTHY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE EAGER ENTHUSIASM FOR THE REVIVED LEARNING OF THAT EPOCH BY FAR
LJ001-0059 THE GREATER PART OF THESE ITALIAN PRINTERS IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED WERE GERMANS OR FRENCHMEN WORKING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ITALIAN OPINION AND AIMS
LJ001-0060 IT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD THAT THROUGH THE WHOLE OF THE FIFTEENTH AND THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURIES
LJ001-0061 THE ROMAN LETTER WAS USED SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE GOTHIC
LJ001-0062 EVEN IN ITALY MOST OF THE THEOLOGICAL AND LAW BOOKS WERE PRINTED IN GOTHIC LETTER
LJ001-0063 WHICH WAS GENERALLY MORE FORMALLY GOTHIC THAN THE PRINTING OF THE GERMAN WORKMEN
LJ001-0064 MANY OF WHOSE TYPES INDEED LIKE THAT OF THE SUBIACO WORKS ARE OF A TRANSITIONAL CHARACTER
LJ001-0065 THIS WAS NOTABLY THE CASE WITH THE EARLY WORKS PRINTED AT ULM AND IN A SOMEWHAT LESSER DEGREE AT AUGSBURG
LJ001-0066 IN FACT GUNTHER ZEINER'S FIRST TYPE AFTERWARDS USED BY SCHUSSLER IS REMARKABLY LIKE THE TYPE OF THE BEFOREMENTIONED SUBIACO BOOKS
LJ001-0067 IN THE LOW COUNTRIES AND COLOGNE WHICH WERE VERY FERTILE OF PRINTED BOOKS GOTHIC WAS THE FAVORITE
LJ001-0068 THE CHARACTERISTIC DUTCH TYPE AS REPRESENTED BY THE EXCELLENT PRINTER GERARD LEEW IS VERY PRONOUNCED AND UNCOMPROMISING GOTHIC
LJ001-0069 THIS TYPE WAS INTRODUCED INTO ENGLAND BY WYNKYN DE WORDE CAXTON'S SUCCESSOR
LJ001-0070 AND WAS USED THERE WITH VERY LITTLE VARIATION ALL THROUGH THE SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH CENTURIES AND INDEED INTO THE EIGHTEENTH
LJ001-0071 MOST OF CAXTON'S OWN TYPES ARE OF AN EARLIER CHARACTER THOUGH THEY ALSO MUCH RESEMBLE FLEMISH OR COLOGNE LETTER
LJ001-0072 AFTER THE END OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY THE DEGRADATION OF PRINTING ESPECIALLY IN GERMANY AND ITALY
LJ001-0073 WENT ON APACE AND BY THE END OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY THERE WAS NO REALLY BEAUTIFUL PRINTING DONE
LJ001-0074 THE BEST MOSTLY FRENCH OR LOWCOUNTRY WAS NEAT AND CLEAR BUT WITHOUT ANY DISTINCTION
LJ001-0075 THE WORST WHICH PERHAPS WAS THE ENGLISH WAS A TERRIBLE FALLINGOFF FROM THE WORK OF THE EARLIER PRESSES
LJ001-0076 AND THINGS GOT WORSE AND WORSE THROUGH THE WHOLE OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY SO THAT IN THE EIGHTEENTH PRINTING WAS VERY MISERABLY PERFORMED
LJ001-0077 IN ENGLAND ABOUT THIS TIME AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE NOTABLY BY CASLON WHO STARTED BUSINESS IN LONDON AS A TYPEFOUNDER IN SEVENTEEN TWENTY
LJ001-0078 TO IMPROVE THE LETTER IN FORM
LJ001-0079 CASLON'S TYPE IS CLEAR AND NEAT AND FAIRLY WELL DESIGNED
LJ001-0080 HE SEEMS TO HAVE TAKEN THE LETTER OF THE ELZEVIRS OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY FOR HIS MODEL
LJ001-0081 TYPE CAST FROM HIS MATRICES IS STILL IN EVERYDAY USE
LJ001-0082 IN SPITE HOWEVER OF HIS PRAISEWORTHY EFFORTS PRINTING HAD STILL ONE LAST DEGRADATION TO UNDERGO
LJ001-0083 THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY FOUNTS WERE BAD RATHER NEGATIVELY THAN POSITIVELY
LJ001-0084 BUT FOR THE BEAUTY OF THE EARLIER WORK THEY MIGHT HAVE SEEMED TOLERABLE
LJ001-0085 IT WAS RESERVED FOR THE FOUNDERS OF THE LATER EIGHTEENTH CENTURY TO PRODUCE LETTERS WHICH ARE POSITIVELY UGLY AND WHICH IT MAY BE ADDED
LJ001-0086 ARE DAZZLING AND UNPLEASANT TO THE EYE OWING TO THE CLUMSY THICKENING AND VULGAR THINNING OF THE LINES
LJ001-0087 FOR THE SEVENTEENTHCENTURY LETTERS ARE AT LEAST PURE AND SIMPLE IN LINE. THE ITALIAN BODONI AND THE FRENCHMAN DIDOT
LJ001-0088 WERE THE LEADERS IN THIS LUCKLESS CHANGE THOUGH OUR OWN BASKERVILLE WHO WAS AT WORK SOME YEARS BEFORE THEM WENT MUCH ON THE SAME LINES
LJ001-0089 BUT HIS LETTERS THOUGH UNINTERESTING AND POOR ARE NOT NEARLY SO GROSS AND VULGAR AS THOSE OF EITHER THE ITALIAN OR THE FRENCHMAN
LJ001-0090 WITH THIS CHANGE THE ART OF PRINTING TOUCHED BOTTOM
LJ001-0091 SO FAR AS FINE PRINTING IS CONCERNED THOUGH PAPER DID NOT GET TO ITS WORST TILL ABOUT EIGHTEEN FORTY
LJ001-0092 THE CHISWICK PRESS IN EIGHTEEN FORTY FOUR REVIVED CASLON'S FOUNTS PRINTING FOR MESSRS. LONGMAN THE DIARY OF LADY WILLOUGHBY
LJ001-0093 THIS EXPERIMENT WAS SO FAR SUCCESSFUL THAT ABOUT EIGHTEEN FIFTY MESSRS. MILLER AND RICHARD OF EDINBURGH
LJ001-0094 WERE INDUCED TO CUT PUNCHES FOR A SERIES OF OLD STYLE LETTERS
LJ001-0095 THESE AND SIMILAR FOUNTS CAST BY THE ABOVE FIRM AND OTHERS
LJ001-0096 HAVE NOW COME INTO GENERAL USE AND ARE OBVIOUSLY A GREAT IMPROVEMENT ON THE ORDINARY MODERN STYLE IN USE IN ENGLAND WHICH IS IN FACT THE BODONI TYPE
LJ001-0097 A LITTLE REDUCED IN UGLINESS. THE DESIGN OF THE LETTERS OF THIS MODERN OLD STYLE LEAVES A GOOD DEAL TO BE DESIRED
LJ001-0098 AND THE WHOLE EFFECT IS A LITTLE TOO GRAY OWING TO THE THINNESS OF THE LETTERS
LJ001-0099 IT MUST BE REMEMBERED HOWEVER THAT MOST MODERN PRINTING IS DONE BY MACHINERY ON SOFT PAPER AND NOT BY THE HAND PRESS
LJ001-0100 AND THESE SOMEWHAT WIRY LETTERS ARE SUITABLE FOR THE MACHINE PROCESS WHICH WOULD NOT DO JUSTICE TO LETTERS OF MORE GENEROUS DESIGN
LJ001-0101 IT IS DISCOURAGING TO NOTE THAT THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE LAST FIFTY YEARS IS ALMOST WHOLLY CONFINED TO GREAT BRITAIN
LJ001-0102 HERE AND THERE A BOOK IS PRINTED IN FRANCE OR GERMANY WITH SOME PRETENSION TO GOOD TASTE
LJ001-0103 BUT THE GENERAL REVIVAL OF THE OLD FORMS HAS MADE NO WAY IN THOSE COUNTRIES
LJ001-0104 ITALY IS CONTENTEDLY STAGNANT
LJ001-0105 AMERICA HAS PRODUCED A GOOD MANY SHOWY BOOKS THE TYPOGRAPHY PAPER AND ILLUSTRATIONS OF WHICH ARE HOWEVER ALL WRONG
LJ001-0106 ODDITY RATHER THAN RATIONAL BEAUTY AND MEANING BEING APPARENTLY THE THING SOUGHT FOR BOTH IN THE LETTERS AND THE ILLUSTRATIONS
LJ001-0107 TO SAY A FEW WORDS ON THE PRINCIPLES OF DESIGN IN TYPOGRAPHY
LJ001-0108 IT IS OBVIOUS THAT LEGIBILITY IS THE FIRST THING TO BE AIMED AT IN THE FORMS OF THE LETTERS
LJ001-0109 THIS IS BEST FURTHERED BY THE AVOIDANCE OF IRRATIONAL SWELLINGS AND SPIKY PROJECTIONS AND BY THE USING OF CAREFUL PURITY OF LINE
LJ001-0110 EVEN THE CASLON TYPE WHEN ENLARGED SHOWS GREAT SHORTCOMINGS IN THIS RESPECT
LJ001-0111 THE ENDS OF MANY OF THE LETTERS SUCH AS THE T AND E ARE HOOKED UP IN A VULGAR AND MEANINGLESS WAY
LJ001-0112 INSTEAD OF ENDING IN THE SHARP AND CLEAR STROKE OF JENSON'S LETTERS
LJ001-0113 THERE IS A GROSSNESS IN THE UPPER FINISHINGS OF LETTERS LIKE THE C THE A AND SO ON
LJ001-0114 AN UGLY PEARSHAPED SWELLING DEFACING THE FORM OF THE LETTER
LJ001-0115 IN SHORT IT HAPPENS TO THIS CRAFT AS TO OTHERS THAT THE UTILITARIAN PRACTICE THOUGH IT PROFESSES TO AVOID ORNAMENT
LJ001-0116 STILL CLINGS TO A FOOLISH BECAUSE MISUNDERSTOOD CONVENTIONALITY DEDUCED FROM WHAT WAS ONCE ORNAMENT AND IS BY NO MEANS USEFUL
LJ001-0117 WHICH TITLE CAN ONLY BE CLAIMED BY ARTISTIC PRACTICE WHETHER THE ART IN IT BE CONSCIOUS OR UNCONSCIOUS
LJ001-0118 IN NO CHARACTERS IS THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE UGLY AND VULGAR ILLEGIBILITY OF THE MODERN TYPE
LJ001-0119 AND THE ELEGANCE AND LEGIBILITY OF THE ANCIENT MORE STRIKING THAN IN THE ARABIC NUMERALS
LJ001-0120 IN THE OLD PRINT EACH FIGURE HAS ITS DEFINITE INDIVIDUALITY AND ONE CANNOT BE MISTAKEN FOR THE OTHER
LJ001-0121 IN READING THE MODERN FIGURES THE EYES MUST BE STRAINED BEFORE THE READER CAN HAVE ANY REASONABLE ASSURANCE
LJ001-0122 THAT HE HAS A FIVE AN EIGHT OR A TJREE BEFORE HIM UNLESS THE PRESS WORK IS OF THE BEST
LJ001-0123 THIS IS AWKWARD IF YOU HAVE TO READ BRADSHAW'S GUIDE IN A HURRY
LJ001-0124 ONE OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINE TYPE AND THE UTILITARIAN MUST PROBABLY BE PUT DOWN TO A MISAPPREHENSION OF A COMMERCIAL NECESSITY
LJ001-0125 THIS IS THE NARROWING OF THE MODERN LETTERS
LJ001-0126 MOST OF JENSON'S LETTERS ARE DESIGNED WITHIN A SQUARE
LJ001-0127 THE MODERN LETTERS ARE NARROWED BY A THIRD OR THEREABOUT BUT WHILE THIS GAIN OF SPACE VERY MUCH HAMPERS THE POSSIBILITY OF BEAUTY OF DESIGN
LJ001-0128 IT IS NOT A REAL GAIN FOR THE MODERN PRINTER THROWS THE GAIN AWAY BY PUTTING INORDINATELY WIDE SPACES BETWEEN HIS LINES WHICH PROBABLY
LJ001-0129 THE LATERAL COMPRESSION OF HIS LETTERS RENDERS NECESSARY
LJ001-0130 COMMERCIALISM AGAIN COMPELS THE USE OF TYPE TOO SMALL IN SIZE TO BE COMFORTABLE READING
LJ001-0131 THE SIZE KNOWN AS LONG PRIMER OUGHT TO BE THE SMALLEST SIZE USED IN A BOOK MEANT TO BE READ
LJ001-0132 HERE AGAIN IF THE PRACTICE OF LEADING WERE RETRENCHED LARGER TYPE COULD BE USED WITHOUT ENHANCING THE PRICE OF A BOOK
LJ001-0133 ONE VERY IMPORTANT MATTER IN SETTING UP FOR FINE PRINTING IS THE SPACING THAT IS THE LATERAL DISTANCE OF WORDS FROM ONE ANOTHER
LJ001-0134 IN GOOD PRINTING THE SPACES BETWEEN THE WORDS SHOULD BE AS NEAR AS POSSIBLE EQUAL
LJ001-0135 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THEY SHOULD BE QUITE EQUAL EXCEPT IN LINES OF POETRY
LJ001-0136 MODERN PRINTERS UNDERSTAND THIS BUT IT IS ONLY PRACTICED IN THE VERY BEST ESTABLISHMENTS
LJ001-0137 BUT ANOTHER POINT WHICH THEY SHOULD ATTEND TO THEY ALMOST ALWAYS DISREGARD
LJ001-0138 THIS IS THE TENDENCY TO THE FORMATION OF UGLY MEANDERING WHITE LINES OR RIVERS IN THE PAGE
LJ001-0139 A BLEMISH WHICH CAN BE NEARLY THOUGH NOT WHOLLY AVOIDED BY CARE AND FORETHOUGHT
LJ001-0140 THE DESIRABLE THING BEING THE BREAKING OF THE LINE AS IN BONDING MASONRY OR BRICKWORK
LJ001-0141 THE GENERAL SOLIDITY OF A PAGE IS MUCH TO BE SOUGHT FOR
LJ001-0142 MODERN PRINTERS GENERALLY OVERDO THE WHITES IN THE SPACING A DEFECT PROBABLY FORCED ON THEM BY THE CHARACTERLESS QUALITY OF THE LETTERS
LJ001-0143 FOR WHERE THESE ARE BOLDLY AND CAREFULLY DESIGNED AND EACH LETTER IS THOROUGHLY INDIVIDUAL IN FORM
LJ001-0144 THE WORDS MAY BE SET MUCH CLOSER TOGETHER WITHOUT LOSS OF CLEARNESS
LJ001-0145 NO DEFINITE RULES HOWEVER EXCEPT THE AVOIDANCE OF RIVERS AND EXCESS OF WHITE CAN BE GIVEN FOR THE SPACING
LJ001-0146 WHICH REQUIRES THE CONSTANT EXERCISE OF JUDGMENT AND TASTE ON THE PART OF THE PRINTER
LJ001-0147 THE POSITION OF THE PAGE ON THE PAPER SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IF THE BOOK IS TO HAVE A SATISFACTORY LOOK
LJ001-0148 HERE ONCE MORE THE ALMOST INVARIABLE MODERN PRACTICE IS IN OPPOSITION TO A NATURAL SENSE OF PROPORTION
LJ001-0149 FROM THE TIME WHEN BOOKS FIRST TOOK THEIR PRESENT SHAPE TILL THE END OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY OR INDEED LATER
LJ001-0150 THE PAGE SO LAY ON THE PAPER THAT THERE WAS MORE SPACE ALLOWED TO THE BOTTOM AND FORE MARGIN THAN TO THE TOP AND BACK OF THE PAPER
LJ001-0151 THE UNIT OF THE BOOK BEING LOOKED ON AS THE TWO PAGES FORMING AN OPENING
LJ001-0152 THE MODERN PRINTER IN THE TEETH OF THE EVIDENCE GIVEN BY HIS OWN EYES CONSIDERS THE SINGLE PAGE AS THE UNIT AND PRINTS THE PAGE IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS PAPER
LJ001-0153 ONLY NOMINALLY SO HOWEVER IN MANY CASES SINCE WHEN HE USES A HEADLINE HE COUNTS THAT IN
LJ001-0154 THE RESULT AS MEASURED BY THE EYE BEING THAT THE LOWER MARGIN IS LESS THAN THE TOP ONE AND THAT THE WHOLE OPENING HAS AN UPSIDEDOWN LOOK VERTICALLY
LJ001-0155 AND THAT LATERALLY THE PAGE LOOKS AS IF IT WERE BEING DRIVEN OFF THE PAPER
LJ001-0156 THE PAPER ON WHICH THE PRINTING IS TO BE DONE IS A NECESSARY PART OF OUR SUBJECT
LJ001-0157 OF THIS IT MAY BE SAID THAT THOUGH THERE IS SOME GOOD PAPER MADE NOW
LJ001-0158 IT IS NEVER USED EXCEPT FOR VERY EXPENSIVE BOOKS ALTHOUGH IT WOULD NOT MATERIALLY INCREASE THE COST IN ALL BUT THE VERY CHEAPEST
LJ001-0159 THE PAPER THAT IS USED FOR ORDINARY BOOKS IS EXCEEDINGLY BAD EVEN IN THIS COUNTRY BUT IS BEATEN IN THE RACE FOR VILENESS
LJ001-0160 BY THAT MADE IN AMERICA WHICH IS THE WORST CONCEIVABLE
LJ001-0161 THERE SEEMS TO BE NO REASON WHY ORDINARY PAPER SHOULD NOT BE BETTER MADE
LJ001-0162 EVEN ALLOWING THE NECESSITY FOR A VERY LOW PRICE BUT ANY IMPROVEMENT MUST BE BASED ON SHOWING OPENLY THAT THE CHEAP ARTICLE IS CHEAP
LJ001-0163 E.G. THE CHEAP PAPER SHOULD NOT SACRIFICE TOUGHNESS AND DURABILITY TO A SMOOTH AND WHITE SURFACE
LJ001-0164 WHICH SHOULD BE INDICATIONS OF A DELICACY OF MATERIAL AND MANUFACTURE WHICH WOULD OF NECESSITY INCREASE ITS COST
LJ001-0165 ONE FRUITFUL SOURCE OF BADNESS IN PAPER
LJ001-0166 IS THE HABIT THAT PUBLISHERS HAVE OF EKING OUT A THIN VOLUME BY PRINTING IT ON THICK PAPER ALMOST OF THE SUBSTANCE OF CARDBOARD
LJ001-0167 A DEVICE WHICH DECEIVES NOBODY AND MAKES A BOOK VERY UNPLEASANT TO READ
LJ001-0168 ON THE WHOLE A SMALL BOOK SHOULD BE PRINTED ON PAPER WHICH IS AS THIN AS MAY BE WITHOUT BEING TRANSPARENT
LJ001-0169 THE PAPER USED FOR PRINTING THE SMALL HIGHLY ORNAMENTED FRENCH SERVICEBOOKS ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY IS A MODEL IN THIS RESPECT
LJ001-0170 BEING THIN TOUGH AND OPAQUE
LJ001-0171 HOWEVER THE FACT MUST NOT BE BLINKED THAT MACHINEMADE PAPER CANNOT IN THE NATURE OF THINGS BE MADE OF SO GOOD A TEXTURE AS THAT MADE BY HAND
LJ001-0172 THE ORNAMENTATION OF PRINTED BOOKS IS TOO WIDE A SUBJECT TO BE DEALT WITH FULLY HERE BUT ONE THING MUST BE SAID ON IT
LJ001-0173 THE ESSENTIAL POINT TO BE REMEMBERED IS THAT THE ORNAMENT WHATEVER IT IS WHETHER PICTURE OR PATTERNWORK SHOULD FORM PART OF THE PAGE
LJ001-0174 SHOULD BE A PART OF THE WHOLE SCHEME OF THE BOOK
LJ001-0175 SIMPLE AS THIS PROPOSITION IS IT IS NECESSARY TO BE STATED
LJ001-0176 BECAUSE THE MODERN PRACTICE IS TO DISREGARD THE RELATION BETWEEN THE PRINTING AND THE ORNAMENT ALTOGETHER
LJ001-0177 SO THAT IF THE TWO ARE HELPFUL TO ONE ANOTHER IT IS A MERE MATTER OF ACCIDENT
LJ001-0178 THE DUE RELATION OF LETTER TO PICTURES AND OTHER ORNAMENT WAS THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD BY THE OLD PRINTERS SO THAT
LJ001-0179 EVEN WHEN THE WOODCUTS ARE VERY RUDE INDEED
LJ001-0180 THE PROPORTIONS OF THE PAGE STILL GIVE PLEASURE BY THE SENSE OF RICHNESS THAT THE CUTS AND LETTER TOGETHER CONVEY
LJ001-0181 WHEN AS IS MOST OFTEN THE CASE THERE IS ACTUAL BEAUTY IN THE CUTS
LJ001-0182 THE BOOKS SO ORNAMENTED ARE AMONGST THE MOST DELIGHTFUL WORKS OF ART THAT HAVE EVER BEEN PRODUCED
LJ001-0183 THEREFORE GRANTED WELLDESIGNED TYPE DUE SPACING OF THE LINES AND WORDS AND PROPER POSITION OF THE PAGE ON THE PAPER
LJ001-0184 ALL BOOKS MIGHT BE AT LEAST COMELY AND WELLLOOKING AND IF TO THESE GOOD QUALITIES WERE ADDED REALLY BEAUTIFUL ORNAMENT AND PICTURES
LJ001-0185 PRINTED BOOKS MIGHT ONCE AGAIN ILLUSTRATE TO THE FULL
LJ001-0186 THE POSITION OF OUR SOCIETY THAT A WORK OF UTILITY MIGHT BE ALSO A WORK OF ART IF WE CARED TO MAKE IT SO
LJ002-0001 THE CHRONICLES OF NEWGATE VOLUME TWO BY ARTHUR GRIFFITHS SECTION FOUR NEWGATE DOWN TO EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN
LJ002-0002 UNDER THE CONDITIONS REFERRED TO IN THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER
LJ002-0003 WITH CRIMINALS AND MISDEMEANANTS OF ALL SHADES CROWDING PERPETUALLY INTO ITS NARROW LIMITS THE LATTER STATE OF NEWGATE WAS WORSE THAN THE FIRST
LJ002-0004 THE NEW JAIL FELL AS FAR SHORT OF THE DEMANDS MADE ON IT AS DID THE OLD
LJ002-0005 THE PRISON POPULATION FLUCTUATED A GREAT DEAL
LJ002-0006 BUT IT WAS ALMOST ALWAYS IN EXCESS OF THE ACCOMMODATION AVAILABLE AND THERE WERE TIMES WHEN THE PLACE WAS FULL TO OVERFLOWING
LJ002-0007 NEILD GIVES SOME FIGURES WHICH WELL ILLUSTRATE THIS
LJ002-0008 ON THE 14TH JUNE 1800 THERE WERE 199 DEBTORS AND 289 FELONS IN THE PRISON
LJ002-0009 ON THE 27TH APRIL IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR
LJ002-0010 THESE NUMBERS HAD RISEN TO 275 AND 375 RESPECTIVELY OR 650 IN ALL
LJ002-0011 FOR TWO MORE YEARS THESE HIGH FIGURES WERE STEADILY MAINTAINED AND IN 1803 THE TOTAL ROSE TO 710
LJ002-0012 AFTER THAT THEY FELL AS STEADILY
LJ002-0013 TILL 1808 THE LOWEST POINT WAS TOUCHED OF 197 DEBTORS AND 182 FELONS OR 379 IN ALL
LJ002-0014 THE NUMBERS SOON INCREASED HOWEVER AND BY 1811 HAD AGAIN RISEN TO 629 AND MR. NEILD WAS TOLD THAT THERE HAD BEEN AT ONE TIME
LJ002-0015 300 DEBTORS AND 900 CRIMINALS IN NEWGATE OR TWELVE HUNDRED PRISONERS IN ALL
LJ002-0016 PREVIOUS TO THAT DATE THERE HAD BEEN 700 OR 800 FREQUENTLY AND ONCE IN MR. AKERMAN'S TIME ONE THOUSAND
LJ002-0017 TRUSTWORTHY EVIDENCE IS FORTHCOMING TO THE EFFECT THAT THESE HIGH FIGURES WERE CONSTANTLY MAINTAINED FOR MANY MONTHS AT A TIME
LJ002-0018 THE INADEQUACY OF THE JAIL WAS NOTICED AND REPORTED UPON AGAIN AND AGAIN BY THE GRAND JURIES OF THE CITY OF LONDON
LJ002-0019 WHO SELDOM LET A SESSION GO BY WITHOUT VISITING NEWGATE
LJ002-0020 IN 1813
LJ002-0021 THE GRAND JURY MADE A SPECIAL PRESENTMENT TO THE COURT OF COMMON COUNCIL POINTING OUT THAT ON THE DEBTORS' SIDE WHICH WAS INTENDED FOR ONLY 100
LJ002-0022 NO LESS THAN 340 WERE CROWDED TO THE GREAT INCONVENIENCE AND DANGER OF THE INMATES
LJ002-0023 ON THE FEMALE SIDE MATTERS WERE MUCH WORSE
LJ002-0024 QUOTE. THE APARTMENTS SET APART FOR THEM BEING BUILT TO ACCOMMODATE 60 PERSONS NOW CONTAIN ABOUT 120. END QUOTE
LJ002-0025 RETURNS LAID BEFORE THE HOUSE OF COMMONS SHOWED THAT 6439 PERSONS HAD BEEN COMMITTED TO NEWGATE
LJ002-0026 IN THE THREE YEARS BETWEEN 1813 AND 1816
LJ002-0027 AND THIS NUMBER DID NOT INCLUDE THE DEBTORS A NUMEROUS CLASS WHO WERE STILL COMMITTED TO NEWGATE PENDING THE COMPLETION OF THE WHITE CROSS STREET PRISON
LJ002-0028 IN ORDER TO REALIZE THE EVILS ENTAILED BY INCARCERATION IN NEWGATE IN THESE DAYS IT IS NECESSARY TO GIVE SOME ACCOUNT OF ITS INTERIOR
LJ002-0029 AS IT WAS OCCUPIED AND APPROPRIATED IN 1810
LJ002-0030 FULL DETAILS OF THE ARRANGEMENTS ARE TO BE FOUND IN MR. NEILD'S STATE OF PRISONS IN ENGLAND SCOTLAND AND WALES PUBLISHED IN EIGHTEEN TWELVE
LJ002-0031 THE JAIL AT THAT DATE WAS DIVIDED INTO EIGHT SEPARATE AND MORE OR LESS DISTINCT DEPARTMENTS EACH OF WHICH HAD ITS OWN WARDS AND YARD
LJ002-0032 THESE WERE ONE THE MALE DEBTORS' SIDE
LJ002-0033 TWO THE FEMALE DEBTORS' SIDE THREE THE CHAPEL YARD FOUR THE MIDDLE YARD
LJ002-0034 FIVE THE MASTER FELONS' SIDE SIX THE FEMALE FELONS' SIDE SEVEN THE STATE SIDE
LJ002-0035 EIGHT THE PRESS YARD
LJ002-0036 ONE THE MALE DEBTORS' SIDE CONSISTED OF A YARD FORTYNINE FEET BY THIRTYONE
LJ002-0037 LEADING TO THIRTEEN WARDS ON VARIOUS FLOORS AND A DAY ROOM
LJ002-0038 OF THESE WARDS THREE WERE APPROPRIATED TO THE CABIN SIDE SO CALLED BECAUSE
LJ002-0039 THEY EACH CONTAINED FOUR SMALL ROOMS OR CABINS SEVEN FEET SQUARE
LJ002-0040 INTENDED TO ACCOMMODATE A COUPLE OF PRISONERS APIECE BUT OFTEN MUCH MORE CROWDED
LJ002-0041 TWO OTHER WARDS WERE APPROPRIATED TO THE MASTER'S SIDE DEBTORS THEY WERE EACH TWENTYTHREE FEET BY FOURTEEN AND A HALF
LJ002-0042 AND SUPPOSED TO ACCOMMODATE TWENTY PERSONS. THE EIGHT REMAINING WARDS WERE FOR THE COMMON SIDE DEBTORS
LJ002-0043 LONG NARROW ROOMS  ONE THIRTYSIX FEET SIX TWENTYTHREE FEET AND THE EIGHTH EIGHTEEN
LJ002-0044 THE WHOLE ABOUT FIFTEEN FEET WIDE
LJ002-0045 THE VARIOUS WARDS WERE ALL ABOUT ELEVEN FEET IN HEIGHT
LJ002-0046 AND WERE OCCUPIED AS A RULE BY TEN TO FIFTEEN PEOPLE WHEN THE PRISON WAS NOT CROWDED BUT DOUBLE THE NUMBER WAS OCCASIONALLY PLACED IN THEM
LJ002-0047 THE DAY ROOM WAS FITTED WITH BENCHES AND SETTLES AFTER THE MANNER OF THE TAP IN A PUBLICHOUSE
LJ002-0048 TWO THE FEMALE DEBTORS' SIDE CONSISTED OF A COURTYARD FORTYNINE BY SIXTEEN FEET
LJ002-0049 LEADING TO TWO WARDS ONE OF WHICH WAS THIRTYSIX FEET BY FIFTEEN
LJ002-0050 AND THE OTHER EIGHTEEN BY FIFTEEN AND THEY NOMINALLY HELD TWENTYTWO PERSONS
LJ002-0051 A HIGH WALL FIFTEEN FEET IN HEIGHT DIVIDED THE FEMALES' COURTYARD FROM THE MEN'S
LJ002-0052 THREE THE CHAPEL YARD WAS ABOUT FORTYTHREE FEET BY TWENTYFIVE
LJ002-0053 IT HAD BEEN FOR SOME TIME DEVOTED PRINCIPALLY TO FELONS OF THE WORST TYPES
LJ002-0054 THOSE WHO WERE THE OLDEST OFFENDERS SENTENCED TO TRANSPORTATION AND WHO HAD NARROWLY ESCAPED THE PENALTY OF DEATH
LJ002-0055 THIS ARRANGEMENT WAS HOWEVER MODIFIED AFTER 1811 AND THE CHAPEL YARD WAS ALLOTTED TO MISDEMEANANTS AND PRISONERS AWAITING TRIAL
LJ002-0056 THE WARDS IN THIS PART WERE FIVE IN NUMBER ALL IN DIMENSIONS TWENTY FEET BY FIFTEEN WITH A SIXTH WARD FIFTEEN FEET SQUARE
LJ002-0057 THESE WARDS WERE ALL FITTED WITH BARRACKBEDS BUT NO BEDDING WAS SUPPLIED
LJ002-0058 THE CHAPEL YARD LED TO THE CHAPEL AND ON THE STAIRCASE WERE TWO ROOMS FREQUENTLY SET APART FOR THE KING'S WITNESSES
LJ002-0059 THOSE WHO HAD TURNED KING'S EVIDENCE WHOSE SAFETY MIGHT HAVE BEEN IMPERILED HAD THEY BEEN LODGED WITH THE MEN AGAINST WHOM THEY HAD INFORMED
LJ002-0060 BUT THESE KING'S WITNESSES WERE ALSO PUT AT TIMES INTO THE PRESS YARD AMONG THE CAPITAL CONVICTS SEEMINGLY A VERY DANGEROUS PROCEEDING
LJ002-0061 OR THEY LODGED WITH THE GATESMEN THE PRISONER OFFICERS WHO HAD CHARGE OF THE INNER GATES
LJ002-0062 THE MIDDLE YARD WAS AT FIRST GIVEN UP TO THE LEAST HEINOUS OFFENDERS AFTER EIGHTEEN TWELVE IT CHANGED FUNCTIONS WITH THE CHAPEL YARD
LJ002-0063 IT WAS FIFTY FEET BY TWENTYFIVE AND HAD FIVE WARDS EACH THIRTYEIGHT BY FIFTEEN AT ONE END OF THE YARD WAS AN ARCADE
LJ002-0064 DIRECTLY UNDER THE CHAPEL IN WHICH THERE WERE THREE CELLS USED EITHER FOR THE CONFINEMENT OF DISORDERLY AND REFRACTORY PRISONERS
LJ002-0065 OR FEMALE CONVICTS ORDERED FOR EXECUTION
LJ002-0066 THE MASTER FELONS' SIDE CONSISTED OF A YARD THE SAME SIZE AS THE PRECEDING APPROPRIATED NOMINALLY TO THE MOST DECENT AND BETTERBEHAVED PRISONERS
LJ002-0067 BUT REALLY KEPT FOR THE FEW WHO HAD FUNDS SUFFICIENT TO GAIN THEM ADMISSION TO THESE MORE COMFORTABLE QUARTERS
LJ002-0068 HERE WERE ALSO LODGED THE GATESMEN THE PRISONERS WHO HAD CHARGE OF THE INNER GATES AND WHO WERE ENTRUSTED WITH THE DUTY OF ESCORTING VISITORS FROM THE GATES
LJ002-0069 TO THE VARIOUS WARDS THEIR FRIENDS OCCUPIED
LJ002-0070 THE STATE SIDE WAS THE PART STOLEN FROM THE FEMALE FELONS' SIDE
LJ002-0071 IT WAS LARGE AND COMPARATIVELY COMMODIOUS BEING MAINTAINED ON A BETTER FOOTING THAN ANY OTHER PART OF THE PRISON
LJ002-0072 THE INMATES WERE PRIVILEGED EITHER BY ANTECEDENTS OR THE FORTUNATE POSSESSION OF SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO PAY THE CHARGES OF THE PLACE
LJ002-0073 NEILD TAKES IT FOR GRANTED THAT THE FORMER RATHER THAN THE LATTER PREVAILED IN THE SELECTION
LJ002-0074 AND TELLS US THAT IN THE STATE SIDE QUOTE SUCH PRISONERS WERE SAFELY ASSOCIATED WHOSE MANNERS AND CONDUCT EVINCE A MORE LIBERAL STYLE OF EDUCATION
LJ002-0075 AND WHO ARE THEREFORE LODGED APART FROM ALL OTHER DISTRICTS OF THE JAIL END QUOTE
LJ002-0076 THE STATE SIDE CONTAINED TWELVE GOODSIZED ROOMS
LJ002-0077 FROM TWENTYONE BY EIGHTEEN FEET TO FIFTEEN FEET SQUARE WHICH WERE FURNISHED WITH BEDSTEADS AND BEDDING
LJ002-0078 SEVEN THE PRESS YARD WAS THAT PART SET ASIDE FOR THE CONDEMNED
LJ002-0079 ITS NAME AND ITS SITUATION WERE THE SAME AS THOSE OF THE OLD PLACE OF CARRYING OUT THE TERRIBLE SENTENCE INFLICTED ON ACCUSED PERSONS WHO STOOD MUTE
LJ002-0080 THE LONG NARROW YARD STILL REMAINED AS WE SAW IT IN JACOBITE TIMES
LJ002-0081 AND BEYOND IT WAS NOW A DAY ROOM FOR THE CAPITAL CONVICTS OR THOSE AWAITING EXECUTION
LJ002-0082 BEYOND THE PRESS YARD WERE THREE STORIES CONDEMNED CELLS FIFTEEN IN ALL WITH VAULTED CEILINGS NINE FEET HIGH TO THE CROWN OF THE ARCH
LJ002-0083 THE GROUND FLOOR CELLS WERE NINE FEET BY SIX
LJ002-0084 THOSE ON THE FIRST FLOOR WERE RATHER LARGER ON ACCOUNT OF A SETOFF IN THE WALL AND THE UPPERMOST WERE THE LARGEST FOR THE SAME REASON
LJ002-0085 SECURITY WAS PROVIDED FOR IN THESE CONDEMNED CELLS BY LINING THE SUBSTANTIAL STONE WALLS WITH PLANKS STUDDED WITH BROADHEADED NAILS
LJ002-0086 THEY WERE LIGHTED BY A DOUBLEGRATED WINDOW TWO FEET NINE INCHES BY FOURTEEN INCHES AND IN THE DOORS WHICH WERE FOUR INCHES THICK
LJ002-0087 A CIRCULAR APERTURE HAD BEEN LET IN TO GIVE VENTILATION AND SECURE A FREE CURRENT OF AIR
LJ002-0088 IN EACH CELL THERE WAS A BARRACK BEDSTEAD ON THE FLOOR WITHOUT BEDDING
LJ002-0089 8. THE FEMALE FELONS WERE DEPRIVED OF PART OF THE SPACE WHICH THE ARCHITECT HAD INTENDED FOR THEM
LJ002-0090 MORE THAN HALF THEIR QUADRANGLE HAD BEEN PARTITIONED OFF FOR ANOTHER PURPOSE
LJ002-0091 AND WHAT REMAINED WAS DIVIDED INTO A MASTER'S AND A COMMON SIDE FOR FEMALE FELONS
LJ002-0092 THE TWO YARDS WERE ADJOINING THAT FOR THE COMMON SIDE MUCH THE LARGEST
LJ002-0093 THERE WERE NINE WARDS IN ALL ON THE FEMALE SIDE ONE OF THEM IN THE ATTIC
LJ002-0094 WITH FOUR CASEMENTS AND TWO FIREPLACES BEING ALLOTTED FOR A FEMALE INFIRMARY
LJ002-0095 AND THE REST BEING PROVIDED WITH BARRACK BEDS AND IN DIMENSIONS VARYING FROM THIRTY FEET BY FIFTEEN TO FIFTEEN FEET BY TEN
LJ002-0096 THE EIGHT COURTS ABOVE ENUMERATED WERE WELL SUPPLIED WITH WATER
LJ002-0097 THEY HAD DUSTBINS SEWERS AND SO FORTH PROPERLY DISPOSED AND THE CITY SCAVENGER PAID PERIODICAL VISITS TO THE PRISON
LJ002-0098 THE PRISONERS HAD FEW COMFORTS BEYOND THE OCCASIONAL USE OF A BATH AT SOME DISTANCE SITUATED IN THE PRESS YARD
LJ002-0099 TO WHICH ACCESS WAS GRANTED RARELY AND AS A GREAT FAVOR BUT THEY WERE ALLOWED THE LUXURY OF DRINK  IF THEY COULD PAY FOR IT
LJ002-0100 A RECENT REFORM HAD CLOSED THE TAP KEPT BY THE JAILER WITHIN THE PRECINCTS BUT
LJ002-0101 THERE WAS STILL A CONVENIENT ROOM WHICH SERVED AND QUOTE
LJ002-0102 NEAR IT A GRATING THROUGH WHICH THE DEBTORS RECEIVE THEIR BEER FROM THE NEIGHBORING PUBLICHOUSES
LJ002-0103 THE FELONS' SIDE HAS A SIMILAR ACCOMMODATION AND THIS MODE OF INTRODUCING THE BEVERAGE IS ADOPTED BECAUSE NO PUBLICAN AS SUCH
LJ002-0104 CAN BE PERMITTED TO ENTER THE INTERIOR OF THIS PRISON. END QUOTE. THE TAPROOM AND BAR WERE JUST BEHIND THE FELONS' ENTRANCE LODGE
LJ002-0105 AND BEYOND IT WAS A ROOM CALLED THE WINE ROOM BECAUSE FORMERLY USED FOR THE SALE OF WINE BUT
LJ002-0106 IN WHICH LATTERLY A COPPER HAD BEEN FIXED FOR THE COOKING OF PROVISIONS SENT IN BY CHARITABLE PERSONS
LJ002-0107 QUOTE ON THE TOP OF THE JAIL CONTINUES NEILD ARE A WATCHHOUSE AND A SENTRYBOX WHERE TWO OR MORE GUARDS WITH DOGS AND FIREARMS
LJ002-0108 WATCH ALL NIGHT. ADJOINING THE FELONS' SIDE LODGE IS THE KEEPER'S OFFICE WHERE THE PRISON BOOKS ARE KEPT AND HIS CLERK
LJ002-0109 CALLED THE CLERK OF THE PAPERS ATTENDS DAILY END QUOTE
LJ002-0110 HAVING THUS BRIEFLY DESCRIBED THE PLAN AND APPROPRIATION OF THE PRISON I PROPOSE TO DEAL NOW WITH THE GENERAL CONDITION OF THE INMATES AND THE MANNER OF THEIR LIFE
LJ002-0111 OF THESE THE DEBTORS MALE AND FEMALE FORMED A LARGE PROPORTION
LJ002-0112 THE FREQUENCY AND EXTENT OF PROCESSES AGAINST DEBTORS SEVENTY OR EIGHTY YEARS AGO WILL APPEAR ALMOST INCREDIBLE
LJ002-0113 IN AN AGE WHEN INSOLVENT ACTS AND BANKRUPTCY COURTS DO SO MUCH TO RELIEVE THE IMPECUNIOUS
LJ002-0114 AND IMPRISONMENT FOR DEBT HAS ALMOST ENTIRELY DISAPPEARED
LJ002-0116 THE NUMBER OF PROCESSES AGAINST DEBTORS ANNUALLY WAS EXTRAORDINARY
LJ002-0117 NEILD GIVES ON THE AUTHORITY OF MR. BURCHELL THE UNDER SHERIFF OF MIDDLESEX
LJ002-0118 A TABLE SHOWING THE FIGURES FOR THE YEAR ENDING MICHAELMAS 1802
LJ002-0119 IN THAT PERIOD UPWARDS OF 200000 WRITS
LJ002-0120 HAD BEEN ISSUED FOR THE ARRESTS OF DEBTORS IN THE KINGDOM FOR SUMS VARYING FROM FOURPENCE TO £500 AND UPWARDS
LJ002-0121 FIFTEEN THOUSAND OF THESE WERE ISSUED IN MIDDLESEX ALONE WHICH AT THAT TIME WAS RECKONED AS ONLY A FIFTEENTH OF GREAT BRITAIN
LJ002-0122 THE NUMBER OF ARRESTS ACTUALLY MADE WAS 114300 FOR THE KINGDOM AND 7020 FOR MIDDLESEX
LJ002-0123 BARELY HALF OF THESE GAVE BAIL BONDS ON ARRESTS AND THE REMAINDER WENT TO PRISON
LJ002-0124 QUITE HALF OF THE FOREGOING WRITS AND ARRESTS APPLIED TO SUMS UNDER THIRTY POUNDS
LJ002-0125 NEILD ALSO SAYS THAT IN SEVENTEEN NINETY THREE
LJ002-0126 5719 WRITS AND EXECUTIONS FOR DEBTS BETWEEN £10 AND £20 WERE ISSUED IN MIDDLESEX
LJ002-0127 AND THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF DEBTS SUED FOR WAS £81791
LJ002-0128 HE ALSO MAKES THE CURIOUS CALCULATION THAT THE COSTS OF THESE ACTIONS IF UNDEFENDED
LJ002-0129 WOULD HAVE AMOUNTED TO £68728 AND IF DEFENDED
LJ002-0130 £285950 IN OTHER WORDS THAT TO RECOVER EIGHTY ODD THOUSAND POUNDS
LJ002-0131 THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT WOULD BE EXPENDED
LJ002-0132 AN ELABORATE MACHINERY PLANNED FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE TRADER AND ALTOGETHER ON HIS SIDE HAD LONG EXISTED FOR THE RECOVERY OF DEBTS
LJ002-0133 ALFRED THE GREAT ESTABLISHED THE COURT BARON THE HUNDRED COURT AND THE COUNTY COURT WHICH AMONG OTHER MATTERS ENTERTAINED PLEAS FOR DEBT
LJ002-0134 THE COUNTY COURT WAS THE SHERIFF'S WHO SAT THERE SURROUNDED BY THE BISHOP AND THE MAGNATES OF THE COUNTY
LJ002-0135 BUT AS TIME PASSED DIFFICULTIES AND DELAYS IN OBTAINING JUDGMENT LED TO THE REMOVAL OF CAUSES TO THE GREAT COURT OF KING'S BENCH
LJ002-0136 AND THE DISUSE OF THE INFERIOR COURTS
LJ002-0137 SO MUCH INCONVENIENCE ENSUED THAT IN FIFTEEN EIGHTEEN THE CORPORATION OBTAINED FROM PARLIAMENT AN ACT EMPOWERING TWO ALDERMEN
LJ002-0138 AND FOUR COMMON COUNCILMEN TO HOLD COURTS OF REQUESTS OR COURTS OF CONSCIENCE TO HEAR AND DETERMINE ALL CAUSES OF DEBT
LJ002-0139 UNDER 40 SHILLINGS ARISING WITHIN THE CITY
LJ002-0140 THESE COURTS WERE EXTENDED TWO CENTURIES LATER TO SEVERAL LARGE PROVINCIAL TOWNS AND ALL WERE IN FULL ACTIVITY WHEN NEILD WROTE
LJ002-0141 AND INDEED SUPPLIED THE BULK OF THE POOR DEBTORS COMMITTED TO PRISON
LJ002-0142 THESE COURTS WERE OPEN TO MANY AND GRAVE OBJECTIONS
LJ002-0143 THE COMMISSIONERS WHO PRESIDED WERE QUOTE LITTLE OTHERWISE THAN SELFELECTED
LJ002-0144 AND WHEN ONCE APPOINTED CONTINUED TO SERVE SINE DIE THEY WERE GENERALLY NEAR IN RANK TO THE PARTIES WHOSE CAUSES THEY DECIDED
LJ002-0145 OFTEN A COMMISSIONER HAD TO LEAVE THE BENCH BECAUSE HE WAS HIMSELF A PARTY TO THE SUIT THAT WAS SUB JUDICE
LJ002-0146 THE ACTIVITY AS WELL AS THE FUTILITY OF THESE COURTS MAY BE ESTIMATED FROM THE STATEMENT GIVEN BY NEILD
LJ002-0147 THAT THIRTEEN HUNDRED AND TWELVE DEBTORS WERE COMMITTED BY THEM TO NEWGATE BETWEEN 1797 AND 1808
LJ002-0148 AND THAT NO MORE THAN 197 CREDITORS RECOVERED DEBTS AND COSTS
LJ002-0149 THE LATTER INDEED HUNG LIKE MILLSTONES ROUND THE NECK OF THE UNHAPPY INSOLVENT WRETCHES WHO FOUND THEMSELVES IN LIMBO
LJ002-0150 COSTS WERE THE GALLONS OF SACK TO THE PENNYWORTH OF DEBT
LJ002-0151 NEILD FOUND AT HIS VISIT TO NEWGATE IN 1810
LJ002-0152 FOURTEEN MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAD LAIN THERE TEN ELEVEN AND THIRTEEN YEARS FOR DEBTS OF A FEW SHILLINGS
LJ002-0153 WEIGHTED BY TREBLE THE AMOUNT OF COSTS
LJ002-0154 THUS AMONGST OTHERS THOMAS BLACKBURN HAD BEEN COMMITTED ON OCTOBER 15TH FOR A DEBT OF 1 SHILLING 5 PENCE
LJ002-0155 FOR WHICH THE COSTS WERE 6 SHILLINGS 10 PENCE
LJ002-0156 THOMAS DOBSON ON 22ND AUGUST 1799 FOR 1 SHILLING WITH COSTS OF 8 SHILLINGS 10 PENCE
LJ002-0157 AND SUSANNAH EVANS IN OCTOBER THE SAME YEAR FOR 2 SHILLINGS WITH COSTS OF 6 SHILLINGS 8 PENCE
LJ002-0158 OTHER CASES ARE RECORDED ELSEWHERE AS AT THE GILTSPUR STREET COMPTER WHERE IN 1805 MR. NEILD FOUND A MAN NAMED WILLIAM GRANT
LJ002-0159 DETAINED FOR 1 SHILLING 9 PENCE WITH COSTS OF 5 SHILLINGS
LJ002-0160 AND JOHN LANCASTER FOR 1 SHILLING 8 PENCE WITH COSTS OF 7 SHILLINGS 6 PENCE. QUOTE
LJ002-0161 THESE SURELY I THOUGHT SAYS MR. NEILD WERE BAD ENOUGH BUT IT WAS NOT SO. END QUOTE
LJ002-0162 HE RECITES ANOTHER MOST OUTRAGEOUS AND EXTRAORDINARY CASE IN WHICH ONE JOHN BIRD
LJ002-0163 A MARKET PORTER WAS ARRESTED AND COMMITTED AT THE SUIT OF A PUBLICAN
LJ002-0164 FOR THE PALTRY SUM OF 4 PENCE WITH COSTS OF 7 SHILLINGS 6 PENCE
LJ002-0165 BIRD WAS HOWEVER DISCHARGED WITHIN THREE DAYS BY A SUBSCRIPTION RAISED AMONG HIS FELLOWPRISONERS
LJ002-0166 MR. BUXTON IN HIS INQUIRY INTO THE SYSTEM OF PRISON DISCIPLINE
LJ002-0167 QUOTES A CASE WHICH CAME WITHIN HIS OWN KNOWLEDGE OF A BOY SENT TO PRISON FOR NONPAYMENT OF ONE PENNY
LJ002-0168 THE LAD IN QUESTION WAS FOUND IN COLDBATH FIELDS PRISON TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN SENT FOR A MONTH IN DEFAULT OF PAYING A FINE OF FORTY SHILLINGS
LJ002-0169 HE HAD BEEN IN THE EMPLOY OF A CORNCHANDLER AT ISLINGTON AND WENT INTO LONDON WITH HIS MASTER'S CART AND HORSE
LJ002-0170 THERE WAS IN THE CITY ROAD A TEMPORARY BAR WITH A COLLECTOR OF TOLLS WHO WAS SOMETIMES ON THE SPOT AND SOMETIMES NOT
LJ002-0171 THE BOY DECLARED HE SAW NO ONE AND ACCORDINGLY PASSED THROUGH WITHOUT PAYING THE TOLL OF A PENNY
LJ002-0172 FOR THIS HE WAS SUMMONED BEFORE A MAGISTRATE AND SENTENCED AS ALREADY STATED
LJ002-0173 THE LAD WAS PROVED TO BE OF GOOD CHARACTER AND THE SON OF RESPECTABLE PARENTS
LJ002-0174 MR. BUXTON'S FRIENDS AT ONCE PAID THE FORTY SHILLINGS AND THE BOY WAS RELEASED
LJ002-0175 THE COSTS IN HEAVIER DEBTS ALWAYS DOUBLED THE SUM IF THE ARREST WAS MADE IN THE COUNTRY IT TREBLED IT
LJ002-0176 NEILD GIVES A LIST OF THE VARIOUS ITEMS CHARGED UPON A DEBT OF £10 WHICH INCLUDED INSTRUCTIONS TO SUE
LJ002-0177 AFFIDAVIT OF DEBT DRAWING PRAECIPE 1 POUND 5 SHILLINGS CAPIAS FEE TO OFFICER ON ARREST
LJ002-0178 AFFIDAVIT OF SERVICE AND MANY MORE AMOUNTING IN ALL TO TWENTYSEVEN
LJ002-0179 AND COSTING 11 POUNDS 15 SHILLINGS 8 PENCE WITHIN TEN DAYS
LJ002-0180 BEFORE DEALING WITH THE DEBTORS IN NEWGATE I MAY REFER INCIDENTALLY
LJ002-0181 TO THOSE IN OTHER LONDON PRISONS FOR NEWGATE WAS NOT THE ONLY PLACE OF DURANCE FOR THESE UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE. THERE WERE ALSO THE KING'S BENCH
LJ002-0182 THE FLEET AND THE MARSHALSEA PRISONS ESPECIALLY DEVOTED TO THEM
LJ002-0183 WHILST LUDGATE THE GILTSPUR STREET AND BOROUGH COMPTERS ALSO RECEIVED THEM
LJ002-0184 THE LATTER TWO BEING ALSO A PRISON FOR FELONS AND VAGRANTS ARRESTED WITHIN CERTAIN LIMITS
LJ002-0185 THE KING'S BENCH WAS A NATIONAL PRISON IN WHICH WERE CONFINED ALL DEBTORS ARRESTED FOR DEBT OR FOR CONTEMPT OF THE COURT OF THE KING'S BENCH
LJ002-0186 THE POPULATION GENERALLY AMOUNTED TO FROM FIVE HUNDRED TO SEVEN HUNDRED THE ACCOMMODATION BEING CALCULATED FOR TWO HUNDRED
LJ002-0187 EVERY NEWCOMER WAS ENTITLED TO A CHUMMAGE TICKET BUT DID NOT ALWAYS GET IT
LJ002-0188 BEING OFTEN OBLIGED TO PAY A HIGH RENT FOR A BED AT THE COFFEEHOUSE OR IN SOME ROOM WHICH WAS VACATED BY ITS REGULAR OCCUPANT
LJ002-0189 NO FIXED RATES OR RULES GOVERNED THE HIRING OUT OF ROOMS OR PARTS OF A ROOM AND ALL SORTS OF IMPOSITION WAS PRACTICED
LJ002-0190 THE BEST OR AT LEAST THE MOST INFLUENTIAL PRISONERS GOT LODGING IN THE STATE HOUSE WHICH CONTAINED EIGHT LARGE HANDSOME ROOMS
LJ002-0191 BESIDES THOSE ACTUALLY RESIDENT WITHIN THE WALLS
LJ002-0192 ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED MORE OR LESS TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE RULES AND LIVED OUTSIDE WITHIN A CIRCUMFERENCE OF TWO MILES AND A HALF
LJ002-0193 IN THESE CASES SECURITY WAS GIVEN FOR THE AMOUNT OF THE DEBT
LJ002-0194 AND A HEAVY FEE AT THE RATE OF £8 PER £100 WITH £4 FOR EVERY ADDITIONAL HUNDRED
LJ002-0195 BESIDES THESE A NUMBER HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF A RUN ON THE KEY WHICH ALLOWED A PRISONER TO GO INTO THE RULES FOR THE DAY
LJ002-0196 THE FOREGOING RENTALS AND PAYMENTS FOR PRIVILEGES TOGETHER WITH FEES EXACTED ON COMMITMENT AND DISCHARGE WENT TO THE MARSHAL OR KEEPER OF THE PRISON
LJ002-0197 WHOSE NET ANNUAL INCOME THUS ENTIRELY DERIVED FROM THE IMPECUNIOUS AMOUNTED TO BETWEEN THREE AND FOUR THOUSAND POUNDS
LJ002-0198 THE OFFICE OF MARSHAL HAD BEEN HEREDITARY
LJ002-0199 BUT IN THE 27TH GEORGE II THE RIGHT OF PRESENTATION WAS BOUGHT BY THE CROWN FOR £10500
LJ002-0200 THE MARSHAL WAS SUPPOSED TO BE RESIDENT EITHER WITHIN THE PRISON OR THE RULES
LJ002-0201 HE SEEMS TO HAVE FELT NO RESPONSIBILITY AS TO THE WELFARE OR COMFORT OF THOSE IN CHARGE AND OUT OF WHOM HE MADE ALL HIS MONEY
LJ002-0202 THE PRISON WAS ALWAYS IN THE MOST FILTHY STATE IMAGINABLE
LJ002-0203 THE HALF OR WHOLLY STARVED PRISONERS FISHED FOR ALMS OR FOOD AT THE GRATINGS
LJ002-0204 WHEN THEY WERE SICK NO MORE NOTICE WAS TAKEN OF THEM THAN OF A DOG
LJ002-0205 A MAN DYING OF LIVER COMPLAINT LAY ON THE COLD STONES WITHOUT A BED OR FOOD TO EAT
LJ002-0206 DISSOLUTE HABITS PREVAILED ON ALL SIDES DRUNKENNESS WAS UNIVERSAL GAMBLING PERPETUAL
LJ002-0207 THE YARDS WERE TAKEN UP WITH RACKETS AND FIVE COURTS AND HERE AND THERE WERE BUMBLE PUPPY GROUNDS A GAME IN WHICH THE PLAYERS ROLLED IRON BALLS
LJ002-0208 INTO HOLES MARKED WITH NUMBERS
LJ002-0209 HOW TO MAKE MOST PROFIT OUT OF THE WRETCHED DENIZENS OF THE JAIL WAS THE MARSHAL'S ONLY CARE HE GOT A RENT FOR THE COFFEEHOUSE AND THE BAKEHOUSE
LJ002-0210 THE KEEPER OF THE LARGE TAPROOM CALLED THE BRACE BECAUSE IT WAS ONCE KEPT BY TWO BROTHERS NAMED PARTRIDGE ALSO PAID HIM TOLL
LJ002-0211 THE SALE OF SPIRITS WAS FORBIDDEN BUT GIN COULD ALWAYS BE HAD AT THE WHISTLING SHOPS WHERE IT WAS KNOWN AS MOONSHINE SKY BLUE
LJ002-0212 MEXICO AND WAS CONSUMED AT THE RATE OF A HOGSHEAD PER WEEK
LJ002-0213 THE FLEET WHICH STOOD IN FARRINGDON STREET
LJ002-0214 WAS A PRISON FOR DEBTORS AND PERSONS COMMITTED FOR CONTEMPT BY THE COURTS OF CHANCERY EXCHEQUER AND COMMON PLEAS
LJ002-0215 IT WAS SO USED FOR THE DATE OF THE ABOLITION OF THE STAR CHAMBER IN THE 16TH CHARLES I
LJ002-0216 THE SHAMEFUL MALPRACTICES OF BAMBRIDGE
LJ002-0217 THE WARDEN OF THE FLEET AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY ARE TOO WELL KNOWN TO NEED MORE THAN A PASSING REFERENCE
LJ002-0218 A COMMITTEE OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS INVESTIGATED THE CHARGES AGAINST BAMBRIDGE WHO WAS PROVED TO HAVE CONNIVED AT THE ESCAPE OF SOME DEBTORS
LJ002-0219 AND TO HAVE BEEN GUILTY OF EXTORTION TO OTHERS ONE SIR WILLIAM RICH BART HE HAD LOADED WITH HEAVY IRONS
LJ002-0220 IN CONSEQUENCE OF THESE DISCLOSURES BOTH BAMBRIDGE AND HUGGIN HIS PREDECESSOR IN THE OFFICE WERE COMMITTED TO NEWGATE
LJ002-0221 AND MANY REFORMS INSTITUTED. BUT THE CONDITION OF THE PRISON AND ITS INMATES REMAINED UNSATISFACTORY TO THE LAST
LJ002-0222 IT CONTAINED GENERALLY FROM SIX TO SEVEN HUNDRED INMATES WHILE ANOTHER HUNDRED MORE OR LESS RESIDED IN THE RULES OUTSIDE
LJ002-0223 THE PRINCIPLE OF CHUMMAGE PREVAILED AS IN THE KING'S BENCH
LJ002-0224 BUT A NUMBER OF ROOMS FIFTEEN MORE OR LESS WERE RESERVED FOR POOR DEBTORS UNDER THE NAME OF BARTHOLOMEW FAIR
LJ002-0225 THE RENTALS OF ROOMS AND FEES WENT TO THE WARDEN WHOSE INCOME WAS £2372
LJ002-0226 THE SAME EVILS OF OVERCROWDING UNCLEANLINESS WANT OF MEDICAL ATTENDANCE
LJ002-0227 ABSENCE OR NEGLECT OF DIVINE SERVICE WERE PRESENT AS IN THE KING'S BENCH BUT IN AN EXAGGERATED FORM
LJ002-0228 THE COMMITTEE ON JAILS REPORTED THAT QUOTE ALTHOUGH THE HOUSE OF THE WARDEN LOOKED INTO THE COURT
LJ002-0229 AND THE TURNKEYS SLEPT IN THE PRISON YET SCENES OF RIOT DRUNKENNESS AND DISORDER WERE MOST PREVALENT END QUOTE
LJ002-0230 THE STATE OF MORALS WAS DISGRACEFUL. ANY WOMAN OBTAINED ADMISSION IF SOBER AND IF SHE GOT DRUNK SHE WAS NOT TURNED OUT
LJ002-0231 THERE WAS NO DISTINCT PLACE FOR THE FEMALE DEBTORS WHO LIVED IN THE SAME GALLERIES AS THE MEN
LJ002-0232 DISTURBANCES WERE FREQUENT OWING TO THE RIOTOUS CONDUCT OF INTOXICATED WOMEN
LJ002-0233 TWICE A WEEK THERE WAS A WINE AND BEER CLUB HELD AT NIGHT WHICH LASTED TILL TWO OR THREE IN THE MORNING
LJ002-0234 IN THE YARD BEHIND THE PRISON
LJ002-0235 WERE PLACES SET APART FOR SKITTLES FIVES AND TENNIS WHICH STRANGERS FREQUENTED AS ANY OTHER PLACE OF PUBLIC AMUSEMENT
LJ002-0236 MATTERS WERE RATHER BETTER AT THE MARSHALSEA
LJ002-0237 THIS VERY ANCIENT PRISON WHICH STOOD IN THE HIGH STREET SOUTHWARK
LJ002-0238 WAS USED FOR DEBTORS ARRESTED FOR THE LOWEST SUMS WITHIN TWELVE MILES OF THE PALACE OF WHITEHALL
LJ002-0239 ALSO FOR PRISONERS COMMITTED BY THE ADMIRALTY COURT
LJ002-0240 AT ONE TIME THE MARSHALSEA WAS THE RECEPTACLE OF PIRATES BUT NONE WERE COMMITTED TO IT AFTER SEVENTEEN EIGHTY NINE
LJ002-0241 THE COURT OF THE MARSHALSEA WAS INSTITUTED BY CHARLES I. IN THE SIXTH YEAR OF HIS REIGN
LJ002-0242 TO BE HELD BEFORE THE STEWARD OF THE ROYAL HOUSEHOLD THE KNIGHT MARSHAL AND THE STEWARD OF THE COURT
LJ002-0243 WITH JURISDICTION TO HOLD PLEAS IN ALL ACTIONS WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED LIMITS. THE COURT WAS CHIEFLY USED FOR THE RECOVERY OF SMALL DEBTS UNDER £10
LJ002-0244 BUT ITS BUSINESS WAS MUCH REDUCED BY THE EXTENSION OF THE COURTS OF CONSCIENCE
LJ002-0245 THE PRISON WAS A NEST OF ABUSES LIKE ITS NEIGHBOR THE KING'S BENCH
LJ002-0246 AND CAME UNDER THE STRONG ANIMADVERSION OF THE JAIL COMMITTEE OF SEVENTEEN TWENTY NINE
LJ002-0247 AS THE BUSINESS OF THE MARSHALSEA COURT DECLINED THE NUMBERS IN ITS PRISON DIMINISHED
LJ002-0248 THE POPULATION AS REPORTED BY THE COMMITTEE IN EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN AVERAGED ABOUT SIXTY
LJ002-0249 AND THE PRISON ALTHOUGH WIVES AND CHILDREN RESIDED WITHIN THE WALLS WAS NOT OVERCROWDED
LJ002-0250 THEIR CONDUCT TOO WAS ORDERLY ON THE WHOLE
LJ002-0251 DRUNKENNESS WAS NOT COMMON CHIEFLY BECAUSE LIQUOR WAS NOT TO BE HAD FREELY ALTHOUGH THE TAPSTER PAID A RENT OF TWO GUINEAS A WEEK FOR PERMISSION TO SELL IT
LJ002-0252 THE INMATES WHO EUPHEMISTICALLY STYLED THEMSELVES COLLEGIANS
LJ002-0253 WERE GOVERNED BY RULES WHICH THEY THEMSELVES HAD FRAMED AND UNDER WHICH SUBSCRIPTIONS WERE LEVIED
LJ002-0254 AND FINES IMPOSED FOR CONDUCT DISAPPROVED OF BY THE COLLEGE
LJ002-0255 A COURT OF THE COLLEGIANS WAS HELD EVERY MONDAY TO MANAGE ITS AFFAIRS AT WHICH ALL PRISONERS WERE REQUIRED TO ATTEND
LJ002-0256 A COMMITTEE OF COLLEGIANS WAS ELECTED TO ACT AS THE EXECUTIVE ALSO A SECRETARY OR ACCOUNTANT TO RECEIVE MONIES AND KEEP BOOKS
LJ002-0257 AND A MASTER OF THE ALEROOM WHO KEPT THIS THE SCENE OF THEIR REVELS CLEAN AND SAW THAT BOILING WATER WAS PROVIDED FOR GROG
LJ002-0258 BAD LANGUAGE QUARRELING THROWING WATER OVER ONE ANOTHER WAS FORBIDDEN ON PAIN OF FINE AND BEING SENT TO COVENTRY
LJ002-0259 BUT THE PREVAILING MORAL TONE MAY BE GUESSED FROM THE PENALTY INFLICTED UPON PERSONS SINGING OBSCENE SONGS BEFORE NINE P.M
LJ002-0260 YET THE PUBLIC OPINION OF THE WHOLE BODY SEEMS TO HAVE CHECKED DISSIPATION
LJ002-0261 THE POORER PRISONERS WERE NOT IN ABJECT WANT AS IN OTHER PRISONS
LJ002-0262 OWING TO MANY CHARITABLE GIFTS AND BEQUESTS WHICH INCLUDED ANNUAL DONATIONS FROM THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY
LJ002-0263 THE LORD STEWARD OF THE HOUSEHOLD THE STEWARD AND OFFICERS OF THE MARSHALSEA COURT AND OTHERS
LJ002-0264 LEGACIES HAD ALSO BEEN LEFT TO FREE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF DEBTORS NOTABLY THAT OF £100 PER ANNUM
LJ002-0265 LEFT BY A MR. HENRY ALLNUTT WHO WAS LONG A PRISONER IN THE MARSHALSEA AND CAME INTO A FORTUNE WHILE THERE
LJ002-0266 HIS BEQUEST WHICH WAS CHARGED UPON HIS MANOR AT GORING OXON AND HENCE CALLED THE OXFORD CHARITY
LJ002-0267 WAS APPLIED ONLY TO THE RELEASE OF POOR DEBTORS WHOM £4 EACH COULD FREE
LJ002-0268 THE SUPREME CONTROL OF THE MARSHALSEA WAS VESTED IN THE MARSHAL OF THE ROYAL HOUSEHOLD BUT ALTHOUGH HE DREW A SALARY OF £500 A YEAR
LJ002-0269 HE DID NOTHING BEYOND VISITING THE PRISON OCCASIONALLY AND LEFT THE ADMINISTRATION TO THE DEPUTY MARSHAL
LJ002-0270 THE LATTER'S SALARY WITH FEES THE RENT OF THE TAP AND OF THE CHANDLER'S SHOP AMOUNTED TO ABOUT £600 A YEAR
LJ002-0271 THE COMPTERS OF LUDGATE GILTSPUR STREET AND THE BOROUGH WERE DISCONTINUED AS DEBTORS' PRISONS AS WAS NEWGATE ALSO
LJ002-0272 ON THE OPENING OF WHITECROSS PRISON FOR DEBTORS IN 1815
LJ002-0273 LUDGATE TO THE LAST WAS THE DEBTORS' PRISON FOR FREEMEN OF THE CITY OF LONDON
LJ002-0274 CLERGYMEN PROCTORS ATTORNEYS AND PERSONS SPECIALLY SELECTED BY THE CORPORATION
LJ002-0275 AT ONE TIME THE LUDGATE DEBTORS ACCOMPANIED BY THE KEEPER
LJ002-0276 WENT OUTSIDE AND BEYOND THE PRISON TO CALL ON THEIR CREDITORS AND TRY TO ARRANGE THEIR DEBTS BUT THIS PRACTICE WAS DISCONTINUED
LJ002-0277 THERE WERE FIFTEEN ROOMS OF VARIOUS SIZES AND AS THE NUMBERS IMPRISONED RARELY EXCEEDED FIVEANDTWENTY THE PLACE WAS NEVER OVERCROWDED
LJ002-0278 WHILE THE FUNDS OF SEVERAL BEQUESTS AND CHARITIES WERE APPLIED IN ADDING TO THE MATERIAL COMFORT OF THE PRISONERS
LJ002-0279 THE GILTSPUR STREET COMPTER RECEIVED SHERIFFS' DEBTORS ALSO FELONS VAGRANTS AND NIGHT CHARGES
LJ002-0280 IT WAS GENERALLY CROWDED AS DEBTORS WHO WOULD HAVE GONE TO THE POULTRY COMPTER WERE SENT TO GILTSPUR STREET WHEN THE FORMER WAS CONDEMNED AS UNFIT TO RECEIVE PRISONERS
LJ002-0281 THE DEMANDS FOR FEES WERE EXCESSIVE IN GILTSPUR STREET
LJ002-0282 THOSE WHO COULD NOT PAY WERE THROWN INTO THE WARDS WITH THE NIGHT CHARGES
LJ002-0283 AND DENIED ADMISSION TO THE CHARITY WARDS WHICH PARTOOK OF ALL THE BENEFITS OF BEQUESTS AND DONATIONS TO POOR DEBTORS
LJ002-0284 THE BOROUGH COMPTER WAS IN A DISGRACEFUL STATE TO THE LAST. THE MEN'S WARD HAD AN EARTH OR RATHER A MUD FLOOR
LJ002-0285 AND WAS SO UNFIT TO SLEEP ON THAT IT HAD NOT BEEN USED FOR MANY YEARS SO THAT THE MEN AND WOMEN ASSOCIATED TOGETHER INDISCRIMINATELY
LJ002-0286 THE ROOMS HAD NO FIREPLACES SO IT MATTERED LITTLE THAT NO COALS WERE ALLOWED
LJ002-0287 THERE WERE NO BEDS OR BEDDING NO STRAW EVEN
LJ002-0288 IN ONE ROOM MR. NEILD FOUND A WOMAN ILL OF A FLUX SHUT UP WITH THREE MEN
LJ002-0289 THE LATTER RAISED EIGHTEEN PENCE AMONG THEM TO PAY FOR A TRUSS OF STRAW FOR THE POOR WOMAN TO LIE ON
LJ002-0290 NEILD FOUND THE PRISONERS IN THE BOROUGH COMPTER RAGGED STARVING AND DIRTY
LJ002-0291 I COME NOW TO THE DEBTORS IN NEWGATE. THE QUARTERS THEY OCCUPIED WERE DIVIDED AS I HAVE SAID INTO THREE PRINCIPAL DIVISIONS
LJ002-0292 THE MASTER'S SIDE THE CABIN SIDE AND THE COMMON SIDE PAYMENT OF A FEE OF THREE SHILLINGS GAINED THE DEBTOR ADMISSION TO THE TWO FIRST NAMED
LJ002-0293 THOSE WHO COULD PAY NOTHING WENT AS A MATTER OF COURSE TO THE COMMON SIDE
LJ002-0294 A FURTHER FEE WAS HOWEVER DEMANDED FROM THE NEWCOMER BEFORE HE WAS MADE FREE OF EITHER THE MASTER'S OR THE CABIN SIDE
LJ002-0295 THIS WAS THE REPREHENSIBLE CLAIM FOR GARNISH WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN ABOLISHED IN ALL WELLCONDUCTED PRISONS BUT WHICH STILL WAS DEMANDED IN NEWGATE
LJ002-0296 GARNISH ON THE CABIN SIDE WAS A GUINEA AT ENTRANCE FOR COALS CANDLES BROOMS ETC. AND A GALLON OF BEER ON DISCHARGE
LJ002-0297 ON THE MASTER'S SIDE IT WAS THIRTEEN AND FOURPENCE AND A GALLON OF BEER ON ENTRANCE ALTHOUGH MR. NEWMAN
LJ002-0298 IN HIS EVIDENCE IN EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN SAID IT WAS MORE
LJ002-0299 AND GAVE THE GARNISH FOR THE COMMON SIDE AT THAT SUM WHICH IS FIVE SHILLINGS MORE THAN MR. NEILD SAYS WAS EXTORTED ON THE COMMON SIDE
LJ002-0300 NUMEROUS TYRANNIES WERE PRACTICED ON ALL WHO WOULD NOT AND COULD NOT PAY THE GARNISH
LJ002-0301 THEY WERE MADE TO WASH AND SWAB THE WARD OR THEY WERE SHUT OUT FROM THE WARD FIREPLACE AND FORBIDDEN TO PASS A CHALKED LINE DRAWN ON THE FLOOR
LJ002-0302 AND SO WERE UNABLE EITHER TO WARM THEMSELVES OR TO COOK THEIR FOOD
LJ002-0303 BESIDES THESE FEES LEGITIMATE AND ILLEGITIMATE THERE WERE OTHERS WHICH MUST BE PAID BEFORE RELEASE
LJ002-0304 THE SHERIFF DEMANDED FOUR SHILLINGS SIX PENCE FOR HIS LIBERATE THE JAILER SIX SHILLINGS TEN PENCE MORE AND THE TURNKEY TWO SHILLINGS
LJ002-0305 AND THUS WHEN THE DEBTOR'S DEBT HAD BEEN ACTUALLY PAID OR WHEN HE HAD ABANDONED HIS PROPERTY TO THE CREDITORS AND ALMOST DESTITUTE
LJ002-0306 LOOKED FORWARD TO HIS LIBERTY HE WAS STILL DELAYED UNTIL HE HAD PAID A NEW DEBT ARISING QUOTE
LJ002-0307 ONLY OUT OF A SATISFACTION OF ALL HIS FORMER DEBTS END QUOTE THE FEES WERE NOT ALWAYS EXTORTED IT IS TRUE
LJ002-0308 NOR WAS NONPAYMENT MADE A PRETEXT FOR FURTHER IMPRISONMENT THANKS TO THE HUMANITY OF THE JAILER OR THE FUNDS PROVIDED BY VARIOUS CHARITIES
LJ002-0309 THERE WAS THIS MUCH HONEST FORBEARANCE IN NEWGATE IN THESE DAYS
LJ002-0310 THAT DEBTORS WHO COULD AFFORD THE CABIN AND MASTER'S SIDE WERE NOT PERMITTED TO SHARE IN THE PRISON CHARITIES
LJ002-0311 THESE WERE LUMPED TOGETHER INTO A GENERAL FUND
LJ002-0312 AND A CALCULATION MADE AS TO THE AMOUNT THAT MIGHT BE EXPENDED PER WEEK FROM THE WHOLE SUM SO THAT THE LATTER MIGHT LAST OUT THE YEAR
LJ002-0313 IT GENERALLY RAN TO ABOUT SIX POUNDS PER WEEK. THE MONEY WHICH AT ONE TIME HAD BEEN DISTRIBUTED QUARTERLY AND ALL WENT IN DRINK
LJ002-0314 WAS AFTER 1807 THROUGH THE EXERTIONS OF THE KEEPER OF THE JAIL SPENT IN THE PURCHASE OF NECESSARIES
LJ002-0315 BUT THIS WEEKLY PITTANCE DID NOT GO FAR WHEN THE DEBTORS' SIDE WAS CROWDED AS IT OFTEN WAS
LJ002-0316 NOTABLY AS WHEN NUMBERS FILLED NEWGATE IN ANTICIPATION OF LORD REDESDALE'S BILL FOR INSOLVENT DEBTORS
LJ002-0317 AND THERE WERE AS MANY AS THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PRISONERS IN AT ONE TIME
LJ002-0318 THE CITY ALSO ALLOWED THE POOR DEBTORS FOURTEEN OUNCES OF BREAD DAILY AND THEIR SHARE OF EIGHT STONE OF MEAT AN ALLOWANCE WHICH NEVER VARIED
LJ002-0319 ISSUED ONCE A WEEK AND DIVIDED AS FAR AS IT WOULD GO  A VERY PRECARIOUS AND UNCERTAIN RATION
LJ002-0320 THE BREAD WAS ISSUED EVERY ALTERNATE DAY AND WHILE SOME PRISONERS OFTEN ATE THEIR WHOLE ALLOWANCE AT ONCE
LJ002-0321 OTHERS WHO ARRIVED JUST AFTER THE TIME OF DISTRIBUTION WERE OFTEN FORTYEIGHT HOURS WITHOUT FOOD. THE LATTER MIGHT ALSO BE SIX DAYS WITHOUT MEAT
LJ002-0322 SHARE IN THE WEEKLY ALLOWANCE OF MEAT MIGHT ALSO BE DENIED TO DEBTORS WHO HAD NOT PAID GARNISH AS WELL AS IN THE WEEKLY GRANT FROM THE CHARITABLE FUND
LJ002-0323 HENCE STARVATION STARED MANY IN THE FACE UNLESS FRIENDS FROM OUTSIDE CAME TO THEIR ASSISTANCE
LJ002-0324 OR THE KEEPER MADE THEM A SPECIAL GRANT OF SIX PENCE PER DIEM OUT OF THE COMMON STOCK
LJ002-0325 OR THE SIXPENNY ALLOWANCE WAS CLAIMED FOR THE CREDITORS WHICH SELDOM HAPPENED OWING TO THE EXPENSE THE PROCESS ENTAILED
LJ002-0326 THE POOR DEBTORS WERE NOT SUPPLIED WITH BEDS. THOSE WHO COULD PAY THE PRICE MIGHT HIRE THEM FROM EACH OTHER
LJ002-0327 OR FROM PERSONS WHO MADE A TRADE OF IT OR THEY MIGHT BRING THEIR BEDS WITH THEM INTO THE PRISON
LJ002-0328 FAILING ANY OF THESE METHODS SEEING THAT STRAW WAS FORBIDDEN FOR FEAR OF FIRE THEY HAD TO BE SATISFIED WITH A COUPLE OF THE RUGS PROVIDED BY THE CITY
LJ002-0329 THE SUPPLY OF WHICH WAS HOWEVER LIMITED AND THERE WERE NOT ALWAYS ENOUGH TO GIVE BEDDING TO ALL THE STOCK WAS DIMINISHED BY THEFT
LJ002-0330 FEMALE VISITORS CARRIED THEM OUT OF THE PRISONS OR THE DEBTORS DESTROYED THEM WHEN THE WEATHER WAS WARM
LJ002-0331 AND THEY WERE NOT IN GREAT DEMAND IN ORDER TO CONVERT THEM INTO MOPHEADS OR CLEANINGRAGS
LJ002-0332 SOMETIMES RUGS WERE URGENTLY REQUIRED AND NOT FORTHCOMING
LJ002-0333 A SEVERE WINTER SET IN THE NEW STOCK HAD NOT BEEN SUPPLIED BY THE CONTRACTORS AND THE POOR DEBTORS PERISHED OF COLD
LJ002-0334 AGAIN THERE WAS NO REGULAR ALLOWANCE OF FUEL COALS WERE PURCHASED OUT OF THE GARNISH MONEY AND THE CHARITABLE FUND
LJ002-0335 SO WERE CANDLES SALT PEPPER MOPS AND BROOMS BUT THE LATTER COULD HAVE BEEN OF LITTLE SERVICE DIRT PREVAILED EVERYWHERE
LJ002-0336 INDEED THE PLACE WITH ITS OAK FLOORS CAULKED WITH PITCH AND SMOKED CEILINGS
LJ002-0337 COULD NOT BE MADE EVEN TO LOOK CLEAN WHILE THERE WAS NO OBLIGATION OF PERSONAL CLEANLINESS ON INDIVIDUALS WHO OFTEN CAME INTO THE PRISON IN FILTHY RAGS
LJ002-0338 ONLY NOW AND AGAIN IN EXTREME CASES AN UNUSUALLY NASTY COMPANION WAS STRIPPED HALED TO THE PUMP
LJ003-0001 THE CHRONICLES OF NEWGATE VOLUME 2. BY ARTHUR GRIFFITHS. SECTION 5 NEWGATE DOWN TO EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN PART 2
LJ003-0002 THE SQUALOR AND UNCLEANNESS OF THE DEBTORS' SIDE WAS INTENSIFIED BY CONSTANT OVERCROWDING
LJ003-0003 PRISONERS WERE COMMITTED TO IT QUITE WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ITS CAPACITY
LJ003-0004 NO REMONSTRANCE WAS ATTENDED TO
LJ003-0005 NO STEPS TAKEN TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF COMMITTALS AND THE GOVERNOR WAS OBLIGED TO UTILIZE THE CHAPEL AS A DAY AND NIGHT ROOM
LJ003-0006 BESIDES THIS ALTHOUGH THE FAMILIES OF DEBTORS WERE NO LONGER PERMITTED TO LIVE WITH THEM INSIDE THE JAIL
LJ003-0007 HUNDREDS OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN CAME IN EVERY MORNING TO SPEND THE DAY THERE AND THERE WAS NO LIMITATION WHATEVER TO THE NUMBERS OF VISITORS ADMITTED TO THE DEBTORS' SIDE
LJ003-0008 FRIENDS ARRIVED ABOUT NINE A.M. AND WENT OUT AT NINE P.M. WHEN AS MANY AS TWO HUNDRED VISITORS HAVE BEEN OBSERVED LEAVING THE DEBTORS' YARDS AT ONE TIME
LJ003-0009 THE DAY PASSED IN REVELRY AND DRUNKENNESS. ALTHOUGH SPIRITUOUS LIQUORS WERE FORBIDDEN
LJ003-0010 WINE AND BEER MIGHT BE HAD IN ANY QUANTITY THE ONLY LIMITATION BEING
LJ003-0011 THAT NOT MORE THAN ONE BOTTLE OF WINE OR ONE QUART OF BEER COULD BE ISSUED AT ONE TIME. NO ACCOUNT WAS TAKEN OF THE AMOUNT OF LIQUORS ADMITTED IN ONE DAY
LJ003-0012 AND DEBTORS MIGHT PRACTICALLY HAVE AS MUCH AS THEY LIKED IF THEY COULD ONLY PAY FOR IT
LJ003-0013 NO ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO CHECK DRUNKENNESS BEYOND THE PENALTY OF SHUTTING OUT FRIENDS FROM ANY WARD IN WHICH A PRISONER EXCEEDED
LJ003-0014 QUARRELING AMONG THE DEBTORS WAS NOT UNFREQUENT BLOWS WERE STRUCK AND FIGHTS OFTEN ENSUED
LJ003-0015 FOR THIS AND OTHER ACTS OF MISCONDUCT THERE WAS THE DISCIPLINE OF THE REFRACTORY WARD OR STRONG ROOM ON THE DEBTORS' SIDE
LJ003-0016 BAD CASES WERE REMOVED TO A CELL ON THE FELONS' SIDE AND HERE THEY WERE LOCKED IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT FOR THREE DAYS AT A TIME
LJ003-0017 ORDER THROUGHOUT THE DEBTORS' SIDE WAS PRESERVED
LJ003-0018 AND DISCIPLINE MAINTAINED BY A SYSTEM OPEN TO GRAVE ABUSES AND WHICH HAD THE PRESCRIPTION OF LONG USAGE
LJ003-0019 AND WHICH WAS NEVER WHOLLY ROOTED OUT FOR MANY YEARS TO COME
LJ003-0020 THIS WAS THE PERNICIOUS PLAN OF GOVERNING BY PRISONERS OR OF SETTING A FAVORED FEW IN AUTHORITY OVER THE MANY
LJ003-0021 THE HEAD OF THE DEBTORS' PRISON WAS A PRISONER CALLED THE STEWARD WHO WAS CHOSEN BY THE WHOLE BODY FROM SIX WHOM THE KEEPER NOMINATED
LJ003-0022 THIS STEWARD WAS PRACTICALLY SUPREME
LJ003-0023 ALL THE ALLOWANCES OF FOOD PASSED THROUGH HIS HANDS HE HAD THE CONTROL OF THE POORBOX FOR CHANCE CHARITIES
LJ003-0024 HE COLLECTED THE GARNISH MONEY AND DISTRIBUTED THE WEEKLY GRANT FROM THE PRISON CHARITABLE FUND
LJ003-0025 IN THE LATTER DUTIES HE WAS HOWEVER SUPERVISED BY THREE AUDITORS FREELY CHOSEN BY THE PRISONERS AMONG THEMSELVES
LJ003-0026 THE AUDITORS WERE PAID A SHILLING EACH FOR THEIR SERVICES EACH TIME THE POORBOX WAS OPENED. THE STEWARD WAS ALSO REMUNERATED FOR HIS TROUBLE
LJ003-0027 HE HAD A DOUBLE ALLOWANCE OF BREAD DEDUCTED OF COURSE FROM THE ALREADY TOO LIMITED PORTION OF THE REST
LJ003-0028 AND NO DOUBT MADE THE MEAT ALSO PAY TOLL
LJ003-0029 UNDER THE STEWARD THERE WERE CAPTAINS OF WARDS CHOSEN IN THE SAME WAY AND PERFORMING ANALOGOUS DUTIES
LJ003-0030 THESE SUBORDINATE CHIEFS WERE ALSO REWARDED OUT OF THE SCANTY PRISON RATIONS
LJ003-0031 THE SAME SYSTEM WAS EXTENDED TO THE CRIMINAL SIDE AND CASES WERE ON RECORD OF THE PLACE OF WARDSMAN BEING SOLD FOR CONSIDERABLE SUMS
LJ003-0032 SO VALUABLE WERE THEY DEEMED THAT AS MUCH AS FIFTY GUINEAS WAS OFFERED TO THE KEEPER FOR THE POST
LJ003-0033 ENOUGH HAS BEEN SAID PROBABLY TO PROVE THAT THERE WAS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THE CONDITION AND TREATMENT OF DEBTORS IN THE PRISONS OF THE CITY OF LONDON
LJ003-0034 THIS GRADUALLY WAS FORCED UPON THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE CORPORATION
LJ003-0035 AND ABOUT EIGHTEEN TWELVE APPLICATION WAS MADE TO PARLIAMENT FOR FUNDS TO BUILD A NEW DEBTORS' PRISON
LJ003-0036 AUTHORITY WAS GIVEN TO RAISE MONEY ON THE ORPHANS' FUND TO THE EXTENT OF £90000
LJ003-0037 A SITE WAS PURCHASED BETWEEN RED LION AND WHITE CROSS STREETS AND A NEW PRISON PLANNED
LJ003-0038 WHICH WOULD ACCOMMODATE THE INMATES OF NEWGATE AND OF THE THREE COMPTERS LUDGATE
LJ003-0039 GILTSPUR STREET AND THE POULTRY OR ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTYSIX IN ALL
LJ003-0040 THE EVILS OF ASSOCIATION FOR THESE DEBTORS WERE PERPETUATED ALTHOUGH THE PLAN PROVIDED FOR THE SEPARATION OF THE VARIOUS CONTINGENTS COMMITTED TO IT
LJ003-0041 THERE WAS NO LACK OF AIR AND LIGHT FOR THE NEW JAIL AND SEVERAL EXERCISING YARDS
LJ003-0042 THE COMPLETION OF THIS VERY NECESSARY BUILDING WAS HOWEVER MUCH DELAYED FOR WANT OF FUNDS
LJ003-0043 AND IT WAS NOT READY TO RELIEVE NEWGATE TILL LATE IN EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN
LJ003-0044 THE REFORMS WHICH WERE TO BE ATTEMPTED IN THAT PRISON
LJ003-0045 MORE PARTICULARLY AS REGARDED THE CLASSIFICATION OF PRISONERS AND WHICH WERE DEPENDENT ON THE SPACE TO BE GAINED BY THE REMOVAL OF THE DEBTORS
LJ003-0046 COULD NOT BE CARRIED OUT TILL THEN IT IS TO BE FEARED THAT LONG AFTER THE OPENING OF WHITE CROSS STREET PRISON
LJ003-0047 NEWGATE CONTINUED TO BE A REPROACH TO THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS MANAGEMENT
LJ003-0048 I PASS NOW TO THE CRIMINAL SIDE OF NEWGATE WHICH CONSISTED OF THE SIX QUARTERS OR YARDS ALREADY ENUMERATED AND DESCRIBED
LJ003-0049 THE INMATES OF THIS PART AS DISTINGUISHED FROM THE DEBTORS WERE COMPRISED IN FOUR CLASSES
LJ003-0050 ONE THOSE AWAITING TRIAL
LJ003-0051 TWO PERSONS UNDER SENTENCE OF IMPRISONMENT FOR A FIXED PERIOD OR UNTIL THEY SHALL HAVE PAID CERTAIN FINES
LJ003-0052 THREE TRANSPORTS AWAITING REMOVAL TO THE COLONIES AND FOUR CAPITAL CONVICTS CONDEMNED TO DEATH AND AWAITING EXECUTION
LJ003-0053 AT ONE TIME THE WHOLE OF THESE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES WERE THROWN TOGETHER PELLMELL YOUNG AND OLD THE UNTRIED WITH THE CONVICTED
LJ003-0054 AN IMPERFECT ATTEMPT AT CLASSIFICATION WAS HOWEVER MADE IN EIGHTEEN TWELVE AND A YARD WAS AS FAR AS POSSIBLE SET APART FOR THE UNTRIED
LJ003-0055 OR CLASS ONE WITH WHOM UNDER THE IMPERIOUS DEMAND FOR ACCOMMODATION WERE ALSO ASSOCIATED THE MISDEMEANANTS OR CLASS TWO
LJ003-0056 THIS WAS THE CHAPEL YARD WITH ITS FIVE WARDS WHICH WERE CALCULATED TO HOLD SEVENTY PRISONERS BUT OFTEN HELD MANY MORE
LJ003-0057 A FURTHER SUBCLASSIFICATION WAS ATTEMPTED BY SEPARATING AT NIGHT THOSE CHARGED WITH MISDEMEANORS FROM THOSE CHARGED WITH FELONY
LJ003-0058 BUT ALL MINGLED FREELY DURING THE DAY IN THE YARD
LJ003-0059 THE SLEEPING ACCOMMODATION IN THE CHAPELYARD WARDS AND INDEED THROUGHOUT THE PRISON CONSISTED OF A BARRACK BED
LJ003-0060 WHICH WAS A WOODEN FLOORING ON A SLIGHTLY INCLINED PLANE WITH A BEAM RUNNING ACROSS THE TOP TO SERVE AS A PILLOW
LJ003-0061 NO BEDS WERE ISSUED ONLY TWO RUGS PER PRISONER
LJ003-0062 WHEN EACH SLEEPER HAD THE FULL LATERAL SPACE ALLOTTED TO HIM IT AMOUNTED TO ONE FOOT AND A HALF ON THE BARRACK BED
LJ003-0063 BUT WHEN THE WARD WAS OBLIGED TO ACCOMMODATE DOUBLE THE ORDINARY NUMBER AS WAS FREQUENTLY THE CASE
LJ003-0064 THE SLEEPERS COVERED THE ENTIRE FLOOR WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A PASSAGE IN THE MIDDLE
LJ003-0065 ALL THE MISDEMEANANTS WHATEVER THEIR OFFENSE WERE LODGED IN THIS CHAPEL WARD
LJ003-0066 AS MANY VARIOUS AND ACCORDING TO OUR IDEAS HEINOUS CRIMES CAME UNDER THIS HEAD
LJ003-0067 IN THE THEN EXISTING STATE OF THE LAW
LJ003-0068 THE MAN GUILTY OF A COMMON ASSAULT FOUND HIMSELF SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE FRAUDULENT OR OTHERS WHO HAD ATTEMPTED ABOMINABLE CRIMES
LJ003-0069 IN THIS HETEROGENEOUS SOCIETY WERE ALSO THROWN THE UNFORTUNATE JOURNALISTS TO WHOM I HAVE ALREADY REFERRED AND ON WHOM IMPRISONMENT IN NEWGATE
LJ003-0070 WAS FREQUENTLY ADJUDGED FOR SOCALLED LIBELS OR TOO OUTSPOKEN COMMENTS IN PRINT
LJ003-0071 IT WAS PARTICULARLY RECOMMENDED BY THE COMMITTEE ON JAILS IN EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN
LJ003-0072 THAT SOME OTHER AND LESS MIXED PRISON SHOULD BE USED FOR THE CONFINEMENT OF PERSONS CONVICTED OF LIBELS BUT THIS SUGGESTION WAS IGNORED
LJ003-0073 INDEED THE PARTIAL CLASSIFICATION ATTEMPTED SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN ABANDONED WITHIN A YEAR OR TWO
LJ003-0074 THE HON. H. G. BENNET WHO VISITED NEWGATE IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTEEN SAW IN ONE YARD IN A TOTAL OF SEVENTYTWO PRISONERS
LJ003-0075 THIRTYFIVE TRIED AND THIRTYSEVEN UNTRIED OF THE FORMER THREE WERE TRANSPORTS FOR LIFE
LJ003-0076 FOUR FOR FOURTEEN YEARS AND THREE OF THEM PERSONS SENTENCED TO FINES OR SHORT IMPRISONMENT  ONE FOR LITTLE MORE THAN A MONTH
LJ003-0077 TWO OF THE UNTRIED WERE FOR MURDER AND SEVERAL FOR HOUSEBREAKING AND HIGHWAY ROBBERY
LJ003-0078 NOR WERE THE MISDEMEANANTS AND BAIL PRISONERS ANY LONGER SEPARATED FROM THOSE WHOSE CRIMES WERE OF A MORE SERIOUS CHARACTER
LJ003-0079 MR. BENNET REFERS TO A GENTLEMAN CONFINED FOR WANT OF BAIL WHO OCCUPIED A ROOM WITH FIVE OTHERS
LJ003-0080 TWO COMMITTED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COMMISSIONER ONE FOR PERJURY AND TWO TRANSPORTS
LJ003-0081 PERSONS CONVICTED OF PUBLISHING LIBELS WERE STILL IMMURED IN THE SAME ROOMS WITH TRANSPORTS AND FELONS
LJ003-0082 THE MIDDLE YARD AS FAR AS ITS LIMITS WOULD PERMIT WAS APPROPRIATED TO FELONS AND TRANSPORTS THE WARDS HERE WERE GENERALLY VERY CROWDED
LJ003-0083 EACH WARD WAS CALCULATED TO HOLD TWENTYFOUR ALLOWING EACH INDIVIDUAL ONE FOOT AND A HALF
LJ003-0084 QUOTE A COMMONSIZED MAN SAYS THE KEEPER MR. NEWMAN CAN TURN IN NINETEEN INCHES END QUOTE
LJ003-0085 THESE TWENTYFOUR COULD JUST SLEEP ON THE BARRACK BED WHEN THE NUMBER WAS HIGHER AND IT OFTEN ROSE TO FORTY THE SURPLUS HAD TO SLEEP ON THE FLOOR
LJ003-0086 THE CROWDING WAS IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE DELAY IN REMOVING TRANSPORTS
LJ003-0087 THESE OFTEN REMAINED IN NEWGATE FOR SIX MONTHS SOMETIMES A YEAR IN SOME CASES LONGER
LJ003-0088 IN ONE FOR SEVEN YEARS  THAT OF A MAN SENTENCED TO DEATH FOR WHOM GREAT INTEREST HAD BEEN MADE BUT WHOM IT WAS NOT THOUGHT RIGHT TO PARDON
LJ003-0089 OCCASIONALLY THE TRANSPORTS MADE THEMSELVES SO USEFUL IN THE JAIL THAT THEY WERE PASSED OVER
LJ003-0090 MR. NEWMAN ADMITTED THAT HE HAD PETITIONED THAT CERTAIN TRUSTY MEN MIGHT BE LEFT IN THE JAIL
LJ003-0091 CONSTANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THESE CONVICTED FELONS WERE NUMBERS OF JUVENILES INFANTS OF TENDER YEARS
LJ003-0092 THERE WERE FREQUENTLY IN THE MIDDLE YARD SEVEN OR EIGHT CHILDREN THE YOUNGEST BARELY NINE
LJ003-0093 THE OLDEST ONLY TWELVE OR THIRTEEN EXPOSED TO ALL THE CONTAMINATING INFLUENCES OF THE PLACE
LJ003-0094 MR. BENNET MENTIONS ALSO THE CASE OF YOUNG MEN OF BETTER STAMP CLERKS IN CITY OFFICES AND YOUTHS OF GOOD PARENTAGE
LJ003-0095 QUOTE IN THIS DREADFUL SITUATION END QUOTE WHO HAD BEEN RESCUED FROM THE HULKS THROUGH THE KINDNESS AND ATTENTION OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE
LJ003-0096 QUOTE YET THEY HAD BEEN LONG ENOUGH HE GOES ON TO SAY IN THE PRISON ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOWEST AND VILEST CRIMINALS
LJ003-0097 WITH CONVICTS OF ALL AGES AND CHARACTERS TO RENDER IT NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE BUT THAT WITH THE OBLITERATION OF ALL SENSE OF SELFRESPECT
LJ003-0098 THE INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCE OF SUCH A SITUATION THEIR MORALS MUST HAVE BEEN DESTROYED
LJ003-0099 AND THOUGH DISTRESS OR THE SEDUCTION OF OTHERS MIGHT HAVE LED TO THE COMMISSION OF THIS THEIR FIRST OFFENSE
LJ003-0100 YET THE SOCIETY THEY WERE DRIVEN TO LIVE IN THE LANGUAGE THEY DAILY HEARD AND THE LESSONS THEY WERE TAUGHT IN THIS ACADEMY
LJ003-0101 MUST HAVE HAD A TENDENCY TO TURN THEM INTO THE WORLD HARDENED AND ACCOMPLISHED IN THE WAYS OF VICE AND CRIME END QUOTE
LJ003-0102 MR. BUXTON IN THE WORK ALREADY QUOTED INSTANCES ANOTHER GRIEVOUS CASE OF THE HORRORS OF INDISCRIMINATE ASSOCIATION IN NEWGATE
LJ003-0103 IT WAS THAT OF A PERSON QUOTE WHO PRACTICED IN THE LAW AND WHO WAS CONNECTED BY MARRIAGE WITH SOME VERY RESPECTABLE FAMILIES
LJ003-0104 HAVING BEEN COMMITTED TO CLERKENWELL
LJ003-0105 HE WAS SENT ON TO NEWGATE IN A COACH HANDCUFFED TO A NOTED HOUSEBREAKER WHO WAS AFTERWARDS CAST FOR DEATH
LJ003-0106 THE FIRST NIGHT IN NEWGATE AND FOR THE SUBSEQUENT FORTNIGHT
LJ003-0107 HE SLEPT IN THE SAME BED WITH A HIGHWAYMAN ON ONE SIDE AND A MAN CHARGED WITH MURDER ON THE OTHER
LJ003-0108 SPIRITS WERE FREELY INTRODUCED AND ALTHOUGH HE AT FIRST ABSTAINED
LJ003-0109 HE FOUND HE MUST ADOPT THE MANNERS OF HIS COMPANIONS OR THAT HIS LIFE WOULD BE IN DANGER
LJ003-0110 THEY VIEWED HIM WITH SOME SUSPICION AS ONE OF WHOM THEY KNEW NOTHING
LJ003-0111 HE WAS IN CONSEQUENCE PUT OUT OF THE PROTECTION OF THEIR INTERNAL LAW END QUOTE. THEIR CODE WAS A SUBJECT OF SOME CURIOSITY
LJ003-0112 WHEN ANY PRISONER COMMITTED AN OFFENSE AGAINST THE COMMUNITY OR AGAINST AN INDIVIDUAL HE WAS TRIED BY A COURT IN THE JAIL
LJ003-0113 A PRISONER GENERALLY THE OLDEST AND MOST DEXTEROUS THIEF
LJ003-0114 WAS APPOINTED JUDGE AND A TOWEL TIED IN KNOTS WAS HUNG ON EACH SIDE IN IMITATION OF A WIG
LJ003-0115 THE JUDGE SAT IN PROPER FORM HE WAS PUNCTILIOUSLY STYLED MY LORD
LJ003-0116 A JURY HAVING BEEN SELECTED AND DULY SWORN THE CULPRIT WAS THEN ARRAIGNED. JUSTICE HOWEVER WAS NOT ADMINISTERED WITH ABSOLUTE INTEGRITY
LJ003-0117 A BRIBE TO THE JUDGE WAS CERTAIN TO SECURE ACQUITTAL AND THE NEGLECT OF THE FORMALITY WAS AS CERTAINLY FOLLOWED BY CONDEMNATION
LJ003-0118 VARIOUS PUNISHMENTS WERE INFLICTED THE HEAVIEST OF WHICH WAS STANDING IN THE PILLORY
LJ003-0119 THIS WAS CARRIED OUT BY PUTTING THE CRIMINAL'S HEAD THROUGH THE LEGS OF A CHAIR AND STRETCHING OUT HIS ARMS AND TYING THEM TO THE LEGS
LJ003-0120 THE CULPRIT WAS THEN COMPELLED TO CARRY THE CHAIR ABOUT WITH HIM
LJ003-0121 BUT ALL PUNISHMENTS MIGHT READILY BE COMMUTED INTO A FINE TO BE SPENT IN GIN FOR JUDGE AND JURY
LJ003-0122 THE PRISONER MENTIONED ABOVE WAS CONTINUALLY PERSECUTED BY TRIALS OF THIS KIND
LJ003-0123 THE MOST TRIFLING ACTS WERE MAGNIFIED INTO OFFENSES
LJ003-0124 HE WAS CHARGED WITH MOVING SOMETHING WHICH SHOULD NOT BE TOUCHED WITH LEAVING A DOOR OPEN OR COUGHING MALICIOUSLY TO THE DISTURBANCE OF HIS COMPANIONS
LJ003-0125 THE EVIDENCE WAS INVARIABLY SUFFICIENT TO CONVICT AND THE JUDGE NEVER HESITATED TO INFLICT THE HEAVIEST PENALTIES
LJ003-0126 THE UNFORTUNATE MAN WAS COMPELLED AT LENGTH TO ADOPT THE HABITS OF HIS ASSOCIATES
LJ003-0127 QUOTE BY INSENSIBLE DEGREES HE BEGAN TO LOSE HIS REPUGNANCE TO THEIR SOCIETY
LJ003-0128 CAUGHT THEIR FLASH TERMS AND SUNG THEIR SONGS WAS ADMITTED TO THEIR REVELS AND ACQUIRED IN PLACE OF HABITS OF PERFECT SOBRIETY
LJ003-0129 A TASTE FOR SPIRITS. END QUOTE
LJ003-0130 HIS WIFE VISITED HIM IN NEWGATE AND WROTE A PITIABLE ACCOUNT OF THE STATE IN WHICH SHE FOUND HER HUSBAND
LJ003-0131 HE WAS AN INMATE OF THE SAME WARD WITH OTHERS OF THE MOST DREADFUL SORT QUOTE
LJ003-0132 WHOSE LANGUAGE AND MANNERS WHOSE FEMALE ASSOCIATES OF THE MOST ABANDONED DESCRIPTION AND THE SCENES CONSEQUENT WITH SUCH LOST WRETCHES
LJ003-0133 PREVENTED ME FROM GOING INSIDE BUT SELDOM AND I USED TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIM THROUGH THE BARS FROM THE PASSAGE. END QUOTE
LJ003-0134 ONE DAY HE WAS TOO ILL TO COME DOWN AND MEET HER
LJ003-0135 SHE WENT UP TO THE WARD AND FOUND HIM LYING DOWN QUOTE
LJ003-0136 PALE AS DEATH VERY ILL AND IN A DREADFULLY DIRTY STATE THE WRETCHES MAKING GAME OF HIM AND ENJOYING MY DISTRESS
LJ003-0137 AND I LEARNED HE HAD BEEN UP WITH THE OTHERS THE WHOLE NIGHT
LJ003-0138 THOUGH THEY COULD NOT FORCE HIM TO GAMBLE HE WAS COMPELLED TO DRINK
LJ003-0139 AND I WAS OBLIGED AFTERWARDS TO LET HIM HAVE FIVE SHILLINGS TO PAY HIS SHARE
LJ003-0140 OTHERWISE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN STRIPPED OF HIS CLOTHES. END QUOTE
LJ003-0141 FELONS WHO COULD PAY THE PRICE WERE PERMITTED IRRESPECTIVE OF THEIR CHARACTER OR OFFENSES
LJ003-0142 TO PURCHASE THE GREATER EASE AND COMFORT OF THE MASTER'S SIDE
LJ003-0143 THE ENTRANCE FEE WAS AT LEAST THIRTEEN SHILLINGS SIX PENCE A HEAD WITH HALFACROWN A WEEK MORE FOR BED AND BEDDING
LJ003-0144 THE WARDS BEING FURNISHED WITH BARRACK BEDSTEADS UPON WHICH EACH PRISONER HAD THE REGULATION ALLOWANCE OF SLEEPING ROOM
LJ003-0145 OR ABOUT A FOOT AND A HALF LATERALLY THESE FEES WERE IN REALITY A SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE EXPENSES OF THE JAIL
LJ003-0146 WITHOUT THEM THE KEEPER DECLARED THAT HE COULD NOT PAY THE SALARIES OF TURNKEYS AND SERVANTS NOR KEEP THE PRISON GOING AT ALL
LJ003-0147 BESIDES THE JAIL FEES THERE WAS GARNISH OF HALFAGUINEA COLLECTED BY THE STEWARD
LJ003-0148 AND SPENT IN PROVIDING COALS CANDLES PLATES KNIVES AND FORKS WHILE ALL THE OCCUPANTS OF THIS PART OF THE PRISON
LJ003-0149 SUPPORTED THEMSELVES THEY HAD THE RATION OF PRISON BREAD ONLY
LJ003-0150 BUT THEY HAD NO SHARE IN THE PRISON MEAT OR OTHER CHARITIES AND THEY OR THEIR FRIENDS FOUND THEM IN FOOD
LJ003-0151 ALL WHO COULD SCRAPE TOGETHER THE CASH SEEM TO HAVE GLADLY AVAILED THEMSELVES OF THE PRIVILEGE OF ENTERING THE MASTER'S SIDE
LJ003-0152 IT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO ESCAPE THE HORRORS THE DISTRESS PENURY AND RAGS OF THE COMMON YARDS
LJ003-0153 IDLENESS WAS NOT SO UNIVERSALLY THE RULE IN THIS PART OF THE JAIL
LJ003-0154 ARTISANS AND OTHERS WERE AT LIBERTY TO WORK AT THEIR TRADES PROVIDED THEY WERE NOT DANGEROUS
LJ003-0155 TAILORING AND SHOEMAKING WAS PERMITTED BUT IT WAS DEEMED UNSAFE TO ALLOW A CARPENTER OR BLACKSMITH TO HAVE HIS TOOLS
LJ003-0156 ALL THE MONEY EARNED BY PRISONERS WAS AT THEIR OWN DISPOSAL AND WAS SPENT ALMOST HABITUALLY IN DRINK CHAMBERING AND WANTONNESS
LJ003-0157 THE BEST ACCOMMODATION THE JAIL COULD OFFER WAS RESERVED FOR THE PRISONERS ON THE STATE SIDE
LJ003-0158 FROM WHOM STILL HIGHER FEES WERE EXACTED WITH THE SAME DISCREDITABLE IDEA OF SWELLING THE REVENUES OF THE PRISON
LJ003-0159 TO CONSTITUTE THIS THE ARISTOCRATIC QUARTER UNWARRANTABLE DEMANDS WERE MADE UPON THE SPACE PROPERLY ALLOTTED TO THE FEMALE FELONS
LJ003-0160 AND NO LODGER WAS REJECTED WHATEVER HIS STATUS WHO OFFERED HIMSELF AND COULD BRING GRIST TO THE MILL
LJ003-0161 THE LUXURY OF THE STATE SIDE WAS FOR A LONG TIME OPEN TO ALL WHO COULD PAY
LJ003-0162 THE CONVICTED FELON THE TRANSPORT AWAITING REMOVAL THE LUNATIC WHOSE CASE WAS STILL UNDECIDED
LJ003-0163 THE MISDEMEANANT TRIED OR UNTRIED THE DEBTOR WHO WISHED TO AVOID THE DISCOMFORT OF THE CROWDED DEBTORS' SIDE THE OUTSPOKEN NEWSPAPER EDITOR
LJ003-0164 OR THE DARING REPORTER OF PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES
LJ003-0165 THE BETTER CLASS OF INMATE COMPLAINED BITTERLY OF THIS ENFORCED COMPANIONSHIP WITH THE VILE
LJ003-0166 ASSOCIATION AT ONE TIME FORBIDDEN BY CUSTOM BUT WHICH GREED AND RAPACITY LONG MADE THE RULE
LJ003-0167 THE FEE FOR ADMISSION TO THE STATE SIDE AS FIXED BY THE TABLE OF FEES WAS THREE GUINEAS BUT MR. NEWMAN DECLARED THAT HE NEVER TOOK MORE THAN TWO
LJ003-0168 TEN AND SIXPENCE A WEEK MORE WAS CHARGED AS RENT FOR A SINGLE BED WHERE TWO OR MORE SLEPT IN A BED THE RENT WAS SEVEN SHILLINGS A WEEK EACH
LJ003-0169 PRISONERS WHO COULD AFFORD IT SOMETIMES PAID FOR FOUR BEDS AT THE RATE OF TWENTYEIGHT SHILLINGS AND SO SECURED THE LUXURY OF A PRIVATE ROOM
LJ003-0170 A MR. LUNDY CHARGED WITH FORGERY WAS THUS ACCOMMODATED ON THE STATE SIDE FOR UPWARDS OF FIVE YEARS
LJ003-0171 BUT THE KEEPER PROTESTED THAT NO SINGLE PRISONER COULD THUS MONOPOLIZE SPACE IF THE STATE SIDE WAS CROWDED
LJ003-0172 THE KEEPER WENT STILL FURTHER IN HIS EFFORTS TO MAKE MONEY
LJ003-0173 HE CONTINUED THE ANCIENT PRACTICE OF LETTING OUT A PORTION OF HIS OWN HOUSE AND BY A POETICAL FICTION TREATED IT AS AN ANNEX OF THE STATE SIDE
LJ003-0174 MR. DAVISON SENT TO NEWGATE FOR EMBEZZLEMENT AND WHOSE CASE IS GIVEN IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER
LJ003-0175 WAS ACCOMMODATED WITH A ROOM IN MR. NEWMAN'S HOUSE AT THE EXTRAVAGANT RENTAL OF THIRTY GUINEAS PER WEEK
LJ003-0176 MR. COBBETT WAS ALSO A LODGER OF MR. NEWMAN'S AND SO WERE ANY MEMBERS OF THE ARISTOCRACY
LJ003-0177 IF THEY HAPPENED TO BE IN FUNDS  AMONG WHOM WAS THE MARQUIS OF SLIGO IN EIGHTEEN ELEVEN
LJ003-0178 THE FEMALE FELONS' WARDS I SHALL DESCRIBE AT LENGTH IN THE NEXT CHAPTER
LJ003-0179 WHICH WILL DEAL WITH MRS. FRY'S PHILANTHROPIC EXERTIONS AT THIS PERIOD IN THIS PARTICULAR PART OF THE PRISON
LJ003-0180 THESE WARDS WERE ALWAYS FULL TO OVERFLOWING SOMETIMES DOUBLE THE NUMBER THE ROOMS COULD ACCOMMODATE WERE CROWDED INTO THEM
LJ003-0181 THERE WAS A MASTER'S SIDE FOR FEMALES WHO COULD PAY THE USUAL FEES BUT THEY ASSOCIATED WITH THE REST IN THE ONE NARROW YARD COMMON TO ALL
LJ003-0182 THE TRIED AND THE UNTRIED YOUNG AND OLD WERE HERDED TOGETHER
LJ003-0183 SOMETIMES GIRLS OF THIRTEEN TWELVE EVEN TEN OR NINE YEARS OF AGE WERE EXPOSED TO QUOTE
LJ003-0184 ALL THE CONTAGION AND PROFLIGACY WHICH PREVAILED IN THIS PART OF THE PRISON END QUOTE
LJ003-0185 THERE WAS NO SEPARATION EVEN FOR THE WOMEN UNDER SENTENCE OF DEATH WHO LIVED IN A COMMON AND PERPETUALLY CROWDED WARD
LJ003-0186 ONLY WHEN THE ORDER OF EXECUTION CAME DOWN WERE THOSE ABOUT TO SUFFER PLACED APART IN ONE OF THE ROOMS IN THE ARCADE OF THE MIDDLE WARD
LJ003-0187 I HAVE KEPT TILL THE LAST THAT PART OF THE PRISON WHICH WAS USUALLY THE LAST RESTINGPLACE OF SO MANY
LJ003-0188 THE OLD PRESS YARD HAS BEEN FULLY DESCRIBED IN A PREVIOUS CHAPTER
LJ003-0189 THE NAME STILL SURVIVED IN THE NEW PRESS YARD WHICH WAS THE RECEPTACLE OF THE MALE CONDEMNED PRISONERS. IT WAS GENERALLY CROWDED LIKE THE REST OF THE PRISON
LJ003-0190 EXCEPT IN MURDER CASES WHERE THE EXECUTION WAS GENERALLY VERY PROMPTLY PERFORMED
LJ003-0191 STRANGE AND INCONCEIVABLE DELAY OCCURRED IN CARRYING OUT THE EXTREME SENTENCE
LJ003-0192 HENCE THERE WAS A TERRIBLE ACCUMULATION OF PRISONERS IN THE CONDEMNED CELLS
LJ003-0193 ONCE DURING THE LONG ILLNESS OF GEORGE III. AS MANY AS ONE HUNDRED WERE THERE WAITING THE REPORT AS IT WAS CALLED
LJ003-0194 AT ANOTHER TIME THERE WERE FIFTY ONE OF WHOM HAD BEEN UNDER SENTENCE A COUPLE OF YEARS
LJ003-0195 MR. BENNET SPEAKS OF THIRTYEIGHT CAPITAL CONVICTS HE FOUND IN THE PRESS YARD IN FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN SEVENTEEN
LJ003-0196 FIVE OF WHOM HAD BEEN CONDEMNED THE PREVIOUS JULY FOUR IN SEPTEMBER AND TWENTYNINE IN OCTOBER
LJ003-0197 THIS PROCRASTINATION BRED CERTAIN CALLOUSNESS
LJ003-0198 FEW REALIZING THAT THE DREADFUL FATE WOULD OVERTAKE THEM DISMISSED THE PROSPECT OF DEATH
LJ003-0199 AND UNTIL THE DAY WAS ACTUALLY FIXED SPENT THE TIME IN ROISTERING SWEARING GAMBLING OR PLAYING AT BALL
LJ003-0200 VISITORS WERE PERMITTED ACCESS TO THEM WITHOUT STINT
LJ003-0201 UNLIMITED DRINK WAS NOT DENIED THEM PROVIDED IT WAS OBTAINED IN REGULATED QUANTITIES AT ONE TIME
LJ003-0202 THESE CAPITAL CONVICTS SAYS MR. BENNET QUOTE LESSENED THE ENNUI AND DESPAIR OF THEIR SITUATION BY UNBECOMING MERRIMENT
LJ003-0203 OR SOUGHT RELIEF IN THE CONSTANT APPLICATION OF INTOXICATING STIMULANTS
LJ003-0204 I SAW CASHMAN A FEW HOURS BEFORE HIS EXECUTION SMOKING AND DRINKING WITH THE UTMOST UNCONCERN AND INDIFFERENCE END QUOTE
LJ003-0205 THOSE WHO WERE THUS RECKLESS REACTED UPON THE PENITENT WHO KNEW THEIR DAYS WERE NUMBERED
LJ003-0206 AND THEIR GIBES AND JOLLITY COUNTERACTED THE ORDINARY'S COUNSELS OR THE INDEPENDENT PREACHER'S EARNEST PRAYERS
LJ003-0207 FOR WHILE ROMAN CATHOLICS AND DISSENTERS WERE ENCOURAGED TO SEE MINISTERS OF THEIR OWN PERSUASION
LJ003-0208 A NUMBER OF AMATEURS WERE EVER READY TO GIVE THEIR GRATUITOUS MINISTRATIONS TO THE CONDEMNED
LJ003-0209 THE PRISONERS IN THE PRESS YARD HAD FREE ACCESS DURING THE DAY TO THE YARD AND LARGE DAY ROOM
LJ003-0210 AT NIGHT THEY WERE PLACED IN THE FIFTEEN CELLS TWO THREE OR MORE TOGETHER ACCORDING TO THE TOTAL NUMBER TO BE ACCOMMODATED
LJ003-0211 THEY WERE NEVER LEFT QUITE ALONE FOR FEAR OF SUICIDE AND FOR THE SAME REASON THEY WERE SEARCHED FOR WEAPONS OR POISONS
LJ003-0212 BUT THEY NEVERTHELESS FREQUENTLY MANAGED TO SECRETE THE MEANS OF MAKING AWAY WITH THEMSELVES AND ACCOMPLISHED THEIR PURPOSE
LJ003-0213 CONVICTED MURDERERS WERE KEPT CONTINUOUSLY IN THE CELLS ON BREAD AND WATER
LJ003-0214 IN COUPLES FROM THE TIME OF SENTENCE TO THAT OF EXECUTION WHICH WAS ABOUT THREE OR FOUR DAYS GENERALLY
LJ003-0215 FROM FRIDAY TO MONDAY SO AS TO INCLUDE ONE SUNDAY ON WHICH DAY THERE WAS A SPECIAL SERVICE FOR THE CONDEMNED IN THE PRISON CHAPEL
LJ003-0216 THIS LATTER WAS AN ORDEAL WHICH ALL DREADED AND MANY AVOIDED BY DENYING THEIR FAITH
LJ003-0217 THE CONDEMNED OCCUPIED AN OPEN PEW IN THE CENTER OF THE CHAPEL HUNG WITH BLACK IN FRONT OF THEM UPON A TABLE WAS A BLACK COFFIN IN FULL VIEW
LJ003-0218 THE CHAPEL WAS FILLED WITH A CURIOUS BUT CALLOUS CONGREGATION WHO CAME TO STARE AT THE MISERABLE PEOPLE THUS PUBLICLY EXPOSED
LJ003-0219 WELL MIGHT MR. BENNET WRITE THAT THE CONDITION OF THE CONDEMNED SIDE WAS THE MOST PROMINENT OF THE MANIFOLD EVILS IN THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF NEWGATE
LJ003-0220 QUOTE SO DISCREDITABLE TO THE METROPOLIS END QUOTE
LJ003-0221 YET IT MUST HAVE BEEN ABUNDANTLY PLAIN TO THE READER THAT THE OTHER EVILS EXISTING WERE GREAT AND GLARING. A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THEM WILL BEST PROVE THIS
LJ003-0222 THE JAIL WAS NEITHER SUITABLE NOR SUFFICIENTLY LARGE IT WAS NOT EVEN KEPT WEATHERTIGHT
LJ003-0223 THE ROOF OF THE FEMALE PRISON SAYS THE GRAND JURY IN THEIR PRESENTMENT IN EIGHTEEN THIRTEEN LET IN THE RAIN
LJ003-0224 SUPPLIES OF COMMON NECESSARIES SUCH AS HAVE NOW BEEN PART OF THE FURNITURE OF EVERY BRITISH JAIL FOR MANY YEARS
LJ003-0225 WERE MEAGER OR ALTOGETHER ABSENT
LJ003-0226 THE RATIONS OF FOOD WERE NOTORIOUSLY INADEQUATE AND SO CARELESSLY DISTRIBUTED THAT MANY WERE LEFT TO STARVE
LJ003-0227 SO UNJUST AND UNEQUAL WAS THE SYSTEM THAT THE ALLOWANCE TO CONVICTED CRIMINALS WAS BETTER THAN THAT OF THE INNOCENT DEBTOR
LJ003-0228 AND THE GENERAL INSUFFICIENCY WAS SUCH
LJ003-0229 THAT IT MULTIPLIED BEYOND ALL REASON THE NUMBER OF VISITORS MANY OF WHOM CAME MERELY AS THE PURVEYORS OF FOOD TO THEIR FRIENDS
LJ003-0230 THE PRISON ALLOWANCES WERE EKED OUT BY THE BROKEN VICTUALS GENEROUSLY GIVEN BY SEVERAL EATINGHOUSE KEEPERS IN THE CITY
LJ003-0231 SUCH AS MESSRS. BIRCH OF CORNHILL AND MESSRS LEACH AND DOLLIMORE OF LUDGATE HILL
LJ003-0232 THESE WERE FETCHED AWAY IN A LARGE TUB ON A TRUCK BY A TURNKEY
LJ003-0233 AMONGST THE HEAP WAS OFTEN THE MEAT THAT HAD MADE TURTLE SOUP WHICH WHEN HEATED AND STIRRED TOGETHER IN A SAUCEPAN WAS SAID TO BE VERY GOOD EATING
LJ003-0234 THE BEDDING WAS SCANTY FUEL AND LIGHT HAD TO BE PURCHASED OUT OF PRISONERS' PRIVATE MEANS CLOTHING WAS ISSUED BUT RARELY
LJ003-0235 EVEN TO PRISONERS ALMOST IN NAKEDNESS AND AS A SPECIAL CHARITABLE GIFT EXTORTION WAS PRACTICED RIGHT AND LEFT
LJ003-0236 GARNISH CONTINUED TO BE DEMANDED LONG AFTER IT HAD DISAPPEARED IN OTHER AND BETTERREGULATED PRISONS
LJ003-0237 THE FEES ON RECEPTION AND DISCHARGE MUST BE DEEMED EXORBITANT WHEN IT IS REMEMBERED THE IMPOVERISHED CLASS WHO USUALLY CROWDED THE JAIL
LJ003-0238 AND THEY WERE EXACTED TO RELIEVE A RICH CORPORATION FROM PAYING FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF THEIR OWN PRISON
LJ003-0239 THIS IMPOSITION OF FEES LEFT PRISONERS DESTITUTE ON THEIR DISCHARGE WITHOUT FUNDS TO SUPPORT THEM IN THEIR FIRST STRUGGLE TO RECOMMENCE LIFE
LJ003-0240 WITH RUINED CHARACTER BAD HABITS AND OFTEN BAD HEALTH CONTRACTED IN THE JAIL
LJ003-0241 A FURTHER AND A MORE INIQUITOUS METHOD OF EXTORTING MONEY
LJ003-0242 WAS STILL PRACTICED THAT OF LOADING NEWLYARRIVED PRISONERS UNTIL THEY PAID CERTAIN FEES
LJ003-0243 IRONING WAS STILL THE RULE NOT ONLY FOR THE CONVICTED BUT FOR THOSE CHARGED WITH FELONIES ONLY THE MISDEMEANANTS ESCAPED
LJ003-0244 AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF EVERY SESSIONS SUCH OF THE UNTRIED AS HAD PURCHASED EASEMENT OF IRONS WERE CALLED UP AND REFETTERED
LJ003-0245 PREPARATORY TO THEIR APPEARANCE IN THE OLD BAILEY. IRONS WERE SELDOM REMOVED FROM THE CONVICTED UNTIL DISCHARGE
LJ003-0246 SOMETIMES THE WEARER WAS DECLARED MEDICALLY UNFIT OR HE OBTAINED RELEASE BY LONG GOOD CONDUCT
LJ003-0247 OR THE FAITHFUL DISCHARGE OF SOME PETTY OFFICE SUCH AS GATESMAN OR CAPTAIN OF A WARD
LJ003-0248 THE IRONS WEIGHED FROM THREE TO FOUR POUNDS BUT HEAVIER IRONS SEVEN OR EIGHT POUNDS' WEIGHT
LJ003-0249 WERE IMPOSED IN CASE OF MISCONDUCT AND WHEN THERE HAD BEEN AN ATTEMPT AT ESCAPE
LJ003-0250 THE CULPRIT WAS CHAINED DOWN TO THE FLOOR BY RUNNING A CHAIN THROUGH HIS IRONS WHICH PREVENTED HIM FROM CLIMBING TO THE WINDOW OF HIS CELL
LJ003-0251 AMONG OTHER EXCUSES OFFERED FOR THUS MANACLING ALL ALMOST WITHOUT EXCEPTION WAS THAT IT WAS THE BEST AND SAFEST METHOD
LJ003-0252 OF DISTINGUISHING A PRISONER FROM A STRANGER AND TEMPORARY VISITOR
LJ003-0253 CLOTHES OR PRISON UNIFORM WOULD NOT HAVE SERVED THE PURPOSE FOR A DISGUISE CAN BE RAPIDLY AND SECRETLY PUT ON
LJ003-0254 WHEREAS IRONS CANNOT WELL BE EXCHANGED WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME AND ATTRACTING MUCH ATTENTION
LJ003-0255 THE UNCHECKED ADMISSION OF CROWDS OF VISITORS TO THE FELONS' AS WELL AS THE DEBTORS' SIDE WAS ANOTHER UNMIXED EVIL
LJ003-0256 BY THIS MEANS SPIRITS OTHERWISE UNATTAINABLE AND STRICTLY PROHIBITED WERE SMUGGLED INTO THE JAIL
LJ003-0257 SEARCHES WERE MADE CERTAINLY BUT THEY WERE TOO OFTEN SUPERFICIAL OR THEY MIGHT BE EVADED BY A TRIFLING BRIBE
LJ003-0258 HENCE THE FREQUENT CASES OF DRUNKENNESS OF WHICH NO NOTICE WAS TAKEN UNLESS PEOPLE GREW RIOTOUS IN THEIR CUPS
LJ003-0259 AND ATTRACTED ATTENTION BY THEIR DISORDERLY BEHAVIOR
LJ003-0260 ANOTHER FRIGHTFUL CONSEQUENCE OF THIS INDISCRIMINATE ADMISSION WAS THE INFLUX OF NUMBERS OF ABANDONED WOMEN
LJ003-0261 ONLY A FEW OF WHOM HAD THE COMMENDABLE PRUDERY TO PASS THEMSELVES OFF AS THE WIVES OF PRISONERS
LJ003-0262 ANY REPUTED AND INDEED ANY REAL WIFE MIGHT SPEND THE NIGHT IN NEWGATE IF SHE WOULD PAY THE SHILLING FEE COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE BAD MONEY
LJ003-0263 WHICH MIGHT HAVE DONE SOMETHING TOWARDS INCREASING THE PRISON RECEIPTS HAD IT NOT BEEN APPROPRIATED BY THE TURNKEY WHO WINKED AT THIS EVASION OF THE RULES
LJ003-0264 AMONG THE DAILY VISITORS WERE MEMBERS OF THE CRIMINAL CLASSES STILL AT LARGE
LJ003-0265 THE THIEVES AND BURGLARS WHO CARRIED ON THE ACTIVE BUSINESS OF THEIR PROFESSION FROM WHICH THEIR CONFEDERATES WERE TEMPORARILY DEBARRED
LJ003-0266 ONE NOTORIOUS CHARACTER WHILE A PRISONER AWAITING TRANSFER TO THE HULKS
LJ003-0267 KEPT OPEN HOUSE SO TO SPEAK AND ENTERTAINED DAILY WITHIN THE WALLS A SELECT PARTY OF THE MOST NOTED THIEVES IN LONDON
LJ003-0268 THIS DELECTABLE SOCIETY ENTICED INTO THEIR SET A CLERK WHO HAD BEEN IMPRISONED FOR FRAUD
LJ003-0269 AND OFFERED HIM HALF THE BOOTY IF HE WOULD GIVE FULL INFORMATION AS TO THE TRANSACTIONS AND CORRESPONDENCE OF HIS LATE EMPLOYERS
LJ003-0270 OWING TO THE FACILITY OF INTERCOURSE BETWEEN INSIDE AND OUTSIDE MANY CRIMES WERE DOUBTLESS HATCHED IN NEWGATE
LJ003-0271 SOME OF THE WORST AND MOST EXTENSIVE BURGLARIES WERE PLANNED THERE
LJ003-0273 I BELIEVE SAYS MR. BENNET IN THE LETTER ALREADY LARGELY QUOTED
LJ003-0274 THAT THERE IS NO PLACE IN THE METROPOLIS WHERE MORE CRIMES ARE PROJECTED OR WHERE STOLEN PROPERTY IS MORE SECRETED THAN IN NEWGATE
LJ003-0275 THESE MALPRACTICES WERE FOSTERED BY THE ABSENCE OF ALL SUPERVISION AND THE GENERALLY UNBROKEN IDLENESS
LJ003-0276 ALTHOUGH ATTEMPTED PARTIALLY AT BRIDEWELL AND MORE SYSTEMATICALLY AT THE NEW MILLBANK PENITENTIARY
LJ003-0277 BUT JUST OPEN 1816 THE REGULAR EMPLOYMENT OF PRISONERS HAD NEVER YET BEEN ACCEPTED AS A PRINCIPLE IN THE METROPOLITAN PRISONS
LJ003-0278 INSUPERABLE DIFFICULTIES WERE STILL SUPPOSED TO STAND IN THE WAY OF ANY GENERAL EMPLOYMENT OF PRISONERS AT THEIR TRADES
LJ003-0279 THERE WAS FEAR AS TO THE UNRESTRICTED USE OF TOOLS
LJ003-0280 LIMITS OF SPACE THE INTERFERENCE OF THE ILLDISPOSED WHO WOULD NEITHER WORK NOR LET OTHERS DO SO
LJ003-0281 AND THE DANGER OF LOSING MATERIAL RAW OR MANUFACTURED
LJ003-0282 MANY YEARS WERE TO ELAPSE BEFORE THESE OBJECTIONS SHOULD BE FAIRLY MET AND UNIVERSALLY OVERCOME
LJ003-0283 IT WAS NOT STRANGE THEREFORE THAT THE INMATES OF NEWGATE SHOULD TURN THEIR UNOCCUPIED BRAINS AND IDLE HANDS TO ALL MANNER OF MISCHIEF
LJ003-0284 THAT WHEN THEY WERE NOT CAROUSING PLOTTING OR SCHEMING
LJ003-0285 THEY SHOULD GAMBLE WITH DICE OR CARDS AND PLAY AT BUMBLE PUPPY OR SOME OTHER DISREPUTABLE GAME OF CHANCE
LJ003-0286 THE REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS PAINTED SO BLACK A PICTURE OF NEWGATE AS THEN CONDUCTED THAT THE CORPORATION WERE ROUSED IN VERY SHAME
LJ003-0287 TO UNDERTAKE SOME KIND OF REFORM
LJ003-0288 THE ABOVEMENTIONED REPORT WAS ORDERED TO BE PRINTED UPON THE 9TH MAY
LJ003-0289 UPON THE 29TH JULY THE SAME YEAR
LJ003-0290 THE COURT OF ALDERMEN APPOINTED A COMMITTEE OF ITS OWN BODY ASSISTED BY THE TOWN CLERK MR. DANCE CITY SURVEYOR SON TO THE ARCHITECT OF NEWGATE
LJ003-0291 AND MR. ADDISON KEEPER OF NEWGATE TO MAKE A VISITATION OF THE JAILS SUPPOSED TO BE THE BEST MANAGED INCLUDING THOSE OF PETWORTH AND GLOUCESTER
LJ003-0292 THIS COMMITTEE WAS TO COMPARE ALLOWANCES EXAMINE RULES AND CERTIFY AS TO THE CONDITION OF PRISONERS
LJ003-0293 ALSO TO MAKE SUCH PROPOSALS AS MIGHT APPEAR SALUTARY AND CALCULATED TO IMPROVE NEWGATE AND THE REST OF THE CITY JAILS
LJ003-0294 THIS COMMITTEE MADE ITS REPORT IN SEPTEMBER THE FOLLOWING YEAR AND AN EXCELLENT REPORT IT IS SO FAR AS ITS RECOMMENDATIONS ARE CONCERNED
LJ003-0295 THE COMMITTEE SEEMS TO HAVE FULLY REALIZED EVEN AT THIS EARLY DATE EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN
LJ003-0296 MANY OF THE INDISPENSABLE CONDITIONS OF A MODEL PRISON ACCORDING TO MODERN IDEAS
LJ003-0297 IT ADMITTED THE PARAMOUNT NECESSITY
LJ003-0298 FOR GIVING EVERY PRISONER A SLEEPING CELL TO HIMSELF AN AMOUNT OF ENLIGHTENMENT WHICH IS HARDLY GENERAL AMONG EUROPEAN NATIONS AT THIS
LJ003-0299 THE LATTER END OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY SEVERAL OF WHICH STILL FALL FAR SHORT OF OUR ENGLISH IDEAL
LJ003-0300 THAT ALL PRISONERS SHOULD ALWAYS BE IN SEPARATE CELLS BY NIGHT AND THOSE OF SHORT SENTENCES BY DAY
LJ003-0301 IT RECOMMENDED DAY CELLS OR ROOMS FOR REGULAR LABOR WHICH SHOULD BE COMPULSORY UPON ALL TRANSPORTS AND PRISONERS SENTENCED TO HARD LABOR
LJ003-0302 THE WORK BEING CONSTANT AND SUITABLE WITH CERTAIN HOURS OF RELAXATION AND FOR FOOD AND EXERCISE
LJ003-0303 THE PERSONAL CLEANLINESS OF ALL PRISONERS WAS TO BE INSISTED UPON THEY SHOULD BE MADE TO WASH AT LEAST ONCE A DAY
LJ003-0304 WITH THE PENALTY OF FORFEITING THE DAY'S ALLOWANCE OF FOOD AN INCREASE OF WHICH THE COMMITTEE HAD RECOMMENDED
LJ003-0305 THE PROVISION OF MORE BATHS WAS ALSO SUGGESTED AND THE DAILY SWEEPING OUT OF THE PRISON
LJ003-0306 THE CLOTHES OF PRISONERS ARRIVING DIRTY OR IN RAGS SHOULD BE FUMIGATED BEFORE WORN IN THE JAIL
LJ003-0307 BUT AS YET NO SUGGESTION WAS MADE TO PROVIDE PRISON UNIFORM
LJ003-0308 A LAUNDRY SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED AND A MATRON APPOINTED ON THE FEMALE SIDE WHERE ALL THE PRISONERS' WASHING COULD BE PERFORMED
LJ003-0309 PROPER HOURS FOR LOCKING AND UNLOCKING PRISONERS SHOULD BE INSISTED UPON
LJ003-0310 A BELL SHOULD GIVE NOTICE THEREOF AND OF MEALHOURS WORKINGHOURS OR OF ESCAPES
LJ003-0311 THE COMMITTEE TOOK UPON ITSELF TO LAY DOWN STRINGENT RULES FOR THE DISCIPLINE OF THE PRISON
LJ003-0312 THE JAILER SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO VISIT EVERY PART AND SEE EVERY PRISONER DAILY THE CHAPLAIN SHOULD PERFORM SERVICE VISIT THE SICK
LJ003-0313 INSTRUCT THE PRISONERS QUOTE GIVE SPIRITUAL ADVICE AND ADMINISTER RELIGIOUS CONSOLATION END QUOTE. TO ALL WHO MIGHT NEED THEM
LJ003-0314 THE SURGEON SHOULD SEE ALL PRISONERS WHETHER ILL OR WELL ONCE A WEEK AND TAKE GENERAL CHARGE OF THE INFIRMARIES
LJ003-0315 ALL THREE GOVERNOR CHAPLAIN AND SURGEON SHOULD KEEP JOURNALS WHICH SHOULD BE INSPECTED PERIODICALLY BY THE VISITING MAGISTRATES
LJ003-0316 IT SHOULD BE PEREMPTORILY FORBIDDEN TO THE KEEPER OR ANY OFFICER TO MAKE A PECUNIARY PROFIT OUT OF THE SUPPLIES OF FOOD FUEL OR OTHER NECESSARIES
LJ003-0317 NO PRISONER SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO OBTAIN SUPERIOR ACCOMMODATION ON THE PAYMENT OF ANY FEES. FEES INDEED SHOULD BE GENERALLY ABOLISHED GARNISH ALSO
LJ003-0318 NO PRISONERS SHOULD IN FUTURE BE IRONED EXCEPT IN CASES OF MISCONDUCT
LJ003-0319 PROVIDED ONLY THAT THEIR SECURITY WAS NOT JEOPARDIZED AND DEPENDENT UPON THE ENFORCEMENT OF ANOTHER NEW RULE
LJ003-0320 WHICH RECOMMENDED RESTRICTIONS UPON THE NUMBER OF VISITORS ADMITTED
LJ003-0321 NO WINE OR BEER SHOULD BE IN FUTURE ADMITTED INTO OR SOLD IN THE JAIL
LJ003-0322 EXCEPT FOR THE USE OF THE DEBTORS OR AS MEDICAL COMFORTS FOR THE INFIRMARY
LJ003-0323 DRUNKENNESS IF IT EVER OCCURRED SHOULD BE VISITED WITH SEVERE PUNISHMENT
LJ003-0324 GAMING OF ALL SORTS SHOULD BE PEREMPTORILY FORBIDDEN UNDER HEAVY PAINS AND PENALTIES
LJ003-0325 THE FEELINGS OF THE CONDEMNED PRISONERS SHOULD NO LONGER BE OUTRAGED BY THEIR EXPOSURE IN THE CHAPEL AND THE CHAPEL SHOULD BE REARRANGED
LJ003-0326 SO THAT THE VARIOUS CLASSES MIGHT BE SEATED SEPARATELY AND SO AS NOT TO SEE EACH OTHER
LJ003-0327 IT WILL HARDLY BE DENIED THAT THESE PROPOSALS WENT TO THE ROOT OF THE MATTER
LJ003-0328 HAD THEY BEEN ACCEPTED IN THEIR ENTIRETY LITTLE FAULT COULD IN FUTURE HAVE BEEN FOUND WITH THE MANAGERS OF NEWGATE
LJ003-0329 IN COMMON JUSTICE TO THEM IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT IMMEDIATE EFFECT WAS GIVEN TO ALL THAT COULD BE EASILY CARRIED OUT
LJ003-0330 THE STATE SIDE CEASED TO EXIST AND THE FEMALE PRISONERS THUS REGAINED THE SPACE OF WHICH THEIR QUADRANGLE HAD BEEN ROBBED
LJ003-0331 THE PRIVILEGES OF THE MASTER'S SIDE ALSO DISAPPEARED FEES WERE NOMINALLY ABOLISHED AND GARNISH WAS SCOTCHED ALTHOUGH NOT YET KILLED OUTRIGHT
LJ003-0332 A CERTAIN NUMBER OF BEDSTEADS WERE PROVIDED AND THERE WAS A SLIGHT INCREASE IN THE RATION OF BREAD
LJ003-0333 BUT HERE THE RECOMMENDATIONS TOUCHED AT ONCE UPON THE DELICATE SUBJECT OF EXPENSE AND IT IS CLEAR THAT THE COMMITTEE HESITATED ON THIS SCORE
LJ003-0334 IT MADE THIS TOO THE EXCUSE FOR BEGGING THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE OF THE WHOLE QUESTION
LJ003-0335 THE COMMITTEE DID NOT DENY THE SUPERIOR ADVANTAGES OFFERED BY SUCH PRISONS AS GLOUCESTER AND PETWORTH
LJ003-0336 BUT IT AT ONCE DEPRECATED THE IDEA THAT THE CITY COULD FOLLOW THE LAUDABLE EXAMPLE THUS SET IN THE PROVINCES. QUOTE
LJ003-0337 WERE A METROPOLITAN PRISON ERECTED ON THE SAME LINES WITH ALL THE SPACE NOT ONLY FOR AIR AND EXERCISE BUT FOR DAY ROOMS AND SLEEPING CELLS
LJ003-0338 END QUOTE. IT WOULD COVER SOME THIRTY ACRES AND COST A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN THE CITY WITH THE EXAMPLE OF WHITECROSS STREET PRISON BEFORE IT
LJ003-0339 COULD POSSIBLY AFFORD
LJ003-0340 THE COMMITTEE DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE YET UNDERSTOOD THAT NEWGATE COULD BE ONLY AND PROPERLY REPLACED
LJ003-0341 BY A NEW JAIL BUILT ON THE OUTSKIRTS AS HOLLOWAY EVENTUALLY WAS AND PERMITTED ITSELF TO BE ALTOGETHER COUNTERED
LJ003-0342 AND CHECKED IN ITS EFFORTS TOWARDS REFORM BY THE PROHIBITORY COSTLINESS OF THE LAND ABOUT NEWGATE
LJ003-0343 WITH THE SEEMING IMPOSSIBILITY OF EXTENDING THE LIMITS OF THE PRISON AS IT THEN STOOD
LJ003-0344 ALL CHANCES OF CLASSIFICATION AND SEPARATION VANISHED AND THE GREATEST EVILS REMAINED UNTOUCHED
LJ003-0345 ALL THE COMMITTEE COULD DO IN THIS RESPECT WAS TO THROW THE RESPONSIBILITY ON OTHERS
LJ003-0346 IT POINTED OUT THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS TO BLAME FOR THE OVERCROWDING AND MIGHT DIMINISH IT IF IT CHOSE
LJ003-0347 IT WAS VERY DESIRABLE THAT THERE SHOULD BE A MORE SPEEDY REMOVAL OF TRANSPORTS FROM NEWGATE TO THE SHIPS
LJ003-0348 AGAIN THERE WAS THE NEW MILLBANK PENITENTIARY NOW READY FOR OCCUPATION
LJ003-0349 WHY NOT RELIEVE NEWGATE BY DRAWING MORE LARGELY UPON THE SUPERIOR ACCOMMODATION WHICH MILLBANK OFFERED
LJ004-0001 THE CHRONICLES OF NEWGATE VOLUME 2. BY ARTHUR GRIFFITHS. SECTION 7 THE BEGINNINGS OF PRISON REFORM
LJ004-0002 WHILE MRS. FRY WAS DILIGENTLY ENGAGED UPON HER SELFIMPOSED TASK IN NEWGATE
LJ004-0003 OTHER EARNEST PEOPLE INSPIRED DOUBTLESS BY HER NOBLE EXAMPLE WERE STIRRED UP TO ACTIVITY IN THE SAME GREAT WORK
LJ004-0004 IT BEGAN TO BE UNDERSTOOD THAT PRISON REFORM COULD ONLY BE COMPASSED BY CONTINUOUS AND COMBINED EFFORT
LJ004-0005 THE PLEADINGS HOWEVER ELOQUENT OF A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL WERE UNABLE TO MORE THAN PARTIALLY REMEDY THE WIDESPREAD AND COLOSSAL EVILS OF BRITISH PRISONS
LJ004-0006 HOWARD'S ENERGY AND DEVOTION WERE REWARDED BY LIVELY SYMPATHY BUT THE DESIRE TO IMPROVE WHICH FOLLOWED HIS EXPOSURES WAS BUT SHORTLIVED
LJ004-0007 IT WAS SO POWERLESS AGAINST THE PERSISTENT NEGLECT OF THOSE INTRUSTED WITH PRISON MANAGEMENT THAT FIVEANDTWENTY YEARS LATER
LJ004-0008 MR. NEILD A SECOND HOWARD
LJ004-0009 AS INDEFATIGABLE AND SELFSACRIFICING FOUND BY PERSONAL VISITATION THAT THE CONDITION OF JAILS THROUGHOUT THE KINGDOM WAS
LJ004-0010 WITH A FEW BRIGHT EXCEPTIONS STILL DEPLORABLE AND DISGRACEFUL
LJ004-0011 MR. NEILD WAS COMPELLED TO ADMIT IN EIGHTEEN TWELVE THAT THE GREAT REFORMATION PRODUCED BY HOWARD
LJ004-0012 WAS IN SEVERAL PLACES MERELY TEMPORARY
LJ004-0013 SOME PRISONS THAT HAD BEEN AMELIORATED UNDER THE PERSUASIVE INFLUENCE OF HIS KIND ADVICE WERE RELAPSING INTO THEIR FORMER HORRID STATE OF PRIVATION
LJ004-0014 FILTHINESS SEVERITY OR NEGLECT MANY NEW DUNGEONS HAD AGGRAVATED THE EVILS AGAINST WHICH HIS SAGACITY COULD NOT BUT REMONSTRATE
LJ004-0015 THE MOTIVES FOR A TRANSIENT AMENDMENT WERE BECOMING PARALYZED AND THE EFFECT HAD CEASED WITH THE CAUSE
LJ004-0016 I HAVE SHOWN IN A PREVIOUS CHAPTER WHAT NEWGATE WAS AT THIS PERIOD DESPITE A VAST EXPENDITURE AND BOASTED EFFORTS TO INTRODUCE REFORMS
LJ004-0017 SOME OF THE COUNTY JAILS AND ONE OR TWO BOROUGH JAILS HAD BEEN REBUILT
LJ004-0018 GENERALLY THROUGH THE PERSONAL ACTIVITY OF INFLUENTIAL AND BENEVOLENT LOCAL MAGNATES BUT THE TRUE PRINCIPLES OF PRISON CONSTRUCTION
LJ004-0019 WERE AS YET BUT IMPERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD AND SUCH PORTIONS OF THE IMPROVED JAILS OF THAT PERIOD AS WERE STILL EXTANT A FEW YEARS BACK
LJ004-0020 CONTRAST LUDICROUSLY WITH THE PRISON ARCHITECTURE BASED UPON A CENTURY'S EXPERIENCE OF OUR OWN AGE
LJ004-0021 THE NEGLECT OF PRISON REFORM IN THOSE DAYS WAS NOT TO BE VISITED UPON THE LEGISLATURE
LJ004-0022 THE EXECUTIVE ALTHOUGH HARASSED BY INTERNAL COMMOTION AND FOREIGN WAR WAS NOT ENTIRELY CALLOUS TO THE CRYING NEED FOR AMELIORATION IN JAILS
LJ004-0023 MEASURES REMEDIAL ALTHOUGH AT BEST PARTIAL AND INCOMPLETE WERE INTRODUCED FROM TIME TO TIME
LJ004-0024 THUS IN EIGHTEEN THIRTEEN THE EXACTION OF JAIL FEES HAD BEEN FORBIDDEN BY LAW
LJ004-0025 AND TWO OTHER ACTS MORE PEREMPTORY AND PRECISE FOLLOWED ON THE SAME SUBJECT IN SUCCEEDING YEARS
LJ004-0026 IN EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN A BILL WAS BROUGHT IN TO INSIST UPON THE APPOINTMENT OF CHAPLAINS IN JAILS AND WHEN THIS HAD PASSED INTO LAW
LJ004-0027 IT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY AMPLIFIED AND THE RATES OF SALARIES FIXED
LJ004-0028 VARIOUS ACTS WERE ALSO PASSED TO CONSOLIDATE AND AMEND PREVIOUS JAIL ACTS
LJ004-0029 THE ERECTION OF NEW PRISON BUILDINGS WAS MADE IMPERATIVE UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS AND FOLLOWING CERTAIN RULES
LJ004-0030 THE PRINCIPLE OF CLASSIFICATION WAS FRESHLY ENUNCIATED PRISON REGULATIONS WERE FRAMED FOR GENERAL OBSERVANCE
LJ004-0031 BUT THE EFFECT OF THIS LEGISLATION WAS RATHER WEAKENED BY THE REMOTENESS OF THE PRESSURE EXERCISED
LJ004-0032 THE ONUS OF IMPROVEMENT LAY UPON THE MAGISTRACY THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES ADMINISTERING LOCAL FUNDS
LJ004-0033 AND THEY WERE NOT THREATENED WITH ANY PARTICULAR PENALTIES IF THEY EVADED OR IGNORED THE NEW ACTS
LJ004-0034 MOREOVER THE LAWS APPLIED MORE PARTICULARLY TO COUNTY JURISDICTIONS
LJ004-0035 THE BOROUGH JAILS THOSE IN FACT UNDER CORPORATE MANAGEMENT WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE NEW MEASURES
LJ004-0036 IT WAS HOPED THAT THEIR RULERS WOULD HIRE ACCOMMODATION IN THE COUNTY PRISONS AND THAT THE INFERIOR ESTABLISHMENTS WOULD IN COURSE OF TIME DISAPPEAR
LJ004-0037 YET THE BOROUGH JAILS WERE DESTINED TO SURVIVE MANY YEARS AND TO EXHIBIT FOR A LONG TIME TO COME ALL THE WORST FEATURES OF JAIL MISMANAGEMENT
LJ004-0038 IT WAS IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTEEN THAT A SMALL BAND OF PHILANTHROPISTS RESOLVED TO FORM THEMSELVES INTO AN ASSOCIATION FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF PRISON DISCIPLINE
LJ004-0039 THEY WERE HOPELESS OF ANY GENERAL REFORM BY THE ACTION OF THE EXECUTIVE ALONE
LJ004-0040 THEY FELT THAT PRIVATE ENTERPRISE MIGHT
LJ004-0041 WITH ADVANTAGE STEP IN AND BY THE COLLECTION AND DIFFUSION OF INFORMATION AND THE REITERATION OF SOUND ADVICE GREATLY ASSIST THE GOOD WORK
LJ004-0042 THE ASSOCIATION WAS ORGANIZED UNDER THE MOST PROMISING AUSPICES
LJ004-0043 A KING'S SON THE DUKE OF GLOUCESTER WAS THE PATRON AMONG THE VICEPRESIDENTS WERE MANY GREAT PEERS OF THE REALM
LJ004-0044 SEVERAL BISHOPS AND A NUMBER OF MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS INCLUDING MR. MANNERS SUTTON
LJ004-0045 MR. STURGES BOURNE SIR JAMES MACKINTOSH SIR JAMES SCARLETT AND WILLIAM WILBERFORCE
LJ004-0046 AN ACTIVE COMMITTEE WAS APPOINTED COMPRISING MANY NAMES ALREADY WELL KNOWN SOME OF THEM DESTINED TO BECOME FAMOUS IN THE ANNALS OF PHILANTHROPY
LJ004-0047 ONE OF THE MOVING SPIRITS WAS THE HONORABLE H. G. BENNET M.P. WHOSE VIGOROUS PROTESTS AGAINST THE LAMENTABLE CONDITION OF NEWGATE HAVE ALREADY BEEN RECORDED
LJ004-0048 MRS. FRY'S BROTHER MR. SAMUEL HOARE JUNIOR WAS CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE ON WHICH ALSO SERVED MANY NOTED MEMBERS OF THE SOCIETY OF FRIENDS
LJ004-0049 MR. GURNEY MR. FRY MESSRS. FORSTER AND MR. T. F. BUXTON THE COADJUTOR OF WILBERFORCE IN THE GREAT ANTISLAVERY STRUGGLE
LJ004-0050 MR. BUXTON HAD ALREADY BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH MRS. FRY IN THE NEWGATE VISITATION AND HIS ATTENTION HAD THUS BEEN DRAWN TO THE NEGLECTED STATE OF ENGLISH PRISONS
LJ004-0051 WHEN IN BELGIUM HE HAD EXAMINED WITH GREAT SATISFACTION THE ADMIRABLE MANAGEMENT OF THE GREAT MAISON DE FORCE AT GHENT
LJ004-0052 WHICH HOWARD HAD EULOGIZED SOME FORTY YEARS BEFORE
LJ004-0054 IN ORDER TO GIVE GREATER VALUE TO THE PAMPHLET
LJ004-0055 HE PERSONALLY VISITED SEVERAL ENGLISH JAILS AND POINTED HIS OBSERVATIONS BY DRAWING FORCIBLE CONTRASTS BETWEEN THE GOOD AND BAD
LJ004-0056 MR. BUXTON'S SMALL WORK ON PRISON DISCIPLINE GAVE A NEW ASPECT TO THE QUESTION HE HAD SO MUCH AT HEART
LJ004-0057 FOR THE FIRST TIME THE DOCTRINE WAS ENUNCIATED THAT PRISONERS HAD RIGHTS OF THEIR OWN
LJ004-0058 THE UNTRIED AND IN THE EYES OF THE LAW STILL INNOCENT COULD CLAIM PURE AIR WHOLESOME AND SUFFICIENT FOOD AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXERCISE
LJ004-0059 THEY HAD A RIGHT MR. BUXTON AFFIRMED TO BE EMPLOYED IN THEIR OWN CRAFTS PROVIDED IT COULD BE SAFELY FOLLOWED IN PRISON
LJ004-0060 YOU HAVE NO RIGHT HE SAYS ADDRESSING THE AUTHORITIES TO SUBJECT A PRISONER TO SUFFERING FROM COLD
LJ004-0061 BY WANT OF BEDCLOTHING BY NIGHT OR FIRING BY DAY
LJ004-0062 AND THE REASON IS PLAIN YOU HAVE TAKEN HIM FROM HIS HOME AND HAVE DEPRIVED HIM OF THE MEANS OF PROVIDING HIMSELF WITH THE NECESSARIES OR COMFORTS OF LIFE
LJ004-0063 AND THEREFORE YOU ARE BOUND TO FURNISH HIM WITH MODERATE INDEED BUT SUITABLE ACCOMMODATION
LJ004-0064 YOU HAVE FOR THE SAME REASON HE GOES ON NO RIGHT TO RUIN HIS HABITS BY COMPELLING HIM TO BE IDLE
LJ004-0065 HIS MORALS BY COMPELLING HIM TO MIX WITH A PROMISCUOUS ASSEMBLAGE OF HARDENED AND CONVICTED CRIMINALS
LJ004-0066 OR HIS HEALTH BY FORCING HIM AT NIGHT INTO A DAMP UNVENTILATED CELL WITH SUCH CROWDS OF COMPANIONS AS VERY SPEEDILY RENDER THE AIR FOUL AND PUTRID
LJ004-0067 OR TO MAKE HIM SLEEP IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE VICTIMS OF CONTAGIOUS AND LOATHSOME DISEASE
LJ004-0068 OR AMIDST THE NOXIOUS EFFLUVIA OF DIRT AND CORRUPTION
LJ004-0069 IN SHORT ATTENTION TO HIS FEELINGS MENTAL AND BODILY A SUPPLY OF EVERY NECESSARY ABSTRACTION FROM EVIL SOCIETY
LJ004-0070 THE CONSERVATION OF HIS HEALTH AND INDUSTRIOUS HABITS ARE THE CLEAR EVIDENT UNDENIABLE RIGHTS OF AN UNCONVICTED PRISONER
LJ004-0071 NOR EVEN WHEN FOUND GUILTY AND HIS LIBERTY FORFEITED DID HIS PRIVILEGES CEASE. THE LAW APPOINTED A SUITABLE PUNISHMENT FOR THE OFFENSE
LJ004-0072 IT WAS FOR THOSE CHARGED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE LAW TO GUARD CAREFULLY AGAINST ANY AGGRAVATION OF THAT PUNISHMENT
LJ004-0073 TO SEE THAT NO CIRCUMSTANCES OF SEVERITY ARE FOUND IN HIS TREATMENT WHICH ARE NOT FOUND IN HIS SENTENCE
LJ004-0074 NO JUDGE EVER CONDEMNED A MAN TO BE HALFPERISHED WITH COLD BY DAY OR HALFSUFFOCATED WITH HEAT BY NIGHT
LJ004-0075 WHO EVER HEARD OF A CRIMINAL BEING SENTENCED TO CATCH THE RHEUMATISM OR THE TYPHUS FEVER
LJ004-0076 DISEASE COLD FAMINE NAKEDNESS AND CONTAGIOUS AND POLLUTED AIR ARE NOT LAWFUL PUNISHMENTS IN THE HANDS OF THE CIVIL MAGISTRATES
LJ004-0077 NOR HAS HE A RIGHT TO POISON OR STARVE HIS FELLOWCREATURES
LJ004-0078 THE CONVICTED DELINQUENT HAS HIS RIGHTS SAID MR. BUXTON AUTHORITATIVELY
LJ004-0079 ALL MEASURES AND PRACTICES IN PRISON WHICH MAY INJURE HIM IN ANY WAY ARE ILLEGAL
LJ004-0080 BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT SPECIFIED IN HIS SENTENCE HE IS THEREFORE ENTITLED TO A WHOLESOME ATMOSPHERE
LJ004-0081 DECENT CLOTHING AND BEDDING AND A DIET SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT HIM
LJ004-0082 THESE SOMEWHAT NOVEL BUT UNDOUBTEDLY INDISPUTABLE PROPOSITIONS WERE BACKED UP NOT BY SOUND ARGUMENTS ONLY BUT BY THE LETTER OF THE LAW
LJ004-0083 AS MR. BUXTON POINTED OUT MANY OLD ACTS OF PARLIAMENT DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE PRISONER WERE STILL IN FULL FORCE
LJ004-0084 SOME MIGHT BE IN ABEYANCE BUT THEY HAD NEVER BEEN REPEALED AND SOME WERE QUITE FRESHLY IMPORTED UPON THE STATUTE BOOK
LJ004-0085 AS FAR BACK AS THE REIGN OF CHARLES II. A LAW WAS PASSED DECLARING THAT SUFFICIENT PROVISION SHOULD BE MADE FOR THE RELIEF AND SETTING ON WORK
LJ004-0086 OF POOR AND NEEDY PRISONERS COMMITTED TO THE COMMON JAIL FOR FELONY AND OTHER MISDEMEANORS WHO MANY TIMES PERISH BEFORE THEIR TRIAL
LJ004-0087 AND THE POOR THERE LIVING IDLE AND UNEMPLOYED BECOME DEBAUCHED AND COME FORTH INSTRUCTED IN THE PRACTICE OF THIEVERY AND LEWDNESS
LJ004-0088 AS A REMEDY JUSTICES OF THE PEACE WERE EMPOWERED TO PROVIDE MATERIALS FOR THE SETTING OF POOR PRISONERS TO WORK
LJ004-0089 AND TO PAY OVERSEERS OR INSTRUCTORS OUT OF THE COUNTY RATES
LJ004-0090 AGAIN THE 22 CHARLES II. C 20 ORDERED THE JAILER TO KEEP FELONS AND DEBTORS SEPARATE AND APART FROM ONE ANOTHER
LJ004-0091 IN DISTINCT ROOMS ON PAIN OF FORFEITING HIS OFFICE AND TREBLE DAMAGES TO THE PARTY AGGRIEVED
LJ004-0092 A MUCH LATER ACT THE FOURTEEN GEORGE III. C. FIFTY NINE SEVENTEEN SEVENTY FOUR
LJ004-0093 WHICH WAS CONTEMPORANEOUS WITH HOWARD'S FIRST JOURNEYS LAID DOWN PRECISE RULES AS REGARDS CLEANLINESS AND THE PROPER SUPPLY OF SPACE AND AIR
LJ004-0094 THIS ACT SET FORTH THAT WHEREAS THE MALIGNANT FEVER COMMONLY CALLED THE JAIL DISTEMPER
LJ004-0095 IS FOUND TO BE OWING TO WANT OF CLEANLINESS AND FRESH AIR IN THE SEVERAL JAILS
LJ004-0096 THE FATAL CONSEQUENCES WHEREOF MIGHT BE PREVENTED IF THE JUSTICES OF THE PEACE WERE DULY AUTHORIZED
LJ004-0097 TO PROVIDE SUCH ACCOMMODATIONS IN JAILS AS MAY BE NECESSARY TO ANSWER THIS SALUTARY PURPOSE
LJ004-0098 IT IS ENACTED THAT THE JUSTICES SHALL ORDER THE WALLS OF EVERY ROOM TO BE SCRAPED AND WHITEWASHED ONCE EVERY YEAR
LJ004-0099 VENTILATORS HAND AND OTHERS WERE TO BE SUPPLIED
LJ004-0100 AN INFIRMARY CONSISTING OF TWO DISTINCT ROOMS ONE FOR MALES AND ONE FOR FEMALES SHOULD BE PROVIDED FOR THE SEPARATE ACCOMMODATION OF THE SICK
LJ004-0101 WARM AND COLD BATHS OR COMMODIOUS BATHING TUBS
LJ004-0102 WERE TO BE KEPT IN EVERY JAIL AND THE PRISONERS DIRECTED TO WASH IN THEM BEFORE RELEASE. THESE PROVISIONS WERE ALMOST A DEAD LETTER
LJ004-0103 YET ANOTHER ACT PASSED IN 1791 IF PROPERLY OBSERVED SHOULD HAVE INSURED PROPER ATTENTION TO THEM
LJ004-0104 BY THE THIRTY ONE GEORGE III. C. FORTY SIX S. FIVE
LJ004-0105 TWO OR MORE JUSTICES WERE APPOINTED VISITORS OF PRISONS AND DIRECTED TO VISIT AND INSPECT THREE TIMES EVERY QUARTER
LJ004-0106 THEY WERE TO REPORT IN WRITING TO QUARTER SESSIONS AS TO THE STATE OF THE JAIL AND AS TO ALL ABUSES WHICH THEY MIGHT OBSERVE THEREIN
LJ004-0107 THE MOST IMPORTANT JAIL ACT OF THAT EARLY PERIOD HOWEVER WAS THE 24 GEORGE III. C. 54 S. 4 1784
LJ004-0108 WHICH WAS THE FIRST LEGISLATIVE ATTEMPT TO COMPEL THE CLASSIFICATION OF PRISONERS OR THEIR SEPARATION INTO CLASSES
LJ004-0109 ACCORDING TO THEIR CATEGORIES OR CRIMES
LJ004-0110 IT WAS MADE INCUMBENT UPON THE JUSTICES TO PROVIDE DISTINCT PLACES OF CONFINEMENT FOR FIVE CLASSES OF PRISONERS VIZ
LJ004-0111 ONE PRISONERS CONVICTED OF FELONY TWO PRISONERS COMMITTED ON A CHARGE OR SUSPICION OF FELONY
LJ004-0112 THREE PRISONERS GUILTY OF MISDEMEANORS FOUR PRISONERS CHARGED WITH MISDEMEANORS FIVE DEBTORS
LJ004-0113 IT WAS FURTHER ORDERED THAT MALE PRISONERS SHOULD BE KEPT PERFECTLY DISTINCT FROM THE FEMALES
LJ004-0114 KING'S EVIDENCES WERE ALSO TO BE LODGED APART
LJ004-0115 INFIRMARIES SEPARATING THE SEXES WERE ALSO TO BE PROVIDED A CHAPEL TOO AND WARM AND COLD BATHS
LJ004-0116 CARE ALSO WAS TO BE TAKEN THAT THE PRISONERS SHALL NOT BE KEPT IN ANY APARTMENT UNDERGROUND
LJ004-0117 IN AN EARLY REPORT OF THE PRISON DISCIPLINE IMPROVEMENT SOCIETY
LJ004-0118 PUBLISHED SOME SIXANDTHIRTY YEARS AFTER THE PROMULGATION OF THIS ACT THE FLAGRANT AND PERSISTENT VIOLATIONS OF IT AND OTHERS
LJ004-0119 WHICH HAD CONTINUED THROUGH THAT LONG PERIOD ARE FORCIBLY POINTED OUT
LJ004-0120 IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN OUT OF FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN PRISONS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM
LJ004-0121 TO WHICH A TOTAL OF UPWARDS OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PRISONERS HAD BEEN COMMITTED IN THE YEAR ONLY TWENTYTHREE PRISONS WERE DIVIDED ACCORDING TO LAW
LJ004-0122 FIFTYNINE HAD NO DIVISION WHATEVER TO SEPARATE MALES AND FEMALES ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTYSIX HAD ONLY ONE DIVISION FOR THE PURPOSE
LJ004-0123 SIXTYEIGHT HAD ONLY TWO DIVISIONS AND SO ON
LJ004-0124 IN FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTYFIVE PRISONS NO WORK OF ANY DESCRIPTION HAD BEEN INTRODUCED FOR THE EMPLOYMENT OF PRISONERS
LJ004-0125 IN THE BALANCE SOME WORK WAS DONE BUT WITH THE MOST MEAGER RESULTS
LJ004-0126 THE WANT OF ROOM WAS STILL A CRYING EVIL
LJ004-0127 IN ONE HUNDRED JAILS
LJ004-0128 CAPABLE OF ACCOMMODATING ONLY EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTYFIVE PERSONS AS MANY AS THIRTEEN THOUSAND AND FIFTYSEVEN WERE CROWDED
LJ004-0129 MANY OF THE JAILS WERE IN THE MOST DEPLORABLE CONDITION
LJ004-0130 INCOMMODIOUS AS HAS BEEN STATED INSECURE UNHEALTHY AND UNPROVIDED WITH THE PRINTED OR WRITTEN REGULATIONS REQUIRED BY LAW
LJ004-0131 TO SPECIFY MORE PARTICULARLY ONE OR TWO OF THE WORST IT MAY BE MENTIONED THAT IN THE BOROUGH COMPTER
LJ004-0132 THE OLD EVILS OF INDISCRIMINATE ASSOCIATION STILL CONTINUED UNCHECKED
LJ004-0133 ALL PRISONERS PASSED THEIR TIME IN ABSOLUTE IDLENESS OR KILLED IT BY GAMBLING AND LOOSE CONVERSATION
LJ004-0134 THE DEBTORS WERE CROWDED ALMOST INCONCEIVABLY. IN A SPACE TWENTY FEET LONG BY SIX WIDE
LJ004-0135 TWENTY MEN SLEPT ON EIGHT STRAW BEDS WITH SIXTEEN RUGS AMONGST THEM AND A PIECE OF TIMBER FOR A BOLSTER
LJ004-0136 MR. BUXTON WHO FOUND THIS DECLARED THAT IT SEEMED PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE BUT HE WAS ASSURED THAT IT WAS TRUE
LJ004-0137 AND THAT IT WAS ACCOMPLISHED BY SLEEPING EDGEWISE
LJ004-0138 ONE POOR WRETCH WHO HAD SLEPT NEXT THE WALL SAID HE HAD BEEN LITERALLY UNABLE TO MOVE FOR THE PRESSURE
LJ004-0139 IN THE MORNING THE STENCH AND HEAT WERE SO OPPRESSIVE THAT HE AND EVERY ONE ELSE ON WAKING RUSHED UNCLOTHED INTO THE YARD
LJ004-0140 AND THE TURNKEY TOLD MR. BUXTON THAT THE SMELL ON FIRST OPENING THE DOOR WAS ENOUGH TO KNOCK DOWN A HORSE
LJ004-0141 THE HOSPITAL WAS FILLED WITH INFECTIOUS CASES AND IN ONE ROOM SEVEN FEET BY NINE WITH CLOSED WINDOWS
LJ004-0142 WHERE A LAD LAY ILL WITH FEVER THREE OTHER PRISONERS AT FIRST PERFECTLY HEALTHY WERE LODGED. OF COURSE THEY WERE SEIZED WITH THE FEVER
LJ004-0143 SO THAT THE CULPRIT IN ADDITION TO HIS SENTENCE
LJ004-0144 HAD TO ENDURE BY THE REGULATIONS OF THE CITY A DISEASE VERY DANGEROUS IN ITS NATURE AND RAN THE RISK OF A LINGERING AND PAINFUL DEATH
LJ004-0145 AT GUILDFORD PRISON WHICH MR. BUXTON ALSO VISITED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN
LJ004-0146 THERE WAS NO INFIRMARY NO CHAPEL NO WORK NO CLASSIFICATION
LJ004-0147 THE IRONS WHICH NEARLY EVERY ONE WORE WERE REMARKABLY HEAVY THOSE DOUBLE IRONED COULD NOT TAKE OFF THEIR SMALL CLOTHES
LJ004-0148 NO PRISON DRESS WAS ALLOWED AND HALF THE INMATES WERE WITHOUT SHIRTS OR SHOES OR STOCKINGS
LJ004-0149 THE DIET WAS LIMITED TO DRY BREAD WHICH WAS OF THE BEST CERTAINLY AND A POUND AND A HALF IN WEIGHT
LJ004-0150 MATTERS WERE ON MUCH THE SAME FOOTING AT ST. ALBANS
LJ004-0151 THEY WERE FAR WORSE AT BRISTOL
LJ004-0152 ALTHOUGH AT MR. BUXTON'S VISIT A NEW JAIL WAS IN PROCESS OF ERECTION THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS REFORM SINCE HOWARD'S VISITATION IN 1774
LJ004-0153 IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN THE OLD JAIL WAS SO DENSELY PACKED THAT IT WAS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO PASS THROUGH THE YARDS FOR THE THRONG
LJ004-0154 ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY WERE LODGED IN A PRISON JUST CAPABLE OF HOLDING FIFTYTWO
LJ004-0155 IN THE CROWD ALL OF THEM PERSONS WHO HAD NO OTHER AVOCATION OR MODE OF LIVELIHOOD BUT THIEVING MR. BUXTON COUNTED ELEVEN CHILDREN
LJ004-0156 CHILDREN HARDLY OLD ENOUGH TO BE RELEASED FROM THE NURSERY
LJ004-0157 ALL CHARGED WITH FELONY WERE IN HEAVY IRONS WITHOUT DISTINCTION OF AGE
LJ004-0158 ALL WERE IN ILL HEALTH ALMOST ALL WERE IN RAGS ALMOST ALL WERE FILTHY IN THE EXTREME
LJ004-0159 THE STATE OF THE PRISON THE DESPERATION OF THE PRISONERS BROADLY HINTED IN THEIR CONVERSATION AND PLAINLY EXPRESSED IN THEIR CONDUCT
LJ004-0160 THE UPROAR OF OATHS COMPLAINTS AND OBSCENITY
LJ004-0161 THE INDESCRIBABLE STENCH PRESENTED TOGETHER A CONCENTRATION OF THE UTMOST MISERY AND THE UTMOST GUILT
LJ004-0162 IT WAS A SCENE OF INFERNAL PASSIONS AND DISTRESSES SAYS BUXTON WHICH FEW HAVE IMAGINATION SUFFICIENT TO PICTURE
LJ004-0163 AND OF WHICH FEWER STILL WOULD BELIEVE THAT THE ORIGINAL IS TO BE FOUND IN THIS ENLIGHTENED AND HAPPY COUNTRY
LJ004-0164 THERE WAS STILL WORSE TO COME. HAVING EXPLORED THE YARDS AND ADJACENT DAY ROOMS AND SLEEPING CELLS A DOOR WAS UNLOCKED
LJ004-0165 THE VISITORS WERE FURNISHED WITH CANDLES AND THEY DESCENDED EIGHTEEN LONG STEPS INTO A VAULT
LJ004-0166 AT THE BOTTOM WAS A CIRCULAR SPACE THROUGH WHICH RAN A NARROW PASSAGE AND THE SIDES OF WHICH WERE FITTED WITH BARRACK BEDSTEADS
LJ004-0167 THE FLOOR WAS ON THE LEVEL OF THE RIVER AND VERY DAMP
LJ004-0168 THE SMELL AT ONE O'CLOCK OF THE DAY WAS SOMETHING MORE THAN CAN BE EXPRESSED BY THE TERM DISGUSTING
LJ004-0169 ON THE DIRTY BEDSTEAD LAY A WRETCHED BEING IN THE THROES OF SEVERE ILLNESS
LJ004-0170 THE ONLY VENTILATION OF THIS PIT THIS DARK CHEERLESS DAMP UNWHOLESOME CAVERN  A DUNGEON IN ITS WORST SENSE
LJ004-0171 WAS BY A KIND OF CHIMNEY WHICH THE PRISONERS KEPT HERMETICALLY SEALED AND WHICH HAD NEVER BEEN OPENED IN THE MEMORY OF THE TURNKEY
LJ004-0172 UNTRIED PERSONS WERE OFTEN LODGED IN THIS NAUSEOUS UNDERGROUND DEN
LJ004-0173 AND SOMETIMES SLEPT IN THE PIT LOADED WITH HEAVY IRONS FOR A WHOLE YEAR WAITING THE JAIL DELIVERY
LJ004-0174 CONFINEMENT FOR TWELVE MONTHS IN THE BRISTOL JAIL WAS COUNTED A PUNISHMENT EQUIVALENT TO SEVEN YEARS' TRANSPORTATION
LJ004-0175 IN THIS PRISON THERE WAS NO FEMALE INFIRMARY
LJ004-0176 SICK WOMEN AND THEIR CHILDREN REMAINED IN THE ORDINARY WARDS AND PROPAGATED DISEASE
LJ004-0177 NO PRISON DRESS WAS ALLOWED NO RECEPTIONROOM WAS PROVIDED NO SOAP TOWELS OR BATHS
LJ004-0178 THE BEDCLOTHES CONSISTED ONLY OF A SINGLE VERY SLIGHT RUG
LJ004-0179 THE ALLOWANCE OF FOOD DAILY TO FELONS WAS A FOURPENNY LOAF
LJ004-0180 A PRICE WHICH IN THOSE DAYS FLUCTUATED ENORMOUSLY  AS MUCH AS A HUNDRED PERCENT IN A COUPLE OF YEARS
LJ004-0181 BUT AS NO SIMILAR VARIATION OCCURRED IN THE PRISONER'S APPETITE HIS RATION WAS SOMEWHAT PRECARIOUS
LJ004-0182 AS FOR THE DEBTORS THEY HAD NO ALLOWANCE WHATEVER AND WERE OFTEN IN IMMINENT DANGER OF STARVATION
LJ004-0183 WITH ALL THIS THE INMATES WERE CROWDED TOGETHER AT NIGHT TO SUCH A DEGREE AS TO EXCITE SURPRISE THAT THEY SHOULD ESCAPE SUFFOCATION
LJ004-0184 THERE REIGNED THROUGH THE WHOLE EDIFICE A CHILLY DAMP UNWHOLESOME ATMOSPHERE AND THE EFFLUVIA FROM THE PRISONERS WAS SO NAUSEOUS
LJ004-0185 THAT THE CHAPLAIN FOUND IT NECESSARY TO TAKE HIS PLACE BEFORE THEY ENTERED CHAPEL AS HE COULD NOT OTHERWISE HAVE FACED THE SMELL
LJ004-0186 IT IS CONSOLING TO KNOW THAT THERE WERE A FEW BRILLIANT EXCEPTIONS TO THIS CRUEL CALLOUS NEGLECT
LJ004-0187 ALREADY AS EARLY AS EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN A PRISON EXISTED AT BURY ST. EDMUNDS WHICH WAS A MODEL FOR IMITATION TO OTHERS AT THAT TIME
LJ004-0188 AND WHICH EVEN FULFILLED MANY OF THE EXACTING REQUIREMENTS OF MODERN DAYS
LJ004-0189 THE GREAT PRINCIPLES OF CLASSIFICATION CLEANLINESS AND EMPLOYMENT WERE CLOSELY OBSERVED
LJ004-0190 THERE WERE EIGHTYFOUR SEPARATE SLEEPINGCELLS AND UNLESS THE JAIL WAS OVERCROWDED EVERY INMATE PASSED THE NIGHT ALONE
LJ004-0191 AND IN COMPARATIVE COMFORT WITH A BED AND PROPER BEDDING
LJ004-0192 THE PRISON STOOD ON A DRY AIRY SITUATION OUTSIDE THE TOWN
LJ004-0193 PRISONERS ON RECEPTION WERE TREATED AS THEY ARE NOWADAYS  BATHED DRESSED IN PRISON CLOTHES AND INSPECTED BY THE SURGEON
LJ004-0194 NO IRONS WERE WORN EXCEPT AS A PUNISHMENT
LJ004-0195 PERSONAL CLEANLINESS WAS INSISTED UPON AND ALL PARTS OF THE PRISON WERE KEPT SCRUPULOUSLY CLEAN
LJ004-0196 THERE WAS AN INFIRMARY PROPERLY FOUND AND DULY LOOKED AFTER
LJ004-0197 NO IDLENESS WAS PERMITTED AMONG THE INMATES TRADES WERE TAUGHT OR PRISONERS WERE ALLOWED TO FOLLOW THEIR OWN IF SUITABLE
LJ004-0198 THERE WAS BESIDES A MILL FOR GRINDING CORN SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO A TURNSPIT WHICH PRISONERS TURNED BY WALKING IN ROWS
LJ004-0199 THIS MADE EXERTION COMPULSORY AND IMPOSED HARD LABOR AS A PROPER PUNISHMENT
LJ004-0200 ANOTHER JAIL THAT OF ILCHESTER WAS ALSO WORTHY OF ALL COMMENDATION. IT EXHIBITED ALL THE GOOD POINTS OF THAT AT BURY
LJ004-0201 AT ILCHESTER THE RULE OF EMPLOYMENT HAD BEEN CARRIED FURTHER
LJ004-0202 A SYSTEM NOT ADOPTED GENERALLY TILL NEARLY HALF A CENTURY LATER HAD ALREADY PREVAILED AT ILCHESTER
LJ004-0203 THE NEW JAIL HAD BEEN IN A GREAT MEASURE CONSTRUCTED BY THE PRISONERS THEMSELVES
LJ004-0204 MASONS BRICKLAYERS CARPENTERS PAINTERS HAD BEEN EMPLOYED UPON THE BUILDINGS AND THE WORK WAS PRONOUNCED EXCELLENT BY COMPETENT JUDGES
LJ004-0205 INDUSTRIAL LABOR HAD ALSO BEEN INTRODUCED WITH SATISFACTORY RESULTS
LJ004-0206 BLANKET WEAVING AND CLOTH SPINNING WAS CARRIED ON PROSPEROUSLY
LJ004-0207 AND ALL THE MATERIAL FOR PRISONERS' APPAREL WAS MANUFACTURED IN THE JAIL
LJ004-0208 THERE WERE WORKROOMS FOR WOOLWASHING DYEING CARDING AND SPINNING
LJ004-0209 THE LOOMS WERE CONSTANTLY BUSY. TAILORS WERE ALWAYS AT WORK AND EVERY ARTICLE OF CLOTHING AND BEDDING WAS MADE UP WITHIN THE WALLS
LJ004-0210 THERE WAS A PRISON LAUNDRY TOO WHERE ALL THE PRISONERS' LINEN WAS REGULARLY WASHED
LJ004-0211 THE MORAL WELFARE OF THE INMATES WAS AS CLOSELY LOOKED AFTER AS THE PHYSICAL
LJ004-0212 THERE WAS AN ATTENTIVE CHAPLAIN A SCHOOLMASTER AND REGULAR RELIGIOUS AND OTHER INSTRUCTION
LJ004-0213 COMPARED WITH THOSE HIGHLY MERITORIOUS INSTITUTIONS NEWGATE STILL SHOWED BUT BADLY
LJ004-0214 ITS EVILS WERE INHERENT AND IRREMEDIABLE BUT SOME AMELIORATING MEASURES HAD BEEN INTRODUCED
LJ004-0215 MAINLY THROUGH THE EXERTIONS OF A NEW GOVERNOR MR. BROWN WHO SUCCEEDED MR. NEWMAN AT NEWGATE IN 1817
LJ004-0216 THE MOST NOTICEABLE OF THE IMPROVEMENTS INTRODUCED WAS A BETTER REGULATION OF DIETARIES WITHIN THE PRISON
LJ004-0217 THE OLD HAPHAZARD SYSTEM BY WHICH MEAT WAS ISSUED IN BULK
LJ004-0218 A WEEK'S ALLOWANCE AT A TIME WAS ABOLISHED AND THERE WAS A REGULAR SCALE OF DAILY RATIONS ADOPTED
LJ004-0219 THE DIET WAS NOW AMPLE IT CONSISTED OF A POUND AND A HALF OF BREAD PER DIEM
LJ004-0220 FOR BREAKFAST A PINT OF GRUEL FOR DINNER HALF A POUND OF BOILED MEAT OR A QUART OF SOUP WITH VEGETABLES ON ALTERNATE DAYS
LJ004-0221 THE FOOD WAS PROPERLY PREPARED IN THE PRISON KITCHEN
LJ004-0222 MEAT WAS NO LONGER ISSUED RAW TO BE IMPERFECTLY COOKED BEFORE A WARD FIRE AND BOLTED GLUTTONOUSLY THE WHOLE TWO POUNDS AT ONE SITTING
LJ004-0223 MR. BROWN CONFIDENTLY ASSERTED THAT NO JAIL IN ENGLAND NOW FED ITS INMATES SO WELL AS DID NEWGATE
LJ004-0224 SO PLENTIFUL WAS THIS DIETARY THAT ALTHOUGH THE OLD PERMISSION REMAINED IN FORCE OF ALLOWING THE FRIENDS OF PRISONERS TO BRING THEM SUPPLIES FROM OUTSIDE
LJ004-0225 THE PRACTICE WAS FALLING INTO ABEYANCE AND THE PRISONERS SELDOM REQUIRED PRIVATE ASSISTANCE TO EKE OUT THEIR MEALS
LJ004-0226 IT WAS ALSO CLAIMED FOR THE MORE AMPLE AND MORE ORDERLY DISTRIBUTION OF VICTUALS THAT THE GENERAL HEALTH OF THE PRISONERS HAD GREATLY IMPROVED
LJ004-0227 MR. BROWN ALSO MUCH TO HIS OWN CREDIT BROUGHT ABOUT THE ABANDONMENT OF THE PRACTICE OF IRONING ALL PRISONERS AS A MATTER OF COURSE
LJ004-0228 IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN PRISONERS AWAITING TRIAL IN NEWGATE WERE AT LENGTH RELIEVED FROM THIS ILLEGAL INFLICTION
LJ004-0229 CONVICTS WERE NOT EVEN COMPELLED TO WEAR IRONS PROVIDING THEY BEHAVED WELL
LJ004-0230 IT WAS FOUND THAT SHACKLES MIGHT BE SAFELY DISPENSED WITH EVEN IN THE CASE OF THE MOST DESPERATE CHARACTERS
LJ004-0231 THIS WAS EFFECTED BY STOPPING THE NEARLY INDISCRIMINATE ADMISSION OF VISITORS WHICH HAD HITHERTO PREVAILED ALL OVER THE JAIL
LJ004-0232 IRONING IT WILL BE REMEMBERED WAS A DISTINGUISHING BADGE SO THAT WHEN THE JAIL WAS CLEARED THE FREE MIGHT BE READILY KNOWN FROM THE CAPTIVE AND ESCAPES PREVENTED
LJ004-0233 UNDER THE NEW RULE VISITORS WERE NOT ALLOWED TO PASS INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE PRISON BUT WERE DETAINED BETWEEN THE GRATING
LJ004-0234 THIS CHANGE LED TO SOME DISCONTENT UNTIL IT WAS FOUND THAT THE MUCH GREATER BOON OF RELIEF FROM IRONS ACCOMPANIED IT AND THE REFORM WAS QUIETLY ACCEPTED
LJ004-0235 INDEED THE BEST CONSEQUENCES FOLLOWED FROM THE REMOVAL OF IRONS. THE PRISONERS WERE MUCH BETTER DISPOSED THERE WERE NO RIOTS AND FEWER DISTURBANCES
LJ004-0236 BUT NOTHING SHORT OF RADICAL REFORM AND COMPLETE RECONSTRUCTION COULD TOUCH THE DEEPSEATED EVILS OF ASSOCIATION OVERCROWDING AND IDLENESS
LJ004-0237 THE FIRST STILL PRODUCED DEPLORABLE RESULTS  RESULTS TO BE OBSERVABLE FOR MANY YEARS TO COME
LJ004-0238 MR. BUXTON MENTIONS THE CASE OF A BOY WHOSE APPARENT INNOCENCE AND ARTLESSNESS HAD ATTRACTED HIS ATTENTION
LJ004-0239 HE HAD BEEN COMMITTED FOR AN OFFENSE FOR WHICH HE WAS ACQUITTED
LJ004-0240 HE LEFT NEWGATE UTTERLY CORRUPTED AND AFTER LAPSING INTO CRIME SOON RETURNED WITH A VERY DIFFERENT CHARACTER
LJ004-0241 OTHER CASES OF MORAL DETERIORATION HAVE ALREADY BEEN RECORDED
LJ004-0242 SOME ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO REDUCE THE OVERCROWDING ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS COMMITTEE OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN BUT THIS APPLIED ONLY A PARTIAL REMEDY
LJ004-0243 THE BULK OF THE PRISONERS WERE STILL LEFT IN IDLENESS
LJ004-0244 A FEW FORTUNATE CRIMINALS MANY OF THEM KEPT BACK FROM TRANSPORTATION ON PURPOSE WHO WERE SKILLED IN TRADES WERE EMPLOYED AT THEM
LJ004-0245 PAINTERS PLASTERERS AND CARPENTERS WERE ALLOWED TO FOLLOW THEIR HANDICRAFTS WITH THE REWARD OF SIXPENCE PER DIEM AND A DOUBLE ALLOWANCE OF FOOD
LJ004-0246 THEY USED THEIR OWN TOOLS AND THIS WITHOUT ANY DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCES AS REGARDS FACILITATING THE ESCAPE OF OTHERS
LJ004-0247 THUS DISPOSING OF THE OBJECTION SO LONG RAISED AGAINST THE INDUSTRIAL EMPLOYMENT OF PRISONERS IN NEWGATE
LJ004-0248 BUT THIS BOON OF TOIL WAS DENIED TO ALL BUT A VERY LIMITED NUMBER
LJ004-0249 AS THE PRISON DISCIPLINE SOCIETY PERTINENTLY OBSERVED IN A REPORT DATED EIGHTEEN TWENTY
LJ004-0250 IT IS OBVIOUS THAT REFORMATION MUST BE MATERIALLY IMPEDED AND IN SOME CASES UTTERLY DEFEATED WHEN THE PRISONERS ARE DEFECTIVELY CLASSED
LJ005-0001 THE CHRONICLES OF NEWGATE VOLUME TWO BY ARTHUR GRIFFITHS SECTION EIGHT THE BEGINNINGS OF PRISON REFORM
LJ005-0002 NEWGATE PRISONERS WERE THE VICTIMS TO ANOTHER MOST OBJECTIONABLE PRACTICE WHICH OBTAINED ALL OVER LONDON
LJ005-0003 PERSONS COMMITTED TO A METROPOLITAN JAIL AT THAT TIME WERE TAKEN IN GANGS MEN AND WOMEN HANDCUFFED TOGETHER OR LINKED ON TO A LONG CHAIN
LJ005-0004 UNLESS THEY COULD AFFORD TO PAY FOR A VEHICLE OUT OF THEIR OWN FUNDS
LJ005-0005 EVEN THEN THEY WERE NOT CERTAIN OF THE FAVOR FOR I FIND A REFERENCE TO A DECENT AND RESPECTABLE WOMAN SENT TO NEWGATE
LJ005-0006 WHO HANDED A SHILLING TO THE ESCORT WARDER TO PROVIDE HER WITH A HACKNEY COACH BUT THIS FUNCTIONARY POCKETED THE CASH AND OBLIGED THE WOMAN TO WALK
LJ005-0007 CHAINED TO THE REST AS THE MISERABLE CREW FILED THROUGH THE PUBLIC STREETS EXPOSED TO THE SCORNFUL GAZE OF EVERY PASSENGER
LJ005-0008 THEY WERE FOLLOWED BY A CROWD OF RECKLESS BOYS WHO JEERED AT AND INSULTED THEM
LJ005-0009 MANY THUS LED IN PROCESSION WERE IN A SHOCKING CONDITION OF DIRT AND MISERY FREQUENTLY NEARLY NAKED AND OFTEN BEARING UPON THEM
LJ005-0010 THE GERMS MORE OR LESS DEVELOPED OF CONTAGIOUS DISEASE. CARAVANS THE FORERUNNERS OF THE PRISON VANS
LJ005-0011 WERE FIRST MADE USE OF ABOUT 1827 THAT THE NEED FOR PRISON REFORM WAS IMPERATIVE MAY BE GATHERED FROM THE FEW OUT OF MANY INSTANCES I HAVE ADDUCED
LJ005-0012 YET THERE WERE THOSE WHO WEDDED TO ANCIENT IDEAS WERE INTOLERANT OF CHANGE THEY WOULD NOT ADMIT THE EXISTENCE OF ANY EVILS
LJ005-0013 ONE SMUG ALDERMAN A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS SNEERED AT THE ULTRA PHILANTHROPY OF THE CHAMPIONS OF PRISON IMPROVEMENT
LJ005-0014 SPEAKING ON A DEBATE ON PRISON MATTERS HE DECLARED THAT
LJ005-0015 OUR PRISONERS HAVE ALL THAT PRISONERS OUGHT TO HAVE WITHOUT GENTLEMEN THINK THEY OUGHT TO BE INDULGED WITH TURKEY CARPETS
LJ005-0016 THE SOCIETY FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF PRISON DISCIPLINE WAS TAXED WITH A DESIRE TO INTRODUCE A SYSTEM
LJ005-0017 TENDING TO DIVEST PUNISHMENT OF ITS JUST AND SALUTARY TERRORS
LJ005-0018 AN IMPUTATION WHICH THE SOCIETY INDIGNANTLY AND VERY JUSTLY REPUDIATED THE STATEMENT BEING AS THEY SAID
LJ005-0019 REFUTED BY ABUNDANT EVIDENCE AND HAVING NO FOUNDATION WHATEVER IN TRUTH
LJ005-0020 AMONG THOSE WHOM THE SOCIETY FOUND ARRAYED AGAINST IT WAS SYDNEY SMITH
LJ005-0021 WHO IN A CAUSTIC ARTICLE CONTRIBUTED TO THE 'EDINBURGH REVIEW' PROTESTED AGAINST THE PAMPERING OF CRIMINALS
LJ005-0022 WHILE FULLY ADMITTING THE GOOD INTENTIONS OF THE SOCIETY HE CONDEMNED THEIR ULTRA HUMANITARIANISM AS MISPLACED
LJ005-0023 HE TOOK EXCEPTION TO VARIOUS OF THE PROPOSALS OF THE SOCIETY HE THOUGHT THEY LEANT TOO MUCH TO A SYSTEM OF INDULGENCE AND EDUCATION IN JAILS
LJ005-0024 HE OBJECTED TO THE INSTRUCTION OF PRISONERS IN READING AND WRITING
LJ005-0025 A POOR MAN WHO IS LUCKY ENOUGH HE SAID TO HAVE HIS SON COMMITTED FOR A FELONY
LJ005-0026 EDUCATES HIM UNDER SUCH A SYSTEM FOR NOTHING WHILE THE VIRTUOUS SIMPLETON WHO IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL IS PAYING BY THE QUARTER FOR THESE ATTAINMENTS
LJ005-0027 HE WAS ALTOGETHER AGAINST TOO LIBERAL A DIET HE DISAPPROVED OF INDUSTRIAL OCCUPATIONS IN JAILS AS NOT CALCULATED TO RENDER PRISONS TERRIBLE
LJ005-0028 THERE SHOULD BE NO TEA AND SUGAR NO ASSEMBLAGE OF FEMALE FELONS AROUND THE WASHINGTUB
LJ005-0029 NOTHING BUT BEATING HEMP AND PULLING OAKUM AND POUNDING BRICKS  NO WORK BUT WHAT WAS TEDIOUS UNUSUAL
LJ005-0030 IN PRISONS WHICH ARE REALLY MEANT TO KEEP THE MULTITUDE IN ORDER AND TO BE A TERROR TO EVILDOERS THERE MUST BE NO SHARINGS OF PROFITS
LJ005-0031 NO VISITING OF FRIENDS NO EDUCATION BUT RELIGIOUS EDUCATION NO FREEDOM OF DIET
LJ005-0032 NO WEAVERS' LOOMS OR CARPENTERS' BENCHES THERE MUST BE A GREAT DEAL OF SOLITUDE COARSE FOOD A DRESS OF SHAME
LJ005-0033 HARD INCESSANT IRKSOME ETERNAL LABOR A PLANNED AND REGULATED AND UNRELENTING EXCLUSION OF HAPPINESS AND COMFORT
LJ005-0034 UNDETERRED BY THESE SARCASMS AND MISREPRESENTATIONS
LJ005-0035 THE SOCIETY PURSUED ITS LAUDABLE UNDERTAKING WITH REMARKABLE ENERGY AND GREAT SINGLENESS OF PURPOSE
LJ005-0036 THE OBJECTS IT HAD IN VIEW WERE SET FORTH IN ONE OF ITS EARLIEST MEETINGS
LJ005-0037 IT SOUGHT TO OBTAIN AND DIFFUSE USEFUL INFORMATION
LJ005-0038 TO SUGGEST BENEFICIAL REGULATIONS AND CIRCULATE TRACTS DEMONSTRATING THE ADVANTAGES OF CLASSIFICATION
LJ005-0039 CONSTANT INSPECTION REGULAR EMPLOYMENT AND HUMANE TREATMENT GENERALLY WITH RELIGIOUS AND MORAL INSTRUCTION
LJ005-0040 IT EARNESTLY ADVOCATED THE APPOINTMENT OF FEMALE OFFICERS TO TAKE EXCLUSIVE CHARGE OF FEMALE PRISONERS
LJ005-0041 A MUCHNEEDED AND ACCORDING TO OUR IDEAS INDISPENSABLE REFORM ALREADY INITIATED BY THE LADIES' COMMITTEE AT NEWGATE
LJ005-0042 IT MADE THE SUBJECT OF THE NEWLYINVENTED TREADWHEELS OR STEPPINGWHEELS AS THEY WERE AT FIRST CALLED ITS PECULIAR AFFAIR
LJ005-0043 AND OBTAINED FULL DETAILS FROM PLACES WHERE THEY HAD BEEN ADOPTED OF THE NATURE OF THESE NEW MACHINES
LJ005-0044 THE METHOD BY WHICH THEY WERE WORKED AND THE DIETARIES OF THE PRISONERS EMPLOYED UPON THEM
LJ005-0045 NOR DID IT CONFINE ITSELF TO MERE VERBAL RECOMMENDATIONS
LJ005-0046 THE GOOD IT TRIED TO DO TOOK ACTIVE SHAPE IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF TEMPORARY REFUGES  AT HOXTON FOR MALES AND IN THE HACKNEY ROAD FOR FEMALES
LJ005-0047 FOR THE RECEPTION OF DESERVING CASES DISCHARGED FROM PRISON. THE GOVERNOR OF NEWGATE AND OTHER METROPOLITAN PRISONS HAD ORDERS OF ADMISSION TO THIS REFUGE
LJ005-0048 WHICH HE COULD BESTOW ON PRISONERS ON RELEASE AND SO SAVE THE BETTERDISPOSED OR THE COMPLETELY DESTITUTE FROM LAPSING AT ONCE INTO CRIME
LJ005-0049 THE REFUGE WHICH HAD FOR ITS OBJECT THE TRAINING OF ITS INMATES IN HABITS OF INDUSTRY
LJ005-0050 AND IN MORAL AND RELIGIOUS DUTY AND WHICH AFTER A TIME SOUGHT TO PROVIDE THEM WITH SUITABLE SITUATIONS WAS SUPPORTED ENTIRELY OUT OF THE FUNDS OF THE SOCIETY
LJ005-0051 AT THE TIME OF ITS GREATEST PROSPERITY ITS ANNUAL INCOME FROM DONATIONS AND SUBSCRIPTIONS WAS ABOUT ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED POUNDS
LJ005-0052 ANOTHER POINT TO WHICH THE SOCIETY DEVOTED INFINITE PAINS WAS THE PREPARATION OF PLANS FOR THE GUIDANCE OF ARCHITECTS IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF PRISONS
LJ005-0053 A VERY VALUABLE VOLUME PUBLISHED BY THE SOCIETY
LJ005-0054 TRACED THE PROGRESS OF PRISON ARCHITECTURE FROM THE DAYS WHEN THE JAIL WAS THE MERE ANNEXE OF THE BARONIAL OR EPISCOPAL CASTLE
LJ005-0055 OR A DUNGEON ABOVE OR BELOW THE GATE OF A TOWN TO THE FIRST ATTEMPTS AT SYSTEMATIC RECONSTRUCTION CARRIED OUT UNDER THE ADVICE AND SUPERVISION OF HOWARD
LJ005-0056 IT IS INTERESTING TO OBSERVE THAT THE PLAN OF RADIATION BY WHICH THE PRISON BLOCKS RADIATED FROM A CENTRAL HALL LIKE SPOKES IN A WHEEL
LJ005-0057 WAS INTRODUCED AS EARLY AS SEVENTENEN NINETY BY MR. BLACKBURN
LJ005-0058 AN ARCHITECT OF EMINENCE WHO WAS VERY LARGELY EMPLOYED IN THE ERECTION OF PRISON BUILDINGS AT THE CLOSE OF THE LAST CENTURY
LJ005-0059 WITH SOME IMPORTANT MODIFICATIONS THIS PRINCIPLE OF RADIATION IS STILL THE RULE
LJ005-0060 THE SOCIETY DID NOT LIMIT ITS REMARKS TO THE DESCRIPTION OF WHAT HAD ALREADY BEEN DONE
LJ005-0061 BUT IT OFFERED SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE BUILDINGS WITH NUMEROUS CAREFULLYEXECUTED DRAWINGS AND DESIGNS OF THE MODEL IT RECOMMENDED FOR IMITATION
LJ005-0062 EXPERIENCE HAS SINCE SHOWN THAT IN SOME RESPECTS THESE PLANS ARE DEFECTIVE ESPECIALLY IN THE PLACING OF THE GOVERNOR'S RESIDENCE IN THE CENTER OF THE PRISON
LJ005-0063 IT WAS THOUGHT THAT THIS WOULD GUARANTEE CONSTANT SUPERVISION AND INSPECTION BUT IT DID NOTHING OF THE KIND AND ONLY THE PRESENCE OF WARDERS ON DUTY
LJ005-0064 IS FOUND NOWADAYS TO BE REALLY EFFICACIOUS. THE MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS HOWEVER ARE BASED UPON COMMON SENSE
LJ005-0065 AND NONE ARE MORE COMMENDABLE THAN THAT WHICH DEPRECATES THE EXCESSIVE ORNAMENTATION OF THE EXTERNAL PARTS OF THE EDIFICE
LJ005-0066 THE NEW JAILS AS HOWARD SAYS HAVING POMPOUS FRONTS APPEAR LIKE PALACES TO THE LOWER CLASS OF PEOPLE AND MANY PERSONS ARE AGAINST THEM ON THIS ACCOUNT
LJ005-0067 THE PRISON SOCIETY REPROVES THE MISDIRECTED EFFORTS OF AMBITIOUS ARCHITECTS WHO BY A LAVISH AND IMPROVIDENT EXPENDITURE OF PUBLIC MONEY
LJ005-0068 SOUGHT TO RANK THE PRISONS THEY BUILT AMONG THE MOST SPLENDID BUILDINGS OF THE CITY OR TOWN
LJ005-0069 ABSENCE OF EMBELLISHMENT IS IN PERFECT UNISON WITH THE CHARACTER OF THE ESTABLISHMENT
LJ005-0070 THESE ARE PRINCIPLES FULLY RECOGNIZED NOWADAYS AND IT MAY FAIRLY BE CONCEDED THAT THE PRISON DISCIPLINE SOCIETY'S IDEAL
LJ005-0071 DIFFERED LITTLE FROM THAT KEPT IN VIEW IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE LATEST AND BEST MODERN JAILS
LJ005-0072 AFTER A FEW YEARS OF ACTIVE EXERTION THE SOCIETY WAS REWARDED BY FRESH LEGISLATION
LJ005-0073 TO ITS EFFORTS AND THEIR EFFECT UPON PARLIAMENT AND THE PUBLIC MIND WE MUST ATTRIBUTE THE NEW JAIL ACTS OF 4 GEORGE IV
LJ005-0074 CAP. 64 AND 5 GEORGE IV. CAP. 85
LJ005-0075 WHICH HAVING GONE THROUGH SEVERAL SESSIONS AT LAST BECAME LAW IN 1823 TO 4
LJ005-0076 BY THE PREAMBLE OF THE FIRSTNAMED ACT IT WAS DECLARED
LJ005-0077 EXPEDIENT TO INTRODUCE SUCH MEASURES AND ARRANGEMENTS AS SHALL NOT ONLY PROVIDE FOR THE SAFE CUSTODY
LJ005-0078 BUT SHALL ALSO TEND MORE EFFECTUALLY TO PRESERVE THE HEALTH
LJ005-0079 AND IMPROVE THE MORALS OF THE PRISONERS AND SHALL INSURE THE PROPER MEASURE OF PUNISHMENT TO CONVICTED OFFENDERS
LJ005-0080 ACCORDINGLY DUE PROVISION WAS MADE FOR THE ENFORCEMENT OF HARD LABOR ON ALL PRISONERS SENTENCED TO IT AND FOR THE EMPLOYMENT OF ALL OTHERS
LJ005-0082 UNLESS SUCH ABILITY TO WORK SHOULD CEASE BY REASON OF SICKNESS INFIRMITY THE WANT OF SUFFICIENT WORK OR FROM ANY OTHER CAUSE
LJ005-0083 IT WAS DISTINCTLY LAID DOWN THAT MALE AND FEMALE PRISONERS SHOULD BE CONFINED IN SEPARATE BUILDINGS OR PARTS OF THE PRISON
LJ005-0084 SO AS TO PREVENT THEM FROM SEEING CONVERSING OR HOLDING ANY INTERCOURSE WITH EACH OTHER
LJ005-0085 CLASSIFICATION WAS INSISTED UPON IN THE MANNER LAID DOWN BY THE 24 GEORGE III. CAP. 54
LJ005-0086 WITH SUCH FURTHER SEPARATION AS THE JUSTICES SHOULD DEEM CONDUCIVE TO GOOD ORDER AND DISCIPLINE
LJ005-0087 FEMALE PRISONERS WERE IN ALL CASES TO BE UNDER THE CHARGE OF FEMALE OFFICERS
LJ005-0088 EVERY PRISON CONTAINING FEMALE PRISONERS WAS TO HAVE A MATRON WHO WAS TO RESIDE CONSTANTLY IN THE PRISON
LJ005-0089 THE RELIGIOUS AND MORAL WELFARE OF THE PRISONERS WERE TO BE ATTENDED TO
LJ005-0090 THE FIRST BY DAILY SERVICES THE LATTER BY THE APPOINTMENT OF SCHOOLMASTERS AND INSTRUCTION IN READING AND WRITING
LJ005-0091 LAST BUT NOT LEAST THE USE OF IRONS WAS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN EXCEPT IN CASES OF URGENT AND ABSOLUTE NECESSITY
LJ005-0092 AND EVERY PRISONER WAS TO BE PROVIDED WITH A HAMMOCK OR COT TO HIMSELF SUITABLE BEDDING AND IF POSSIBLE A SEPARATE CELL
LJ005-0093 THE SECOND ACT PASSED IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR ENLARGED AND AMENDED THE FIRST AND AT THE SAME TIME GAVE POWERS TO THE HOUSE
LJ005-0094 TO CALL FOR INFORMATION AS TO THE OBSERVANCE OF ITS PROVISIONS
LJ005-0095 THE PROMULGATION OF THESE TWO JAIL ACTS STRENGTHENED THE HANDS OF THE PRISON DISCIPLINE SOCIETY ENORMOUSLY
LJ005-0096 IT HAD NOW A LEGAL AND AUTHORITATIVE STANDARD OF EFFICIENCY TO APPLY
LJ005-0097 AND COULD EXPOSE ALL THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES THAT STILL LAGGED BEHIND OR NEGLECTED TO COMPLY WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE NEW LAWS
LJ005-0098 THE SOCIETY DID NOT SHRINK FROM ITS SELFIMPOSED DUTY BUT CONTINUED YEAR AFTER YEAR WITH UNFLAGGING ENERGY AND UNFLINCHING SPIRIT TO WATCH CLOSELY
LJ005-0099 AND REPORT AT LENGTH UPON THE CONDITION OF THE PRISONS OF THE COUNTRY
LJ005-0100 FOR THIS PURPOSE IT KEPT UP AN EXTENSIVE CORRESPONDENCE WITH ALL PARTS OF THE KINGDOM AND CIRCULATED QUERIES TO BE ANSWERED IN DETAIL
LJ005-0101 WHENCE IT DEDUCED THE PRACTICE AND CONDITION OF EVERY PRISON THAT REPLIED
LJ005-0102 UPON THESE AND THE PRIVATE VISITATIONS MADE BY VARIOUS MEMBERS THE SOCIETY OBTAINED THE FACTS
LJ005-0103 OFTEN HIGHLY DAMNATORY WHICH WERE EMBODIED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORTS
LJ005-0104 THE PROGRESS OF IMPROVEMENT WAS CERTAINLY EXTREMELY SLOW
LJ005-0105 IT WAS LONG BEFORE THE MANY JURISDICTIONS IMITATED THE FEW
LJ005-0106 JAILS OF WHICH THE OLD PRISON AT READING WAS A SPECIMEN WERE STILL LEFT INTACT
LJ005-0107 IN THAT PRISON WITH ITS CELLS AND YARDS ARRANGED WITHIN THE SHELL OF AN ANCIENT ABBEY CHAPEL
LJ005-0108 THE PRISONERS WITHOUT FIRING BEDDING OR SUFFICIENT FOOD SPENT THEIR DAYS IN SURVEYING THEIR GROTESQUE PRISON
LJ005-0109 OR CONTRIVING SOME MEANS OF ESCAPE BY CLIMBING THE FLUTED COLUMNS WHICH SUPPORTED THE GOTHIC ARCHES OF THE AISLES
LJ005-0110 AND SO PASSING BY THE ROOF DOWN INTO THE GARDEN AND ON TO FREEDOM
LJ005-0111 IN A COUNTY PRISON ADJOINING THE METROPOLIS THE SEPARATION BETWEEN THE MALE AND FEMALE QUARTERS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THE ERECTION OF AN IRON RAILING
LJ005-0112 IN THIS SAME PRISON CAPITAL CONVICTS WERE CHAINED TO THE FLOOR UNTIL EXECUTION
LJ005-0113 IN ANOTHER JAIL NOT FAR OFF MALE AND FEMALE FELONS STILL OCCUPIED THE SAME ROOM  UNDERGROUND AND REACHED BY A LADDER OF TEN STEPS
LJ005-0114 IN OTHERS THE SEPARATION BETWEEN THE SEXES CONSISTED IN A HANGING CURTAIN
LJ005-0115 OR AN IMAGINARY BOUNDARY LINE AND NOTHING PREVENTED PARTIES FROM PASSING TO EITHER SIDE
LJ005-0116 BUT AN EMPTY REGULATION WHICH ALL SO DISPOSED COULD DEFY
LJ005-0117 NUMBERS OF THE JAILS WERE STILL UNPROVIDED WITH CHAPLAINS AND THE PRISONERS NEVER HEARD DIVINE SERVICE
LJ005-0118 IN MANY OTHERS THERE WERE NO INFIRMARIES NO PLACES SET APART FOR THE CONFINEMENT OF PRISONERS AFFLICTED WITH DANGEROUS AND INFECTIOUS DISORDERS
LJ005-0119 NO ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO MAINTAIN DISCIPLINE
LJ005-0120 HALF THE JAILS HAD NO CODE OF RULES PROPERLY PREPARED AND SANCTIONED BY THE JUDGES ACCORDING TO LAW
LJ005-0121 BY DEGREES HOWEVER
LJ005-0122 THE CHANGES NECESSARY TO BRING THE PRISONS INTO CONFORMITY WITH THE RECENT ACTS WERE ATTEMPTED IF NOT ACTUALLY INTRODUCED INTO THE COUNTY PRISONS TO WHICH
LJ005-0123 WITH A FEW OF THE MORE IMPORTANT CITY OR BOROUGH PRISONS THESE ACTS MORE ESPECIALLY APPLIED
LJ005-0124 MOST OF THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES EMBARKED INTO CONSIDERABLE EXPENDITURE DETERMINED TO REBUILD THEIR JAILS DE NOVO ON THE MOST APPROVED PATTERN
LJ005-0125 OR TO REAPPROPRIATE RECONSTRUCT AND PATCH UP THE EXISTING PRISONS TILL THEY WERE MORE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GROWING REQUIREMENTS OF THE TIMES
LJ005-0126 RELIGIOUS WORSHIP BECAME MORE GENERALLY THE RULE CHAPLAINS WERE APPOINTED AND CHAPELS PROVIDED FOR THEM SURGEONS AND HOSPITALS ALSO
LJ005-0127 WORKSHOPS WERE BUILT AT MANY PRISONS VARIOUS KINDS OF MANUFACTURES AND TRADES WERE SET ON FOOT INCLUDING WEAVING MATTING SHOEMAKING AND TAILORING
LJ005-0128 THE INTERIOR OF ONE PRISON WAS ILLUMINATED THROUGHOUT WITH GAS  STILL A NOVELTY WHICH HAD BEEN GENERALLY ADOPTED IN LONDON ONLY FOUR YEARS PREVIOUSLY
LJ005-0129 A MEASURE WHICH MUST GREATLY TEND TO DISCOURAGE ATTEMPTS TO ESCAPE
LJ005-0130 THERE WERE TREADWHEELS AT MOST OF THE PRISONS AND REGULAR EMPLOYMENT THEREON OR AT SOME OTHER KIND OF HARD LABOR
LJ005-0131 IN MANY PLACES TOO WHERE THE PRISONERS EARNED MONEY BY THEIR WORK THEY WERE GRANTED A PORTION OF IT FOR THEIR OWN USE AFTER PROPER DEDUCTION FOR MAINTENANCE
LJ005-0132 ONLY A FEW GLARING EVILS STILL DEMANDED A REMEDY
LJ005-0133 THE PROVISION OF SEPARATE SLEEPING CELLS WAS STILL QUITE INADEQUATE FOR INSTANCE
LJ005-0134 IN TWENTYTWO COUNTY JAILS THERE WERE 1063 SLEEPING CELLS IN ALL IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY THREE
LJ005-0135 AND THE AVERAGE DAILY NUMBER COMMITTED THAT YEAR AMOUNTED TO 3985
LJ005-0136 THE WANT OF SLEEPING CELLS LONG CONTINUED A CRYING NEED
LJ005-0137 FOUR YEARS LATER THE PRISON SOCIETY REPORTED
LJ005-0138 THAT IN FOUR PRISONS WHICH AT ONE TIME OF THE YEAR CONTAINED 1308 PRISONERS THERE WERE ONLY SIXTYEIGHT SLEEPING ROOMS OR CELLS
LJ005-0139 MAKING AN AVERAGE OF NINETEEN PERSONS OCCUPYING EACH ROOM
LJ005-0140 AT THE NEW PRISON CLERKENWELL WHICH HAD BECOME THE PRINCIPAL RECEPTION JAIL OF MIDDLESEX AND SO TOOK ALL THE UNTRIED
LJ005-0141 THE SLEEPING SPACE PER HEAD WAS ONLY SIXTEEN INCHES AND OFTEN AS MANY AS 293 MEN HAD TO BE ACCOMMODATED ON BARRACK BEDS
LJ005-0142 OCCUPYING BARELY 390 FEET LINEAL
LJ005-0143 THE SCENES OF TUMULT AND OBSCENITY IN THESE NIGHT ROOMS ARE SAID TO HAVE BEEN BEYOND DESCRIPTION A PRISONER IN ONE NOCTURNAL RIOT LOST AN EYE
LJ005-0144 YET TO CLERKENWELL WERE NOW COMMITTED THE JUVENILES AND ALL WHO WERE INEXPERIENCED IN CRIME
LJ005-0145 GREAT WANT OF UNIFORMITY IN TREATMENT IN THE VARIOUS PRISONS WAS STILL NOTICEABLE
LJ005-0146 AND WAS INDEED DESTINED TO CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER HALF CENTURY IN OTHER WORDS UNTIL THE INTRODUCTION OF THE PRISON ACT OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN
LJ005-0147 AT THE TIME OF WHICH I AM WRITING THERE WAS GREAT DIVERSITY OF PRACTICE AS REGARDS THE HOURS OF LABOR
LJ005-0148 IN SOME PRISONS THE PRISONERS WORKED SEVEN HOURS A DAY IN OTHERS TEN AND TEN AND A HALF
LJ005-0149 THE NATURE OF THE EMPLOYMENT VARIED GREATLY IN SEVERITY ESPECIALLY THE TREADWHEEL LABOR
LJ005-0150 IN SOME COUNTY JAILS AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID FEMALE PRISONERS WERE PLACED UPON THE TREADWHEEL
LJ005-0151 IN OTHERS WOMEN WERE VERY PROPERLY EXEMPTED FROM IT AND ALSO FROM ALL SEVERE LABOR
LJ005-0152 EARNINGS WERE VERY DIFFERENTLY APPROPRIATED. HERE THE PRISONERS WERE GIVEN THE WHOLE AMOUNT THERE A HALF OR A THIRD
LJ005-0153 SOMETIMES THIS MONEY MIGHT BE EXPENDED IN THE PURCHASE OF EXTRA ARTICLES OF FOOD
LJ005-0154 THE RATIONS VARIED CONSIDERABLY EVERYWHERE
LJ005-0155 IT WAS STILL LIMITED TO BREAD IN SOME PLACES THE ALLOWANCE OF WHICH VARIED FROM ONE TO THREE POUNDS
LJ005-0156 IN OTHERS MEAT SOUP GRUEL BEER WERE GIVEN
LJ005-0157 HERE AND THERE FOOD WAS NOT ISSUED IN KIND BUT A MONEY ALLOWANCE WHICH THE PRISONER MIGHT EXPEND HIMSELF
LJ005-0158 BEDDING AND CLOTHING WAS STILL DENIED BUT ONLY IN A FEW JAILS
LJ005-0159 IN OTHERS BOTH WERE SUPPLIED IN AMPLE QUANTITIES THE COST VARYING PER PRISONER FROM TWENTY SHILLINGS TO FIVE POUNDS
LJ005-0160 IT WAS PLAIN THAT ALTHOUGH THE LAW HAD DEFINED GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PRISON GOVERNMENT
LJ005-0161 TOO MUCH DISCRETION WAS STILL LEFT TO THE MAGISTRACY TO FILL IN THE DETAILS. THE LEGISLATURE ONLY RECOMMENDED
LJ005-0162 IT DID NOT PEREMPTORILY INSIST. TOO OFTEN THE LETTER OF THE LAW WAS OBSERVED BUT NOT ITS SPIRIT
LJ005-0163 ONE GREAT IMPEDIMENT TO WIDE AMELIORATION WAS THAT A VAST NUMBER OF SMALL JAILS LAY OUT OF REACH OF THE LAW
LJ005-0164 WHEN THE NEW ACTS WERE INTRODUCED NUMEROUS PRISONS UNDER LOCAL JURISDICTION WERE EXEMPTED FROM THE OPERATION OF THE LAW
LJ005-0165 THEY WERE SO RADICALLY BAD THAT REFORM SEEMED HOPELESS AND IT WAS THOUGHT WISER NOT TO BRING THEM UNDER PROVISIONS WHICH CLEARLY COULD NOT BE ENFORCED
LJ005-0166 MR. PEEL WHO AS HOME SECRETARY HAD CHARGE OF THE BILL
LJ005-0167 WHICH BECAME THE 4 GEORGE IV. CAP. 64 SAID THAT HE HAD ABSTAINED FROM LEGISLATING FOR THESE SMALL JURISDICTIONS ON MATURE DELIBERATION
LJ005-0168 IT IS NOT HE SAID THAT I AM INSENSIBLE OF THE LAMENTABLE AND DISGRACEFUL SITUATION IN WHICH MANY OF THEM ARE
LJ005-0169 BUT I INDULGE A HOPE THAT MANY OF THEM WILL CONTRACT WITH THE COUNTIES
LJ005-0170 THAT MANY OF THEM WILL BUILD NEW JAILS AND THAT WHEN IN A YEAR OR TWO WE COME TO EXAMINE THEIR SITUATION
LJ005-0171 WE SHALL FIND BUT FEW WHICH HAVE NOT IN ONE OR OTHER OF THESE WAYS REMOVED THE GRIEVANCE OF WHICH SUCH JUST COMPLAINT IS MADE
LJ005-0172 WHEN THAT TIME ARRIVES
LJ005-0173 I SHALL NOT HESITATE TO ASK PARLIAMENT FOR POWERS TO COMPEL THEM TO MAKE THE NECESSARY ALTERATIONS FOR IT IS NOT TO BE ENDURED THAT THESE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS SHOULD REMAIN
LJ005-0174 IN THE DEPLORABLE SITUATION IN WHICH MANY OF THEM NOW ARE
LJ005-0175 AT THIS TIME THERE WERE IN ENGLAND ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY BOROUGHS CITIES TOWNS AND LIBERTIES
LJ005-0176 WHICH POSSESSED THE RIGHT OF TRYING CRIMINALS FOR VARIOUS OFFENSES
LJ005-0177 NEARLY EVERY ONE OF THESE JURISDICTIONS HAD ITS OWN PRISON AND THERE WERE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SUCH JAILS IN ALL
LJ005-0178 MANY OF THEM CONSISTED OF ONE OR TWO ROOMS AT MOST
LJ005-0179 HE TOTAL NUMBER OF PRISONERS THEY RECEIVED DURING THE YEAR VARIED FROM TWO PERSONS TO MANY HUNDREDS
LJ005-0180 IT WAS IN THESE JAILS WITHDRAWN FROM THE PRESSURE OF AUTHORITY THAT THE NEW RULES WERE INVARIABLY IGNORED
LJ005-0181 THE RIGHT AND PRIVILEGE OF THE BOROUGH TO MAINTAIN ITS OWN PLACE OF CONFINEMENT WAS SO ANCIENT AND INDISPUTABLE
LJ005-0182 THAT FOR LONG NO IDEA OF INTERFERING WITH THEM WAS ENTERTAINED
LJ005-0183 ALL THAT WAS URGED WAS THAT THE BOROUGH MAGISTRACY HAD NO RIGHT TO GOVERN THEIR JAILS
LJ005-0184 SO AS TO CORRUPT THOSE COMMITTED TO THE INJURY OF THE PEACE AND MORALS OF THE PUBLIC
LJ005-0185 AS TIME PASSED HOWEVER THESE MAGISTRATES MADE NO EFFORT AT REFORM
LJ005-0186 THEY NEITHER BUILT NEW JAILS NOR CONTRACTED WITH THE COUNTIES AS HAD BEEN EXPECTED FOR THE TRANSFER OF THEIR PRISONERS
LJ005-0187 AS THE SOCIETY PUT IT IN 1827 THE FRIENDS TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF PRISON DISCIPLINE WILL REGRET TO LEARN
LJ005-0188 THAT THE JAILS ATTACHED TO CORPORATE JURISDICTIONS CONTINUE TO BE THE FRUITFUL SOURCES
LJ005-0189 OF VICE AND MISERY DEBASING ALL WHO ARE CONFINED WITHIN THEIR WALLS AND DISSEMINATING THROUGH THEIR RESPECTIVE COMMUNITIES
LJ005-0190 THE KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICE OF EVERY SPECIES OF CRIMINALITY
LJ005-0191 THE SOCIETY PROCEEDED TO SUPPORT THIS INDICTMENT BY FACTS IT IS MUCH THE OLD STORY
LJ005-0192 THE PRISONERS WERE LODGED IN ROOMS WHENCE THEY COULD CONVERSE WITH PASSENGERS IN THE STREETS AND FREELY OBTAIN SPIRITS AND OTHER PROHIBITED ARTICLES
LJ005-0193 ALL DESCRIPTIONS OF OFFENDERS CONGREGATED TOGETHER IN THE FELONS' WARDS
LJ005-0194 THE KEEPER AND HIS OFFICERS RESIDED AT A DISTANCE FROM THE JAIL AND LEFT ITS INMATES TO THEIR OWN DEVICES
LJ005-0195 THERE WAS NO DECENCY WHATEVER IN THE INTERNAL ARRANGEMENTS
LJ005-0196 STILL NO SEPARATION OF THE SEXES NO MEANS OF ABLUTION OR OTHER NECESSARY SERVICES
LJ005-0197 ONE BOROUGH PRISON CONSISTED OF NOTHING MORE THAN A COUPLE OF CELLS ABOUT TEN YARDS SQUARE AND ABSOLUTELY NOTHING MORE
LJ005-0198 IN ANOTHER BOROUGH WITH A POPULATION OF TEN THOUSAND THE PRISON WAS OF THE SAME DIMENSIONS
LJ005-0199 ONE CELL WAS A DUNGEON AND THE OTHER AN IMPROPER AND UNHEALTHY ABODE FOR ANY HUMAN BEING WITH A WATERCOURSE RUNNING THROUGH IT
LJ005-0200 MOST OF THESE SMALL JAILS WERE STILL IN EXISTENCE AND IN MUCH THE SAME STATE EIGHT YEARS LATER
LJ005-0201 AS IS SHOWN BY THE REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONERS TO INQUIRE INTO THE STATE OF THE MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS IN 1835
LJ005-0202 AN EXAMINATION OF THIS REPORT SHOWS HOW EVEN THE MOST INSIGNIFICANT TOWNSHIP HAD ITS JAIL
LJ005-0203 THUS DINAS MWDDY IN MERIONETHSHIRE HAD BESIDES THE PINFOLD AND THE STOCKS OR CRIB A LITTLE PRISON
LJ005-0204 CLUN IN SHROPSHIRE HAD A LOCKUP UNDER THE TOWN HALL
LJ005-0205 AT EYE IN SUFFOLK THE JAIL WAS PART OF THE POORHOUSE SO IT WAS AT RICHMOND IN YORKSHIRE WHERE THE MASTER OF THE WORKHOUSE WAS ALSO KEEPER OF THE JAIL
LJ005-0206 AT GODMANCHESTER THERE WAS NO JAIL BUT A CAGE TO SECURE PRISONERS TILL THEY COULD BE TAKEN BEFORE A MAGISTRATE
LJ005-0207 KIDDERMINSTER HAD A PRISON ONE DAMP CHILL ROOM
LJ005-0208 THE ONLY APERTURE THROUGH WHICH AIR COULD BE ADMITTED BEING AN IRON GRATING LEVEL WITH THE STREET
LJ005-0209 THROUGH THE BARS OF WHICH QUILLS OR REEDS WERE INSERTED AND DRINK CONVEYED TO THE PRISONERS
LJ005-0210 AT WALSALL IN STAFFORDSHIRE
LJ005-0211 THE JAIL CONSISTED OF SIX CELLS FREQUENTLY SO DAMP THAT THE MOISTURE TRICKLED DOWN THE WALLS THERE WAS NOT SPACE FOR AIR OR EXERCISE
LJ005-0212 AND THE PRISON ALLOWANCE WAS STILL LIMITED TO BREAD AND WATER
LJ005-0213 NEWGATE THROUGH ALL THESE YEARS CONTINUED A BYEWORD WITH THE SOCIETY
LJ005-0214 SOME REFORMS HAD CERTAINLY BEEN INTRODUCED SUCH AS THE ABOLITION OF IRONS ALREADY REFERRED TO AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MALE AND FEMALE INFIRMARIES
LJ005-0215 THE REGULAR DAILY VISITATION OF THE CHAPLAIN WAS ALSO INSISTED UPON
LJ005-0216 BUT IT WAS POINTED OUT IN 1823 THAT DEFECTIVE CONSTRUCTION MUST ALWAYS BAR THE WAY TO ANY RADICAL IMPROVEMENT IN NEWGATE
LJ005-0217 WITHOUT ENLARGEMENT NO MATERIAL CHANGE IN DISCIPLINE OR INTERIOR ECONOMY COULD POSSIBLY BE INTRODUCED
LJ005-0218 THE CHAPEL STILL CONTINUED INCOMMODIOUS AND INSUFFICIENT
LJ005-0219 FEMALE PRISONERS WERE STILL EXPOSED TO THE FULL VIEW OF THE MALES THE NETTING IN FRONT OF THE GALLERY BEING PERFECTLY USELESS AS A SCREEN
LJ005-0220 IN 1824 NEWGATE HAD NO GLASS IN ITS WINDOWS EXCEPT IN THE INFIRMARY AND ONE WARD OF THE CHAPEL YARD
LJ005-0221 AND THE PANES WERE FILLED IN WITH OILED PAPER AN INSUFFICIENT PROTECTION AGAINST THE WEATHER
LJ005-0222 AND AS THE WINDOWFRAMES WOULD NOT SHUT TIGHT THE PRISONERS COMPLAINED MUCH OF THE COLD ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT
LJ005-0223 THERE WAS A DIMINUTION IN THE NUMBERS IN CUSTODY DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF THE PRACTICE OF NOT COMMITTING AT ONCE TO NEWGATE EVERY OFFENDER FOR TRIAL AT THE OLD BAILEY
LJ005-0224 BUT NOTHING HAD BEEN DONE TO IMPROVE THE PRISON BUILDINGS
LJ005-0225 IN 1827 THE SOCIETY WAS COMPELLED TO REPORT THAT NO MATERIAL CHANGE HAD TAKEN PLACE IN NEWGATE SINCE THE PASSING OF THE PRISON LAWS
LJ005-0226 AND THAT CONSEQUENTLY THE OBSERVANCE OF THEIR MOST IMPORTANT PROVISIONS WAS HABITUALLY NEGLECTED
LJ005-0227 IT WAS ENACTED THAT THE COURT OF ALDERMEN SHOULD MAKE RULES FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PRISON AND THAT THESE SHOULD BE POSTED PUBLICLY WITHIN THE WALLS
LJ005-0228 AS YET NO RULES OR REGULATIONS HAD BEEN PRINTED OR PREPARED
LJ005-0229 BY ANOTHER CLAUSE OF THE JAIL ACT TWO JUSTICES WERE TO BE APPOINTED TO VISIT THE PRISON AT LEAST THRICE IN EVERY QUARTER AND OFTENER IF OCCASION REQUIRED
LJ005-0230 THESE JUSTICES WERE TO INSPECT EVERY PART OF THE PRISON AND EXAMINE INTO THE STATE AND CONDITION OF PRISONERS
LJ005-0231 THE CITY JUSTICES HAD NOT FULFILLED THIS OBLIGATION
LJ005-0232 IDLENESS WAS STILL THE GENERAL RULE FOR ALL PRISONERS IN NEWGATE IN DEFIANCE OF THE LAW
LJ005-0233 THERE WAS NO INSTRUCTION OF ADULT PRISONERS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW. THE SLEEPING ACCOMMODATION WAS STILL ALTOGETHER CONTRARY TO THE LATEST IDEAS
LJ005-0234 THE VISITS OF FRIENDS WAS ONCE MORE UNRESERVEDLY ALLOWED AND THESE INCOMERS FREELY BROUGHT IN EXTRA PROVISIONS AND BEER
LJ005-0235 LAST AND WORST OF ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR KEEPING THE CONDEMNED PRISONERS BETWEEN SENTENCE AND EXECUTION WERE MORE THAN UNSATISFACTORY
LJ005-0236 THEY WERE NOT CONFINED APART FROM EACH OTHER BUT WERE CROWDED THIRTY OR FORTY TOGETHER IN THE PRESS YARD
LJ005-0237 SO THAT CORRUPT CONVERSATION OBLITERATED FROM THE MIND OF HIM WHO IS DOOMED TO SUFFER EVERY SERIOUS FEELING AND VALUABLE IMPRESSION
LJ005-0238 I SHALL HAVE MORE TO SAY ON THIS SUBJECT AND UPON THE STATE OF NEWGATE GENERALLY IN THE FOLLOWING CHAPTER
LJ005-0239 THE PRISON SOCIETY DID NOT RELAX ITS EFFORTS AS TIME PASSED BUT ITS LEADING MEMBERS HAD OTHER AND MORE PRESSING CLAIMS UPON THEIR ENERGIES
LJ005-0240 MR. BUXTON HAD SUCCEEDED TO THE GREAT WORK WHICH WILLIAM WILBERFORCE HAD COMMENCED AND LED THE REPEATED ATTACKS UPON SLAVERY IN BRITISH COLONIES
LJ005-0241 TILL THE WHOLE BODY OF THE SLAVES WERE MANUMITTED IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY THREE
LJ005-0242 IN THE YEAR IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THIS PARLIAMENT WAS TOO BUSY WITH THE GREAT QUESTION OF ITS OWN REFORM TO SPARE MUCH TIME FOR DOMESTIC LEGISLATION
LJ005-0243 NEVERTHELESS A COMMITTEE OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WAS APPOINTED IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY ONE TO REPORT UPON THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF SECONDARY PUNISHMENTS
LJ005-0244 WHICH DEALT WITH JAILS OF ALL CLASSES AS WELL AS TRANSPORTATION
LJ005-0245 THIS COMMITTEE ANIMADVERTED STRONGLY UPON THE SYSTEM IN FORCE AT THE METROPOLITAN JAILS AND MORE ESPECIALLY UPON THE CONDITION OF NEWGATE
LJ005-0246 WHERE PRISONERS BEFORE AND AFTER TRIAL ARE UNDER NO EFFICIENT SUPERINTENDENCE AND WHERE THERE WAS NO RESTRAINT OR ATTEMPT AT RESTRAINT
LJ005-0247 MR. SAMUEL HOARE WAS EXAMINED BY THIS COMMITTEE
LJ005-0248 AND STATED THAT IN HIS OPINION NEWGATE AS THE COMMON JAIL OF MIDDLESEX WAS WHOLLY INADEQUATE TO THE PROPER CONFINEMENT OF ITS PRISONERS
LJ005-0249 FROM THE MOMENT OF A PERSON'S COMMITTAL HE WAS CERTAIN TO BE PLUNGED DEEPER AND DEEPER IN GUILT
LJ005-0250 THE PRISONERS WERE CROWDED TOGETHER IN THE JAIL CONTRARY TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE 4 GEORGE IV
LJ005-0251 AGAIN IN 1835 PRISONS AND THEIR INMATES BECAME ONCE MORE THE CARE OF THE SENATE AND THE SUBJECT WAS TAKEN UP THIS TIME BY THE HOUSE OF LORDS
LJ005-0252 A COMMITTEE WAS APPOINTED UNDER THE PRESIDENCY OF THE DUKE OF RICHMOND
LJ005-0253 TO INQUIRE INTO AND REPORT UPON THE SEVERAL JAILS AND HOUSES OF CORRECTION IN THE COUNTIES CITIES AND CORPORATE TOWNS WITHIN ENGLAND AND WALES
LJ005-0254 UPON THE RULES AND DISCIPLINE THEREIN ESTABLISHED WITH REGARD TO THE TREATMENT OF UNCONVICTED AS WELL AS CONVICTED PERSONS
LJ005-0255 THE COMMITTEE WAS ALSO TO REPORT UPON THE MANNER IN WHICH SENTENCES WERE CARRIED OUT AND TO RECOMMEND ANY ALTERATIONS NECESSARY IN THE RULES
LJ005-0256 IN ORDER TO INSURE UNIFORMITY OF DISCIPLINE. IT MET ON THE 31ST MARCH 1835 AND CONTINUED ITS SITTINGS WELL INTO JULY
LJ005-0257 DURING WHICH TIME A HOST OF WITNESSES WERE EXAMINED AND THE COMMITTEE PRESENTED THREE SEPARATE REPORTS
LJ005-0258 EMBODYING RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH MAY BE SAID TO HAVE FORMED THE BASIS OF MODERN PRISON MANAGEMENT
LJ005-0259 IT WAS LAID DOWN AS A FIRST AND INDISPENSABLE PRINCIPLE THAT UNIFORMITY OF DISCIPLINE SHOULD PREVAIL EVERYWHERE
LJ005-0260 A THEORY WHICH DID NOT BECOME A PRACTICAL FACT FOR FORTY MORE YEARS
LJ005-0261 AS A MEANS OF SECURING THIS UNIFORMITY
LJ005-0262 IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT THE RULES FRAMED FOR PRISON GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE SUBJECTED TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR APPROVAL
LJ005-0263 AND NOT AS HERETOFORE TO THE JUDGES OF ASSIZE THAT BOTH TO CHECK ABUSES AND WATCH THE PROGRESS OF IMPROVEMENT
LJ005-0264 INSPECTORS OF PRISONS SHOULD BE APPOINTED WHO SHOULD VISIT ALL THE PRISONS FROM TIME TO TIME AND REPORT TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE
LJ005-0265 IT WAS RECOMMENDED THAT THE DIETARIES SHOULD BE SUBMITTED AND APPROVED LIKE THE RULES THAT CONVICTED PRISONERS SHOULD NOT RECEIVE ANY FOOD BUT THE JAIL ALLOWANCE
LJ005-0266 THAT FOOD AND FUEL SHOULD BE ISSUED IN KIND AND NEVER PROVIDED BY THE PRISONERS THEMSELVES OUT OF MONIES GRANTED THEM
LJ005-0267 THE USE OF TOBACCO HITHERTO PRETTY GENERALLY INDULGED IN BOTH BY MEN AND WOMEN
LJ005-0268 SHOULD BE STRICTLY PROHIBITED AS A STIMULATING LUXURY INCONSISTENT WITH ANY NOTION OF STRICT DISCIPLINE AND THE DUE PRESSURE OF JUST PUNISHMENT
LJ005-0269 PRISON OFFICERS SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY SHARE IN PRISONERS' EARNINGS
LJ005-0270 WHICH SHOULD BE PAID INTO GENERAL PRISON FUNDS AND NO PART OF THEM HANDED OVER TO THE PRISONERS THEMSELVES
LJ005-0271 AS A MEANS OF INCREASING THE SEVERITY OF IMPRISONMENT LETTERS AND VISITS FROM OUTSIDE SHOULD NOT BE PERMITTED DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF AN IMPRISONMENT
LJ005-0272 VARIOUS OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS WERE MADE AS REGARDS THE APPOINTMENT OF CHAPLAIN AND SCHOOLMASTERS THE LIMITATION OF THE POWERS OF WARDSMEN
LJ005-0273 OR PRISONERS EMPLOYED IN POSITIONS OF TRUST WHO SHOULD NOT BE PERMITTED TO TRAFFIC WITH THEIR FELLOWPRISONERS IN ANY WAY
LJ005-0274 THE COMMITTEE MOST OF ALL INSISTED UPON THE ENTIRE INDIVIDUAL SEPARATION OF PRISONERS EXCEPT DURING THE HOURS OF LABOR
LJ005-0275 RELIGIOUS WORSHIP AND INSTRUCTION AS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR PREVENTING CONTAMINATION
LJ005-0276 AND FOR SECURING A PROPER SYSTEM OF PRISON DISCIPLINE
LJ005-0277 THIS WAS THE FIRST ENUNCIATION OF THE SYSTEM OF SEPARATE CONFINEMENT
LJ005-0278 WHICH WAS EVENTUALLY TO REPLACE THE ATTEMPTED ARRANGEMENT OF PRISONERS BY CLASSES ACCORDING TO ANTECEDENTS AND CRIMES
LJ005-0279 AN INCOMPLETE AND FALLACIOUS METHOD OF PREVENTING CONTAMINATION
LJ005-0280 THE LORDS' COMMITTEE FULLY RECOGNIZED THE PAINFUL FACT
LJ005-0281 THAT THE GREATEST MISCHIEF FOLLOWED FROM THE INTERCOURSE WHICH WAS STILL PERMITTED IN SO MANY PRISONS TO USE ITS WORDS
LJ005-0282 THE COMPARATIVELY INNOCENT ARE SEDUCED THE UNWARY ARE ENTRAPPED
LJ005-0283 AND THE TENDENCY TO CRIME IN OFFENDERS NOT ENTIRELY HARDENED IS CONFIRMED BY THE LANGUAGE THE SUGGESTIONS AND THE EXAMPLE
LJ005-0284 OF MORE DEPRAVED AND SYSTEMATIC CRIMINALS
LJ005-0285 THIS COMMITTEE AS WELL AS THE ONE PRECEDING IT ALSO REPORTED IN TERMS OF STRONG REPROBATION ON THE SMALL PRISONS AND JAILS
LJ005-0286 STILL UNDER THE BOROUGH CORPORATIONS. THE COMMONS' COMMITTEE GAVE IT AS THEIR OPINION THAT THEY WERE IN A DEPLORABLE STATE
LJ005-0287 THE SAME LANGUAGE WAS USED BY THE COMMISSIONERS APPOINTED TO INQUIRE INTO THE MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS IN 1835
LJ005-0288 WHEN SPEAKING MORE PARTICULARLY OF THE BOROUGH JAILS
LJ005-0289 IN THESE THE COMMISSIONERS FOUND ADDITIONAL PROOF OF THE EVILS OF CONTINUING THE PRESENT CONSTITUTION OF THE LOCAL TRIBUNALS
LJ005-0290 INSTANCES RARELY OCCUR IN WHICH THE BOROUGH JAILS ADMIT OF ANY PROPER CLASSIFICATION OF THE PRISONERS
LJ005-0291 IN SOME LARGE TOWNS AS AT BERWICK ON TWEED SOUTHAMPTON AND SOUTHWARK THEY THE PRISONS ARE IN A VERY DISCREDITABLE CONDITION
LJ005-0292 IN MANY OF THE SMALLER BOROUGHS THEY ARE TOTALLY UNFIT FOR THE CONFINEMENT OF HUMAN BEINGS
LJ005-0293 IN THESE PLACES THE PRISONERS ARE OFTEN WITHOUT A PROPER SUPPLY OF AIR AND LIGHT FREQUENTLY THE JAILS ARE MERE DUNGEONS UNDER THE TOWN HALL
LJ005-0294 IT WAS FREQUENTLY STATED IN EVIDENCE THAT THE JAIL OF THE BOROUGH WAS IN SO UNFIT A STATE FOR THE RECEPTION OF PRISONERS
LJ005-0295 THAT PLAINTIFFS WERE UNWILLING TO CONSIGN THE DEFENDANTS AGAINST WHOM THEY HAD OBTAINED EXECUTION TO CONFINEMENT WITHIN ITS WALLS
LJ005-0296 THE LORDS' COMMITTEE ON JAILS WERE OF THE SAME OPINION AND CONSIDERED THE PRISONS UNDER CORPORATE OR PECULIAR JURISDICTION IN A VERY UNSATISFACTORY CONDITION
LJ005-0297 THEY THEREFORE RECOMMENDED THAT THE PRISONERS SHOULD BE REMOVED
LJ005-0298 TO THE COUNTY JAILS FROM SUCH PRISONS AS WERE PAST IMPROVEMENT AND THAT THE BOROUGH FUNDS SHOULD BE CHARGED FOR THE ACCOMMODATION
LJ005-0299 THE WHOLE QUESTION WAS AGAIN DEALT WITH IN LORD JOHN RUSSELL'S BILL FOR THE REFORM OF THE MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS AND WITH A MORE LIBERAL ELECTION OF TOWN COUNCILORS
LJ005-0300 AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS UPON A PROPER FOOTING
LJ006-0001 THE CHRONICLES OF NEWGATE VOLUME 2. BY ARTHUR GRIFFITHS. SECTION 9 THE FIRST REPORT OF THE INSPECTOR OF PRISONS
LJ006-0002 IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER I HAVE BEEN TEMPTED BY THE IMPORTANCE OF THE GENERAL QUESTION TO GIVE IT PROMINENCE AND PRECEDENCE OVER THE PARTICULAR BRANCH OF WHICH I AM TREATING
LJ006-0003 NEWGATE HAS REMAINED RATHER IN THE BACKGROUND WHILE THE WHOLE OF THE JAILS AS A BODY WERE UNDER DISCUSSION
LJ006-0004 BUT THIS DIGRESSION WAS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO PRESENT A MORE COMPLETE PICTURE OF THE STATE OF JAILS IN THE EARLY PART OF THE PRESENT CENTURY
LJ006-0005 JUST BEFORE THE PUBLIC MIND WAS FIRST AWAKENED TO THE NEED FOR THOROUGH REFORM
LJ006-0006 I SHALL NOW RETURN TO THE GREAT JAIL OF THE CITY OF LONDON AND GIVE A MORE DETAILED ACCOUNT OF ITS CONDITION AND INNER LIFE
LJ006-0007 AS THE INSPECTORS OF PRISONS FOUND THEM IN 1835 TO 6
LJ006-0008 THESE GENTLEMEN WERE APPOINTED IN OCTOBER 1835 OWING TO THE STRONG REPRESENTATIONS OF THE LORDS' COMMITTEE
LJ006-0009 BACKED UP BY THE EVIDENCE OF SEVERAL INFLUENTIAL WITNESSES
LJ006-0010 MR. SAMUEL HOARE WHEN EXAMINED CONSIDERED IT INDISPENSABLY NECESSARY TO CARRY OUT WHATEVER SYSTEM MIGHT BE ESTABLISHED
LJ006-0011 THAT INSPECTORS SHOULD WATCH OVER THE OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW. HE SAW NO OBJECTION ON THE SCORE OF THEIR PROBABLE INTERFERENCE WITH THE LOCAL JURISDICTION
LJ006-0012 BUT HE WOULD NOT ARM THEM WITH ANY AUTHORITY LEST THEIR COOPERATION MIGHT BE OFFENSIVE
LJ006-0013 SIR FREDERICK ROE WAS OF THE SAME OPINION AS REGARDS THE APPOINTMENT BUT HE WOULD GIVE THE INSPECTORS THE POWER OF ACTING AS WELL AS REPORTING
LJ006-0014 THEY SHOULD BE PERSONS HE THOUGHT SELECTED FROM THE HIGHEST CLASS THE DUTY WAS MOST IMPORTANT
LJ006-0015 ONE WHICH REQUIRED DISCRETION JUDGMENT AND KNOWLEDGE OF LAW WITH SUFFICIENT INSIGHT AND EXPERIENCE TO DISCOVER DEFECTS IN PRISON DISCIPLINE
LJ006-0016 THESE CONSIDERATIONS NO DOUBT HAD WEIGHT
LJ006-0017 WITH THOSE WHO MADE THE SELECTION OF THE FIRST INSPECTORS AND THE TWO GENTLEMEN APPOINTED WERE PROBABLY THE MOST FITTED IN ENGLAND TO BE SO EMPLOYED
LJ006-0018 ONE WAS MR. WILLIAM CRAWFORD THE OTHER THE REV. WHITWORTH RUSSELL
LJ006-0019 THE FIRST NAMED HAD LONG BEEN AN ACTIVE PHILANTHROPIST DEVOTING HIMSELF MORE PARTICULARLY TO THE REFORMATION OF JUVENILE CRIMINALS
LJ006-0020 WILLIAM CRAWFORD HAD BEEN ONE OF THE PROMOTERS AND MANAGERS OF THE PHILANTHROPIC SOCIETY'S FARM SCHOOL
LJ006-0021 LATER ON HE HAD DEVOTED HIMSELF TO THE PERSONAL INVESTIGATION OF THE PRISONS OF THE UNITED STATES
LJ006-0022 AT THAT TIME THE MILD AND INTELLIGENT PRISON DISCIPLINE IN FORCE IN PENNSYLVANIA THE LEGACY OF THE OLD QUAKER IMMIGRANTS
LJ006-0023 HAD MADE SUCH PRISONS AS AUBURN A MODEL FOR IMITATION
LJ006-0024 SEVERAL EUROPEAN STATES HAD DISPATCHED EMISSARIES TO EXAMINE AND REPORT UPON THEM
LJ006-0025 FRANCE HAD SENT MISSEURS BEAUMONT AND DE TOCQUEVILLE WHO SUBSEQUENTLY PUBLISHED SEVERAL INTERESTING WORKS ON THE SUBJECT
LJ006-0026 ENGLAND WAS REPRESENTED BY MR. CRAWFORD AND THE RESULT OF HIS INQUIRY WAS GIVEN TO THE PUBLIC AS AN APPENDIX TO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS' REPORT ON SECONDARY PUNISHMENTS
LJ006-0027 IT IS AN ABLE AND EXHAUSTIVE STATE PAPER TESTIFYING TO THE KEENNESS OF THE WRITER'S PERCEPTION AND HIS UNREMITTING LABOR IN PURSUING HIS RESEARCHES
LJ006-0028 MR. CRAWFORD WAS THOROUGHLY VERSED IN THE STILL IMPERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD SCIENCE OF PRISON MANAGEMENT AND FULLY QUALIFIED FOR HIS NEW DUTIES
LJ006-0029 THE SECOND INSPECTOR THE REV WHITWORTH RUSSELL WAS THE CHAPLAIN OF MILLBANK PENITENTIARY
LJ006-0030 THE GREAT ARCHITECTURAL EXPERIMENT WHICH GREW OUT OF THE STRONG REPRESENTATIONS OF JEREMY BENTHAM AND OTHERS AND WAS THE FIRST NATIONAL RECOGNITION OF THE PRINCIPLE
LJ006-0031 THAT PUNISHMENT MUST BE REFORMATORY AS WELL AS DETERRENT
LJ006-0032 MESSRS. CRAWFORD AND RUSSELL PROCEEDED TO CARRY OUT THEIR NEW FUNCTIONS WITH COMMENDABLE ENERGY AND WITHOUT A MOMENT'S LOSS OF TIME
LJ006-0033 THE INK WAS BARELY DRY UPON THEIR LETTERS OF APPOINTMENT BEFORE THEY APPEARED AT NEWGATE AND COMMENCED A SEARCHING INVESTIGATION
LJ006-0034 THEY ATTENDED EARLY AND LATE THEY MUSTERED THE PRISONERS EXAMINED INTO THEIR CONDITION
LJ006-0035 TOOK VOLUMINOUS EVIDENCE FROM ALL CLASSES OF INDIVIDUALS FROM THE GOVERNOR DOWN TO THE CONVICT IN THE CONDEMNED CELLS
LJ006-0036 THEY VISITED THE WARDS AFTER LOCKINGUP TIME AND SAW WITH THEIR OWN EYES WHAT WENT ON
LJ006-0038 A SUBJECT OF MAGNITUDE AND IMPORTANCE SUFFICIENT TO EXCLUDE OTHER JAILS THEY SOON NARROWED THEIR INQUIRY STILL FURTHER
LJ006-0039 AND LIMITED IT TO NEWGATE ALONE NEWGATE INDEED BECAME THE SOLE THEME OF THEIR FIRST REPORT
LJ006-0040 THE FACT WAS THAT THE YEARS AS THEY PASSED NEARLY TWENTY IN ALL HAD WORKED BUT LITTLE PERMANENT IMPROVEMENT IN THIS DETESTABLE PRISON
LJ006-0041 CHANGES INTRODUCED UNDER PRESSURE HAD BEEN ONLY SKIN DEEP
LJ006-0042 RELAPSE WAS RAPID AND INEVITABLE SO THAT THE LATTER STATE OF THE PRISON WAS WORSE THAN THE FIRST
LJ006-0043 THE DISGRACEFUL OVERCROWDING HAD BEEN PARTIALLY ENDED BUT THE SAME EVILS OF INDISCRIMINATE ASSOCIATION WERE STILL PRESENT THERE WAS THE OLD NEGLECT OF DECENCY
LJ006-0044 THE SAME CALLOUS INDIFFERENCE TO THE MORAL WELLBEING OF THE PRISONERS THE SAME WANT OF EMPLOYMENT AND OF ALL DISCIPLINARY CONTROL
LJ006-0045 ALL THESE EVILS WERE SET FORTH AT LENGTH IN THE INSPECTORS' FIRST REPORT
LJ006-0046 THERE WAS NO LONGER THE FAINTEST POSSIBLE EXCUSE FOR OVERCROWDING. THE NUMBERS NOW COMMITTED TO NEWGATE HAD SENSIBLY DIMINISHED
LJ006-0047 THE PRISON HAD BECOME MORE OR LESS A PLACE OF DETENTION ONLY HARBORING MAINLY THOSE AWAITING TRIAL
LJ006-0048 TO THESE WERE STILL ADDED AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT FIFTY EXPECTING THE LAST PENALTY OF THE LAW A CERTAIN NUMBER OF TRANSPORTS AWAITING REMOVAL TO THE COLONIES
LJ006-0049 AN OCCASIONAL PRISONER OR TWO COMMITTED BY THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT THE COURTS OF KING'S BENCH COMMON PLEAS
LJ006-0050 THE EXCHEQUER THE COMMISSIONERS OF BANKRUPTCY AND OF TAXES SMUGGLERS AND A LARGER NUMBER SENTENCED FOR VERY SHORT TERMS
LJ006-0051 AND FOR OFFENSES OF THE MOST VARYING DESCRIPTION BY THE CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT
LJ006-0052 THE SUM TOTAL THUS PRODUCED WAS INCONSIDERABLE COMPARED WITH THE HUNDREDS THAT HAD FORMERLY FILLED THE JAIL
LJ006-0053 AND THE WHOLE BY PROPER MANAGEMENT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SO ACCOMMODATED AS TO PREVENT OVERCROWDING
LJ006-0054 BUT INCREDIBLE AS IT MAY APPEAR THE AUTHORITIES OF NEWGATE DECLINED TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THE ADVANTAGES OFFERED THEM
LJ006-0055 AND WHEN THE POPULATION FELL THEY SHUT UP ONE HALF THE JAIL AND CROWDED UP THE OTHER
LJ006-0056 SOME ROOMS REMAINED QUITE EMPTY AND UNOCCUPIED WHILE OTHERS WERE FULL TO OVERFLOWING
LJ006-0057 NOT ONLY WERE THE WARDS THUS NEEDLESSLY CRAMMED AND FOR NO REASON BUT THE NIGGARDLINESS OF THE CORPORATION WHICH REFUSED A PROPER SUPPLY OF BEDDING
LJ006-0058 BUT THE OCCUPANTS OF EACH WERE HUDDLED TOGETHER INDISCRIMINATELY. THE INSPECTORS FOUND IN THE SAME WARDS IN THE CHAPEL YARD THE CONVICTED AND THE UNTRIED
LJ006-0059 THE FELON AND THE MISDEMEANANT THE SANE AND THE INSANE THE OLD AND YOUNG OFFENDER
LJ006-0060 THE CLASSIFICATION PRESCRIBED BY THE JAIL ACT WHICH LAID DOWN THAT CERTAIN PRISONERS SHOULD NOT INTERMIX WAS OPENLY NEGLECTED
LJ006-0061 AND THE GREATEST CONTEMPT SHOWN FOR THE LAW
LJ006-0062 IN ANOTHER PART THERE WERE MEN CHARGED WITH AND CONVICTED OF UNNATURAL OFFENSES SHUT UP WITH LADS OF TENDER YEARS
LJ006-0063 MINOR OFFENDERS CHARGED WITH SMALL THEFTS OR NONPAYMENT OF SMALL SUMS WERE CHEEK BY JOWL WITH CONVICTS SENTENCED TO LONG TERMS OF TRANSPORTATION
LJ006-0064 IN THE MASTER'S SIDE YARD WHICH HAD ONLY ONE WASHING PLACE AS MANY AS SEVENTYEIGHT PRISONERS FREQUENTLY MORE
LJ006-0065 WERE ASSOCIATED TOGETHER OF EVERY VARIETY OF AGE HABIT AND DELINQUENCY WITHOUT EMPLOYMENT OVERSIGHT OR CONTROL
LJ006-0066 IN THE MIDDLE YARD IT WAS STILL WORSE
LJ006-0067 HERE SAY THE INSPECTORS ARE HERDED TOGETHER THE VERY WORST CLASS OF PRISONERS CERTAINLY A MORE WRETCHED COMBINATION OF HUMAN BEINGS CAN HARDLY BE IMAGINED
LJ006-0068 WE HAVE REASON TO FEAR THAT POVERTY RAGGED CLOTHES AND AN INABILITY TO PAY THE WARD DUES ELSEWHERE EXACTED FOR BETTER ACCOMMODATION
LJ006-0069 CONSIGN MANY OF THE MORE PETTY AND UNPRACTICED OFFENDERS TO THIS PLACE
LJ006-0070 WHERE THEY INEVITABLY MEET WITH FURTHER CONTAMINATION FROM THE SOCIETY OF THE MOST ABANDONED AND INCORRIGIBLE INMATES OF THE JAIL
LJ006-0071 NO DOUBT THE GOVERNOR FOR THE TIME BEING MR. COPE WAS IN A GREAT MEASURE TO BLAME FOR ALL THIS AND FOR THE WANT OF PROPER CLASSIFICATION
LJ006-0072 I SHALL HAVE OCCASION TO SPEAK AGAIN AND MORE AT LENGTH OF MR. COPE'S CARELESS AND PERFUNCTORY DISCHARGE
LJ006-0073 OF HIS MANY MANIFEST DUTIES BUT I SHALL HERE CONFINE MYSELF TO ANIMADVERTING ON HIS NEGLECT AS REGARDS THE APPROPRIATION OF HIS PRISON
LJ006-0074 HE WAS UNABLE TO GIVE ANY REASON WHATEVER FOR NOT UTILIZING THE WHOLE OF THE WARDS
LJ006-0075 HE SAW CERTAIN ROOMS FILL UP AND YET TOOK NO STEPS TO OPEN OTHERS THAT WERE LOCKED UP AND EMPTY
LJ006-0076 HE BLAMED THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEWGATE FOR THE NEGLECT OF CLASSIFICATION AND WAS YET COMPELLED TO CONFESS THAT HE HAD MADE NO ATTEMPT WHATEVER TO CARRY IT OUT
LJ006-0077 THE FACT WAS HE DID NOT KEEP THE CLASSIFICATION OF PRISONERS ON FIRST ARRIVAL IN HIS OWN HANDS NOR EVEN IN THAT OF HIS OFFICERS
LJ006-0078 A NEW PRISONER'S FATE AS TO LOCATION RESTED REALLY WITH A POWERFUL FELLOWPRISONER
LJ006-0079 THE INSPECTORS FOUND THAT PRISONERS HAD THEIR PLACES ASSIGNED TO THEM
LJ006-0080 BY THE INNER GATESMAN HIMSELF A CONVICTED PRISONER AND A WARDSMAN OR RESPONSIBLE HEAD OF A ROOM
LJ006-0081 THE WARDSMAN STILL EXACTED DUES OF WHICH MORE DIRECTLY
LJ006-0082 AND THIS PARTICULAR OFFICIAL TOOK EXCELLENT CARE TO SELECT AS RESIDENTS FOR HIS OWN WARD THOSE MOST SUITABLE FROM HIS OWN POINT OF VIEW
LJ006-0083 SO GREAT IS THE AUTHORITY EXERCISED BY HIM
LJ006-0084 AND SO NUMEROUS WERE HIS OPPORTUNITIES OF SHOWING FAVORITISM THAT ALL THE PRISONERS MAY BE SAID TO BE IN HIS POWER
LJ006-0085 IF A MAN IS POOR AND RAGGED HOWEVER INEXPERIENCED IN CRIME OR HOWEVER TRIFLING MAY BE THE OFFENSE FOR WHICH HE HAS BEEN COMMITTED
LJ006-0086 HIS PLACE IS ASSIGNED AMONG THE MOST DEPRAVED THE MOST EXPERIENCED AND THE MOST INCORRIGIBLE OFFENDERS IN THE MIDDLE YARD
LJ006-0087 IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT SO FAR BUT LITTLE EFFORT HAD BEEN MADE TO COUNTERACT THE EVILS OF INDISCRIMINATE ASSOCIATION
LJ006-0088 IT WAS NOT LIKELY THAT A SYSTEM WHICH LEFT INNOCENT MEN  FOR THE GREAT BULK OF NEW ARRIVALS WERE STILL UNTRIED
LJ006-0089 TO BE PITCHFORKED BY CHANCE ANYWHERE INTO ANY SORT OF COMPANY
LJ006-0090 WITHIN THIS THE GREATEST NURSERY OF CRIME IN LONDON SHOULD EXERCISE EVEN THE COMMONEST CARE FOR THE PERSONAL DECENCY OR COMFORT OF THE PRISONERS
LJ006-0091 THEIR TREATMENT WAS ALSO A MATTER OF CHANCE. THEY STILL SLEPT ON ROPE MATS ON THE FLOOR HERDED TOGETHER IN COMPANIES OF FOUR OR MORE TO KEEP ONE ANOTHER WARM
LJ006-0092 AND UNDER THE SCANTY COVERING OF A COUPLE OF DIRTY STABLERUGS APIECE
LJ006-0093 SO CLOSELY DID THEY LIE TOGETHER THAT THE INSPECTORS AT THEIR NIGHT VISITS FOUND IT DIFFICULT IN STEPPING ACROSS THE ROOM TO AVOID TREADING ON THEM
LJ006-0094 SOMETIMES TWO MATS WERE ALLOTTED TO THREE SLEEPERS. SOMETIMES FOUR SLEPT UNDER THE SAME BEDDING AND LEFT THEIR MATS UNOCCUPIED
LJ006-0095 THE RUGS USED WERE NEVER WASHED AN ORDER EXISTED THAT THE BEDDING SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO THE YARDS TO BE AIRED BUT IT WAS NOT VERY PUNCTUALLY OBEYED
LJ006-0096 THE ONLY CONVENIENCE FOR PERSONAL ABLUTIONS WERE THE PUMPS IN THE YARDS AND THE FAROFF BATHS IN THE CONDEMNED OR PRESSYARD
LJ006-0097 WATER MIGHT NOT BE TAKEN INTO THE WARD FOR WASHING PURPOSES
LJ006-0098 THERE WAS SOME PROVISION OF CLOTHING BUT IT WAS QUITE INSUFFICIENT AND NOTHING AT ALL WAS GIVEN IF PRISONERS HAD ENOUGH OF THEIR OWN TO COVER THEIR NAKEDNESS
LJ006-0099 THE INSPECTORS PARADED THE PRISONERS AND FOUND THEM GENERALLY RAGGED AND ILLCLAD SQUALID AND FILTHY IN THE EXTREME
LJ006-0100 MANY WITHOUT STOCKINGS AND WITH HARDLY SHOES TO THEIR FEET
LJ006-0101 SOME WHO HAD THE SEMBLANCE OF COVERING ON THE UPPER PART OF THEIR FEET HAD NO SOLES TO THE SHOES AND THEIR BARE FEET WERE ON THE GROUND
LJ006-0102 THIS TOO WAS IN THE DEPTH OF THE WINTER AND DURING A MOST INCLEMENT SEASON
LJ006-0103 THE ALLOWANCE OF FOOD WAS NOT ILLIBERAL
LJ006-0104 BUT ITS ISSUE WAS PRECARIOUS AND DEPENDENT ON THE GOOD WILL OF THE WARDSMEN WHO MEASURED OUT THE PORTIONS TO EACH ACCORDING TO HIS EYE
LJ006-0105 AND NOT WITH WEIGHTS AND MEASURES NO TURNKEY BEING PRESENT
LJ006-0106 TOO MUCH WAS LEFT TO THE WARDSMAN. IT WAS HE WHO COULD ISSUE SMALL LUXURIES
LJ006-0107 HE SOLD TEA COFFEE SUGAR TOBACCO ALTHOUGH PROHIBITED AND EXTRA BEER
LJ006-0108 HE CHARGED A WEEKLY SUM AS WARD DUES FOR THE USE OF KNIVES FORKS AND PLATES
LJ006-0109 A PERPETUATION UNDER ANOTHER FORM OF THE OLD DETESTABLE CUSTOM OF GARNISH
LJ006-0110 HE HAD POWER WHERE HIS EXACTIONS WERE RESISTED OF MAKING THE WARD MOST UNCOMFORTABLE FOR THE DEFAULTER
LJ006-0111 HE COULD TRUMP UP A FALSE COMPLAINT AGAINST HIS FELLOWPRISONER AND SO GET HIM PUNISHED
LJ006-0112 HE MIGHT KEEP HIM FROM THE FIRE OR GIVE HIM HIS SOUP OR GRUEL IN A PAIL INSTEAD OF A BASIN
LJ006-0113 THE AUTHORITY OF THESE WARDSMEN SO IMPROPERLY EXALTED AND SO ENTIRELY UNCHECKED DEGENERATED INTO A BANEFUL DESPOTISM
LJ006-0114 THEY BOUGHT THEIR OFFICES FROM ONE ANOTHER AND WERE THUS CONSIDERED TO HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN THEM
LJ006-0115 THEIR ORIGINAL CAPITAL HAD BEEN A FEW SHILLINGS AND FOR THIS THEY PURCHASED THE RIGHT TO TAX THEIR FELLOWS TO THE EXTENT OF POUNDS PER WEEK
LJ006-0116 THE WARDSMAN HAD A MONOPOLY IN SUPPLYING PROVISIONS GAVE DINNER AND BREAKFAST AT HIS OWN PRICE AND WAS SUCH COMPLETE MASTER OF THE WARD
LJ006-0117 THAT NONE OF ITS INMATES WERE SUFFERED TO MAKE TEA OR COFFEE FOR THEMSELVES LEST IT SHOULD INTERFERE WITH HIS SALES
LJ006-0118 HE MADE COLLECTIONS WHEN IT SUITED HIM FOR WARD PURPOSES TO BE SPENT AS HE CHOSE IN CANDLES AND SO FORTH
LJ006-0119 WHEN THE WARDSMAN WAS A MAN OF SOME EDUCATION WITH SOME KNOWLEDGE OF LEGAL CHICANERY GAINED BY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE HE MIGHT ADD CONSIDERABLY TO HIS EMOLUMENTS
LJ006-0120 BY DRAWING BRIEFS AND PETITIONS FOR HIS FELLOWS. THERE WAS A RECOGNIZED CHARGE OF 5 SHILLINGS PER BRIEF
LJ006-0121 FOR A PETITION OF FROM ONE SHILLING HALF PENCE TO EIGHT SHILLINGS ACCORDING TO ITS LENGTH
LJ006-0122 AND BY THESE PAYMENTS A WARDSMAN HAD BEEN KNOWN TO AMASS AS MUCH AS £40
LJ006-0123 THE MAN INTRUSTED WITH THIS PRIVILEGE WAS OFTEN THE INNER GATESMAN
LJ006-0124 THE PRISONER OFFICIAL ALREADY MENTIONED WHO HELD THE FATE OF NEW ARRIVALS AS REGARDS LOCATION IN HIS HANDS
LJ006-0125 IT WAS NOT STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD SOMETIMES MISUSE HIS POWER AND WHEN PRISONERS WERE NOT TO BE CAJOLED INTO SECURING HIS LEGAL SERVICES
LJ006-0126 HAD BEEN KNOWN TO EMPLOY THREATS DECLARING THAT HE WAS OFTEN CONSULTED BY THE GOVERNOR AS TO A PRISONER'S CHARACTER
LJ006-0127 IN VIEW OF SPEAKING TO IT AT THE TRIAL AND HE COULD EASILY DO THEM A GOOD TURN  OR A VERY BAD ONE
LJ006-0128 THE BRIEFDRAWING GATESMAN AND WARDSMAN AT THE TIME OF THE INSPECTORS' FIRST VISIT MUST HAVE BEEN A PARTICULARLY POWERFUL PERSONAGE
LJ006-0129 HE WAS ON THE MOST INTIMATE AND IMPROPERLY FAMILIAR TERMS WITH THE TURNKEYS
LJ006-0130 HAD A KEY OF BOTH THE MASTER'S SIDE AND MIDDLE SIDE YARDS WAS THE ONLY PERSON PRESENT AT THE DISTRIBUTION OF BEER AND WAS TRUSTED TO EXAMINE
LJ006-0131 AND IF HE CHOSE PASS IN ALL PROVISIONS MONEY CLOTHES AND LETTERS BROUGHT FOR PRISONERS BY THEIR FRIENDS
LJ006-0132 ALL THE WARDSMEN ALIKE WERE MORE OR LESS IRRESPONSIBLE
LJ006-0133 THE TURNKEYS COMPLAINED BITTERLY THAT THESE OLD PRISONERS HAD MORE POWER THAN THEY THEMSELVES
LJ006-0134 THE GOVERNOR HIMSELF ADMITTED THAT A PRISONER OF WEAK INTELLECT WHO HAD BEEN SEVERELY BEATEN AND MUCH INJURED BY A WARDSMAN DID NOT DARE COMPLAIN
LJ006-0135 THE VICTIM OF THIS CRUEL ILLUSAGE HAVING MORE FEAR OF THE POWER OF THE WARDSMAN TO INJURE HIM THAN CONFIDENCE IN THE GOVERNOR'S POWER TO PROTECT HIM
LJ006-0136 THESE WARDSMEN BESIDES THUS RULING THE ROAST HAD NUMEROUS SPECIAL PRIVILEGES IF SUCH THEY CAN BE CALLED
LJ006-0137 THEY WERE NOT OBLIGED TO ATTEND CHAPEL AND SELDOM IF EVER WENT PRISONERS SAID ONE OF THEM UNDER EXAMINATION DID NOT LIKE THE TROUBLE OF GOING TO CHAPEL
LJ006-0138 THEY HAD A STANDING BEDSTEAD TO SLEEP ON AND A GOOD FLOCK MATTRESS DOUBLE ALLOWANCE OF PROVISIONS FILCHED FROM THE COMMON STOCK
LJ006-0139 NOBODY INTERFERED WITH THEM OR REGULATED THEIR CONDUCT. THEY MIGHT GET DRUNK WHEN SO DISPOSED AND DID SO FREQUENTLY ALONE OR IN COMPANY
LJ006-0140 EVIDENCE WAS GIVEN BEFORE THE INSPECTORS OF EIGHT OR TEN PRISONERS SEEN GIDDY DRUNK NOT ABLE TO SIT UPON FORMS
LJ006-0141 THE FEMALE WARDSWOMEN WERE ALSO GIVEN TO INTEMPERANCE
LJ006-0142 THE MATRON DEPOSED TO HAVING SEEN THE GATESWOMAN EXCEEDINGLY DRUNK AND HAVING BEEN INSULTED BY HER
LJ006-0143 THERE WAS NO PENALTY ATTACHED TO DRUNKENNESS
LJ006-0144 A WARDSMAN DID NOT NECESSARILY LOSE HIS SITUATION FOR IT. NOR WAS DRINK THE ONLY CREATURE COMFORT HE MIGHT ENJOY
LJ006-0145 HE COULD INDULGE IN SNUFF IF A SNUFFTAKER
LJ006-0146 AND MIGHT ALWAYS SMOKE HIS PIPE UNDISTURBED FOR ALTHOUGH THE USE OF TOBACCO HAD BEEN PROHIBITED SINCE THE REPORT OF THE LORDS COMMITTEE
LJ006-0147 IT WAS STILL FREELY INTRODUCED INTO THE PRISON
LJ006-0148 PROBABLY AUTHORITY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO RECKLESSLY USURPED BY THE WARDSMEN HAD NOT THE PROPER OFFICIALS TOO READILY SURRENDERED IT
LJ006-0149 THE TURNKEYS LEFT THE PRISONERS VERY MUCH TO THEMSELVES NEVER ENTERING THE WARDS AFTER LOCKINGUP TIME AT DUSK TILL UNLOCKING NEXT MORNING
LJ006-0150 AND THEN ONLY WENT ROUND TO COUNT THE NUMBER
LJ006-0151 MANY OF THEM WERE OTHERWISE AND IMPROPERLY OCCUPIED FOR HOURS EVERY DAY IN MENIAL SERVICES FOR THE GOVERNOR CLEANING HIS WINDOWS OR GROOMING HIS HORSE
LJ006-0152 ONE TURNKEY HAD BEEN SO EMPLOYED SEVERAL HOURS DAILY FOR NEARLY ELEVEN YEARS
LJ006-0153 IT WAS NOT STRANGE THAT SUBORDINATES SHOULD NEGLECT THEIR DUTY WHEN SUPERIORS SET THE EXAMPLE
LJ006-0154 NOTHING WAS MORE PROMINENTLY BROUGHT OUT BY THE INSPECTORS THAN THE INEFFICIENCY OF THE GOVERNOR AT THAT TIME MR. COPE
LJ006-0155 HE MAY HAVE ERRED IN SOME POINTS THROUGH IGNORANCE BUT IN OTHERS HE WAS CLEARLY GUILTY OF CULPABLE NEGLECT
LJ006-0156 WE HAVE SEEN THAT HE TOOK NO PAINS TO CLASSIFY AND SEPARATE PRISONERS ON RECEPTION
LJ006-0157 THIS WAS ONLY ONE OF MANY GRAVE OMISSIONS ON HIS PART. HE DID NOT FEEL IT INCUMBENT ON HIMSELF TO VISIT HIS PRISON OFTEN OR SEE HIS PRISONERS
LJ006-0158 THE ACT PRESCRIBED THAT HE SHOULD DO BOTH EVERY TWENTYFOUR HOURS BUT DAYS PASSED WITHOUT HIS ENTERING THE WARDS
LJ006-0159 THE PRISONERS DECLARED THAT THEY DID NOT SEE HIM OFTENER THAN TWICE A WEEK
LJ006-0160 ONE MAN WHO HAD BEEN IN THE CONDEMNED WARD FOR TWO MONTHS SAID THE GOVERNOR ONLY CAME THERE FOUR TIMES
LJ006-0161 AGAIN A TURNKEY DEPOSED THAT HIS CHIEF DID NOT ENTER THE WARDS MORE THAN ONCE A FORTNIGHT
LJ006-0162 BUT IT IS ONLY FAIR TO MR. COPE TO STATE THAT HE HIMSELF SAID HE WENT WHENEVER HE COULD FIND TIME
LJ006-0163 AND THAT HE WAS CONSTANTLY ENGAGED ATTENDING SESSIONS AND GOING WITH DRAFTS TO THE HULKS
LJ006-0164 BUT WHEN HE DID VISIT HIS INSPECTIONS WERE OF THE MOST SUPERFICIAL CHARACTER
LJ006-0165 SOMETIMES HE LOOKED AT HIS BOLTS AND BARS BUT HE NEVER EXAMINED THE CUPBOARDS COALBOXES OR OTHER POSSIBLE HIDINGPLACES FOR CARDS
LJ006-0166 DICE DANGEROUS IMPLEMENTS OR OTHER PROHIBITED ARTICLES
LJ006-0167 HE ONLY ATTENDED CHAPEL ONCE ON SUNDAY NEVER ON THE WEEKDAY AND GENERALLY DEVOTED THE TIME SERVICE WAS IN PROGRESS
LJ006-0168 TO TAKING THE DESCRIPTIONS OF NEWLYARRIVED PRISONERS
LJ006-0169 HE REALLY DID NOT KNOW WHAT PASSED IN HIS JAIL
LJ006-0170 AND WAS SURPRISED WHEN THE INSPECTORS PROVED TO HIM THAT PRACTICES OF WHICH HE WAS IGNORANT AND WHICH HE ADMITTED THAT HE REPREHENDED WENT ON WITHOUT HINDRANCE
LJ006-0171 HE WAS SATISFIED TO LET MATTERS RUN ON AS IN THE OLD TIMES HE SAID IN HIS OWN JUSTIFICATION WITH HIM WHAT WAS WAS RIGHT
LJ006-0172 AND EVILS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SPEEDILY ROOTED OUT REMAINED BECAUSE THEY HAD THE PRESCRIPTION OF LONG USAGE
LJ006-0173 HE KEPT NO DAILY JOURNAL OF OCCURRENCES AND NOTHING HOWEVER IMPORTANT WAS RECORDED AT THE TIME
LJ006-0174 THE ALDERMEN NEVER CALLED UPON HIM TO REPORT AND LEFT HIM NEARLY UNSUPERVISED AND UNCONTROLLED
LJ006-0175 IN HIS ADMINISTRATION OF DISCIPLINE HE WAS QUITE UNCERTAIN
LJ006-0176 THE PUNISHMENTS HE INFLICTED WERE UNEQUAL
LJ006-0177 AND IT WAS NOT THE LEAST PART OF THE BLAME IMPUTED TO HIM THAT HE MADE SPECIAL FAVORITES OF PARTICULAR PRISONERS RETAINING OF HIS OWN ACCORD IN NEWGATE
LJ006-0178 AND FOR YEARS FELONS WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN SENT BEYOND THE SEAS
LJ006-0179 BUT INDEED HIS WHOLE RULE WAS FAR TOO MILD AND UNDER THIS MISTAKEN LENIENCY
LJ006-0180 THE INTERIOR OF THE JAIL WAS MORE LIKE A BEARGARDEN OR THE NOISY PURLIEUS OF A PUBLICHOUSE THAN A PRISON
LJ006-0181 IT WAS THE SAME OLD STORY  EVIL CONSTANTLY IN THE ASCENDANT THE LEAST CRIMINAL AT THE MERCY OF THE MOST DEPRAVED
LJ006-0182 UNDER THE RECKLESS CONTEMPT FOR REGULATIONS
LJ006-0183 THE APATHY OF THE AUTHORITIES AND THE UNDUE ASCENDANCY OF THOSE WHO AS CONVICTED FELONS SHOULD HAVE BEEN MOST STERNLY REPRESSED
LJ006-0184 THE MOST HARDENED AND THE OLDEST IN VICE HAD THE BEST OF IT WHILE THE INEXPERIENCED BEGINNER WENT TO THE WALL
LJ006-0185 EDWARD GIBBON WAKEFIELD WHO SPENT THREE YEARS IN NEWGATE A LITTLE BEFORE THE TIME OF THE INSPECTORS' FIRST REPORT
LJ006-0186 SAID WITH JUSTICE THAT INCREDIBLE SCENES OF HORROR OCCUR IN NEWGATE
LJ006-0187 IT WAS MOREOVER IN HIS OPINION UNDOUBTEDLY THE GREATEST NURSERY OF CRIME IN LONDON
LJ006-0188 THE DAYS WERE PASSED IN IDLENESS DEBAUCHERY RIOTOUS QUARRELING IMMORAL CONVERSATION
LJ006-0189 GAMBLING INDIRECT CONTRAVENTION OF PARLIAMENTARY RULES INSTRUCTION IN ALL NEFARIOUS PROCESSES
LJ006-0190 LIVELY DISCOURSE UPON PAST CRIMINAL EXPLOITS ELABORATE DISCUSSION OF OTHERS TO BE PERPETRATED AFTER RELEASE
LJ006-0191 NO PROVISION WHATEVER WAS MADE FOR THE EMPLOYMENT OF PRISONERS NO MATERIALS WERE PURCHASED NO TRADE INSTRUCTORS APPOINTED
LJ006-0192 THERE WAS NO SCHOOL FOR ADULTS ONLY THE BOYS WERE TAUGHT ANYTHING AND THEIR INSTRUCTOR WITH HIS ASSISTANT WERE CONVICTED PRISONERS
LJ006-0193 IDLE HANDS AND UNOCCUPIED BRAINS FOUND IN MISCHIEF THE ONLY MEANS OF WHILING AWAY THE LONG HOURS OF INCARCERATION
LJ006-0194 GAMING OF ALL KINDS ALTHOUGH FORBIDDEN BY THE JAIL ACTS WAS HABITUALLY PRACTICED
LJ006-0195 THIS WAS ADMITTED IN EVIDENCE BY THE TURNKEYS AND WAS PROVED BY THE APPEARANCE OF THE PRISON TABLES WHICH BORE THE MARKS OF GAMINGBOARDS DEEPLY CUT INTO THEM
LJ006-0196 PRISONERS CONFESSED THAT IT WAS A FAVORITE OCCUPATION THE CHIEF GAMES BEING SHOVING HALFPENCE ON THE TABLE
LJ006-0197 PITCH IN THE HOLE CRIBBAGE DOMINOES AND COMMON TOSSING AT WHICH AS MUCH AS FOUR OR FIVE SHILLINGS WOULD CHANGE HANDS IN AN HOUR
LJ006-0198 BUT THIS WAS NOT THE ONLY AMUSEMENT. MOST OF THE WARDS TOOK IN THE DAILY PAPERS
LJ006-0199 THE MOST POPULAR BEING THE TIMES MORNING HERALD AND MORNING CHRONICLE ON SUNDAY THE WEEKLY DISPATCH BELL'S LIFE AND THE WEEKLY MESSENGER
LJ006-0200 THE NEWSMAN HAD FREE ACCESS TO THE PRISON HE PASSED IN UNSEARCHED AND UNEXAMINED AND UNACCOMPANIED BY AN OFFICER
LJ006-0201 WENT AT ONCE TO HIS CUSTOMERS WHO BOUGHT THEIR PAPER AND PAID FOR IT THEMSELVES
LJ006-0202 THE NEWSVENDOR WAS ALSO A TOBACCONIST
LJ006-0203 AND HE HAD THUS AMPLE MEANS OF INTRODUCING TO THE PRISONERS THE PROHIBITED BUT ALWAYS MUCHCOVETED AND GENERALLY PROCURABLE WEED
LJ006-0204 IN THE SAME WAY THE WARDSMAN LAID IN HIS STOCK TO BE RETAILED. OTHER LIGHT LITERATURE BESIDES THE DAILY JOURNALS WERE IN CIRCULATION
LJ006-0205 NOVELS FLASH SONGS PLAYBOOKS SUCH AS JANE SHORE GRIMM'S GERMAN TALES WITH CRUIKSHANK'S ILLUSTRATIONS
LJ006-0206 AND PUBLICATIONS WHICH IN THESE DAYS WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE THE SUBJECT OF A CRIMINAL PROSECUTION
LJ006-0207 ONE OF THESE PUBLISHED BY STOCKDALE THE INSPECTORS STYLED A BOOK OF THE MOST DISGUSTING NATURE
LJ006-0208 THERE WAS ALSO A GOOD SUPPLY OF BIBLES AND PRAYERS
LJ006-0209 THE DONATION OF A PHILANTHROPIC GENTLEMAN CAPTAIN BROWN BUT THESE PARTICULARLY THE BIBLES BORE LITTLE APPEARANCE OF HAVING BEEN USED
LJ006-0210 DRINK IN MORE OR LESS UNLIMITED QUANTITIES WAS STILL TO BE HAD
LJ006-0211 SPIRITS CERTAINLY WERE NOW EXCLUDED BUT A POTMAN WITH FULL PERMISSION OF THE SHERIFFS
LJ006-0212 BROUGHT IN BEER FOR SALE FROM A NEIGHBORING PUBLICHOUSE AND VISITED ALL THE WARDS WITH NO OTHER ESCORT THAN THE PRISONER GATESMAN
LJ006-0213 THE QUANTITY TO BE ISSUED PER HEAD WAS LIMITED BY THE PRISON REGULATIONS TO ONE PINT
LJ006-0214 BUT NO STEPS WERE TAKEN TO PREVENT ANY PRISONER FROM OBTAINING MORE IF HE COULD PAY FOR IT
LJ006-0215 THE BEERMAN BROUGHT IN AS MUCH AS HE PLEASED HE SOLD IT WITHOUT THE CONTROLLING PRESENCE OF AN OFFICER
LJ006-0216 NOT ONLY DID PRISONERS COME AGAIN AND AGAIN FOR A PINT BUT LARGE QUANTITIES WERE CARRIED OFF TO THE WARDS TO BE DRUNK LATER IN THE DAY
LJ006-0217 THERE WERE MORE VARIED AND AT TIMES ESPECIALLY WHEN BEER HAD CIRCULATED FREELY MORE UPROARIOUS DIVERSIONS
LJ006-0218 WRESTLING IN WHICH LEGS WERE OCCASIONALLY BROKEN WAS FREELY INDULGED IN ALSO SUCH LOW GAMES AS COBHAM
LJ006-0219 LEAPFROG PUSS IN THE CORNER AND FLY THE GARTER FOR WHICH PURPOSE THE RUGS WERE SPREAD OUT TO PREVENT FEET SLIPPING ON THE FLOOR
LJ006-0220 FEASTING ALTERNATED WITH FIGHTING
LJ006-0221 THE WEEKLY INTRODUCTION OF FOOD TO WHICH I SHALL PRESENTLY REFER FORMED THE BASIS OF LUXURIOUS BANQUETS WASHED DOWN BY LIQUOR
LJ006-0222 AND ENLIVENED BY FLASH SONGS AND THRILLING LONGWINDED DESCRIPTIONS OF ROBBERIES AND OTHER PLANTS
LJ006-0223 THERE WAS MUCH SWEARING AND BAD LANGUAGE THE VERY WORST THAT COULD BE USED FROM THE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING TO THE LAST THING AT NIGHT
LJ006-0224 NEW ARRIVALS ESPECIALLY THE INNOCENT AND STILL GUILELESS DEBUTANT WERE TORMENTED WITH RUDE HORSEPLAY AND ASSAILED BY THE MOST INSULTING CHAFF
LJ006-0225 IF ANY MAN PRESUMED TO TURN IN TOO EARLY
LJ006-0226 HE WAS TOED THAT IS TO SAY A STRING WAS FASTENED TO HIS BIG TOE WHILE HE WAS ASLEEP AND HE WAS DRAGGED FROM OFF HIS MAT
LJ006-0227 OR HIS BEDCLOTHES WERE DRAWN AWAY ACROSS THE ROOM
LJ006-0228 THE RAGGED PART OF THE PRISONERS WERE VERY ANXIOUS TO DESTROY THE CLOTHES OF THE BETTER DRESSED AND OFTEN LIGHTED SMALL PIECES OF CLOTH
LJ006-0229 WHICH THEY DROPPED SMOLDERING INTO THEIR FELLOWPRISONERS' POCKETS
LJ006-0230 OFTEN THE VICTIM GOADED TO MADNESS ATTACKED HIS TORMENTORS A FIGHT WAS THEN CERTAIN TO FOLLOW
LJ006-0231 THESE FIGHTS SOMETIMES TOOK PLACE IN THE DAYTIME WHEN A RING WAS REGULARLY FORMED AND TWO OR THREE STOOD BY THE DOOR TO WATCH FOR THE OFFICER'S APPROACH
LJ006-0232 MORE OFTEN THEY OCCURRED AT NIGHT AND WERE CONTINUED TO THE BITTER END
LJ006-0233 THE PRISONERS IN THIS WAY ADMINISTERED SERIOUS PUNISHMENT ON ONE ANOTHER. BLACK EYES AND BROKEN NOSES WERE ALWAYS TO BE SEEN
LJ006-0234 MORE CRUEL INJURIES WERE COMMON ENOUGH WHICH DID NOT RESULT FROM HONEST HANDTOHAND FIGHTS
LJ006-0235 THE SURGEON'S JOURNAL PRODUCED TO THE INSPECTORS CONTAINED NUMEROUS ENTRIES OF TERRIBLE WOUNDS INFLICTED IN A COWARDLY WAY
LJ006-0236 A SERIOUS ACCIDENT ONE OF THE PRISONERS HAD A HOT POKER RUN INTO HIS EYE
LJ006-0237 A LAD NAMED MATTHEW WHITE HAS HAD A WOUND IN HIS EYE BY A BONE THROWN AT HIM WHICH VERY NEARLY DESTROYED VISION
LJ006-0238 THERE WAS A DISTURBANCE IN THE TRANSPORT YARD YESTERDAY EVENING AND THE POLICE WERE CALLED IN
LJ006-0239 DURING THE TUMULT A PRISONER WHO WAS ONE OF THE WORST OF THE RIOTERS WAS BRUISED ABOUT THE HEAD AND BODY
LJ006-0240 WATKINS' KNEEJOINT IS VERY SEVERELY INJURED
LJ006-0241 A PRISONER BAXTER IS IN THE INFIRMARY IN CONSEQUENCE OF A SEVERE INJURY TO HIS WRISTJOINT
LJ006-0242 WATKINS' CASE REFERRED TO ABOVE IS MADE THE SUBJECT OF ANOTHER AND A SPECIAL REPORT FROM THE SURGEON
LJ006-0243 HE WAS IN THE TRANSPORT SIDE WHEN ONE OF HIS FELLOWS IN ENDEAVORING TO STRIKE ANOTHER PRISONER WITH A LARGE POKER MISSED HIS AIM AND STRUCK WATKINS' KNEE
LJ006-0244 VIOLENT INFLAMMATION AND EXTENSIVE SUPPURATION ENSUED AND FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME AMPUTATION SEEMED INEVITABLE
LJ006-0245 AFTER SEVERE SUFFERING PROLONGED FOR MANY MONTHS THE INFLAMMATION WAS SUBDUED BUT THE CARTILAGE OF THE KNEEJOINT WAS DESTROYED AND HE WAS CRIPPLED FOR LIFE
LJ006-0246 ON ANOTHER OCCASION A YOUNG MAN WHO WAS BEING VIOLENTLY TEASED SEIZED A KNIFE AND STABBED HIS TORMENTOR IN THE BACK
LJ006-0247 THE PRISONER WHO USED THE KNIFE WAS SECURED BUT IT WAS THE WARDSMAN AND NOT THE OFFICERS TO WHOM THE REPORT WAS MADE AND NO OFFICIAL INQUIRY OR PUNISHMENT FOLLOWED
LJ006-0248 MATTERS WERE AT TIMES STILL WORSE AND THE RIOTING WENT ON TO SUCH DANGEROUS LENGTHS AS TO ENDANGER THE SAFETY OF THE BUILDING
LJ006-0249 ON ONE OCCASION A DISTURBANCE WAS RAISED WHICH WAS NOT QUELLED UNTIL WINDOWS HAD BEEN BROKEN AND FORMS AND TABLES BURNT
LJ006-0250 THE OFFICERS WERE OBLIGED TO GO IN AMONG THE PRISONERS TO RESTORE ORDER WITH DRAWN CUTLASSES
LJ006-0251 BUT THE PRESENCE AND AUTHORITY OF THE GOVERNOR HIMSELF BECAME INDISPENSABLE
LJ006-0252 THE WORST FIGHTS OCCURRED ON SUNDAY AFTERNOONS BUT NEARLY EVERY NIGHT THE ACT OF LOCKING UP BECAME FROM THE CONSEQUENT REMOVAL OF ALL SUPERVISION
LJ006-0253 THE SIGNAL FOR THE COMMENCEMENT OF OBSCENE TALK REVELRY AND VIOLENCE
LJ006-0254 OTHER REGULATIONS LAID DOWN BY THE JAIL ACTS WERE STILL DEFIED ONE OF THESE WAS THAT PRISONERS SHOULD BE RESTRICTED TO THE JAIL ALLOWANCE OF FOOD
LJ006-0255 BUT ALL COULD STILL OBTAIN AS MUCH EXTRA AND OF A LUXURIOUS KIND AS THEIR FRIENDS CHOSE TO BRING THEM IN
LJ006-0256 VISITORS WERE STILL PERMITTED TO COME WITH SUPPLIES ON GIVEN DAYS OF THE WEEK ABOUT THE ONLY LIMITATION BEING THAT THE FOOD SHOULD BE COOKED AND COLD
LJ006-0257 HOT MEAT POULTRY AND FISH WERE ALSO FORBIDDEN
LJ006-0258 BUT THE INSPECTORS FOUND IN THE WARD CUPBOARDS MINCEPIES AND OTHER PASTIES COLD JOINTS HAMS AND SO FORTH
LJ006-0259 MANY OTHER ARTICLES WERE INTRODUCED BY VISITORS INCLUDING MONEY TOBACCO PIPES AND SNUFF
LJ006-0260 FROM THE SAME SOURCE CAME THE TWO OR THREE STRONG FILES WHICH THE INSPECTORS FOUND IN ONE WARD
LJ006-0261 TOGETHER WITH FOUR BRADAWLS SEVERAL LARGE IRON SPIKES SCREWS NAILS AND KNIVES
LJ006-0262 ALL OF THEM INSTRUMENTS CALCULATED TO FACILITATE ATTEMPTS AT BREAKING OUT OF PRISON
LJ006-0263 AND CAPABLE OF BECOMING MOST DANGEROUS WEAPONS IN THE HANDS OF DESPERATE AND DETERMINED MEN
LJ006-0264 THE NEARLY INDISCRIMINATE ADMISSION OF VISITORS ALTHOUGH RESTRICTED TO CERTAIN DAYS CONTINUED TO BE AN UNMIXED EVIL
LJ006-0265 THE UNTRIED MIGHT SEE THEIR FRIENDS THREE TIMES A WEEK THE CONVICTED ONLY ONCE
LJ006-0266 ON THESE OCCASIONS PRECAUTIONS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE TAKEN TO EXCLUDE BAD CHARACTERS
LJ006-0267 YET MANY PERSONS OF NOTORIOUSLY LOOSE LIFE CONTINUALLY OBTAINED EGRESS
LJ006-0268 WOMEN SAW MEN IF THEY MERELY PRETENDED TO BE WIVES EVEN BOYS WERE VISITED BY THEIR SWEETHEARTS
LJ006-0269 DECENCY WAS HOWEVER INSURED BY A LINE OF DEMARCATION AND VISITORS WERE KEPT UPON EACH SIDE OF A SEPARATED DOUBLE IRON RAILING
LJ006-0270 BUT NO SEARCH WAS MADE TO INTERCEPT PROHIBITED ARTICLES AT THE GATE AND THERE WAS NO PERMANENT GATEKEEPER
LJ006-0271 WHICH WOULD HAVE GREATLY HELPED TO KEEP OUT BAD CHARACTERS. SOME IDEA OF THE DIFFICULTY AND INCONVENIENCE OF THESE LAX REGULATIONS AS REGARDS VISITING
LJ006-0272 MAY BE GATHERED FROM THE STATEMENT THAT AS MANY AS THREE HUNDRED WERE OFTEN ADMITTED ON THE SAME DAY
LJ006-0273 ENOUGH TO ALTOGETHER UPSET WHAT SMALL SHOW OF DECORUM AND DISCIPLINE WAS STILL PRESERVED IN THE PRISON
LJ006-0274 PERHAPS THE WORST FEATURE OF THE VISITING SYSTEM WAS THE PERMISSION ACCORDED TO MALE PRISONERS UNDER THE NAME OF HUSBANDS BROTHERS AND SONS
LJ006-0275 TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE FEMALE SIDE ON SUNDAYS AND WEDNESDAYS IN ORDER TO VISIT THEIR SUPPOSED RELATIONS THERE
LJ006-0276 ON THIS FEMALE SIDE WHERE THE LADIES' ASSOCIATION STILL REIGNED SUPREME MORE SYSTEM AND A GREATER SEMBLANCE OF DECORUM WAS MAINTAINED
LJ006-0277 BUT THERE WERE EVILS AKIN TO THOSE ON THE MALE SIDE PROMINENT AMONGST WHICH WAS THE UNDUE INFLUENCE ACCORDED TO PRISONERS
LJ006-0278 A FEMALE PRISONER KEPT THE REGISTERS
LJ006-0279 WARDSWOMEN WERE ALLOWED MUCH THE SAME AUTHORITY WITH THE SAME TEMPTATIONS TO EXCESS AND INTOXICATION WAS NOT UNKNOWN AMONG THEM AND OTHERS
LJ006-0280 THE CLOTHING WAS STILL MEAGER AND RAGGED THE WASHING PLACES INSUFFICIENT AND WANTING IN DECENCY
LJ006-0281 IN SOME YARDS
LJ006-0282 THE PUMP WAS THE ONLY PROVISION AND THIS IN A PLACE WITHIN SIGHT OF VISITORS OF THE WINDOWS OF THE MALE TURNKEYS AND UNPROTECTED FROM THE WEATHER
LJ006-0283 THERE WAS THE SAME CROWDING IN THE SLEEPING ARRANGEMENTS AS ON THE MALE SIDE THE SAME SCARCITY OF BEDDING
LJ006-0284 IT WAS A SPECIAL EVIL OF THIS PART OF THE PRISON THAT THE DEVOTIONAL EXERCISES ORIGINALLY SO PROFITABLE HAD GROWN INTO A KIND OF EDIFYING SPECTACLE
LJ006-0285 WHICH NUMBERS OF WELLMEANING BUT INQUISITIVE PEOPLE WERE ANXIOUS TO WITNESS
LJ006-0286 THUS WHEN THE INSPECTORS VISITED THERE WERE TWENTYTHREE STRANGERS AND ONLY TWENTYEIGHT PRISONERS
LJ006-0287 THE PRESENCE OF SO MANY STRANGERS MANY OF THEM GENTLEMEN DISTRACTED THE PRISONERS' ATTENTION AND COULD NOT BE PRODUCTIVE OF MUCH GOOD
LJ006-0288 THE SEPARATION OF THE SEXES WAS NOT INDEED RIGIDLY CARRIED OUT IN NEWGATE AS YET
LJ006-0289 WE HAVE SEEN THAT MALE PRISONERS VISITED THEIR FEMALE RELATIONS AND FRIENDS ON THE FEMALE SIDE. BESIDES THIS
LJ006-0290 THE GATESMAN WHO PREPARED THE BRIEFS HAD INTERVIEWS WITH FEMALE PRISONERS ALONE WHILE TAKING THEIR INSTRUCTIONS A FEMALE CAME ALONE AND UNACCOMPANIED BY A MATRON
LJ006-0291 TO CLEAN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN THE MALE PRISON
LJ006-0292 MALE PRISONERS CARRIED COAL INTO THE FEMALE PRISON WHEN THEY SAW AND COULD SPEAK OR PASS LETTERS TO THE FEMALE PRISONERS
LJ006-0293 AND THE MEN COULD ALSO AT ANY TIME GO FOR TEA COFFEE AND SUGAR TO MRS. BROWN'S SHOP WHICH WAS INSIDE THE FEMALE GATE
LJ006-0294 IN THE BAILDOCK WHERE MOST IMPROPER GENERAL ASSOCIATION WAS PERMITTED THE FEMALE PRISONERS WERE OFTEN ALTOGETHER IN THE CHARGE OF MALE TURNKEYS
LJ006-0295 THE GOVERNOR WAS ALSO PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR GROSS CONTRAVENTION OF THIS RULE OF SEPARATION
LJ006-0296 AND WAS IN THE HABIT OF DRAWING FREQUENTLY UPON THE FEMALE PRISON FOR PRISONERS TO ACT AS DOMESTIC SERVANTS IN HIS OWN PRIVATE DWELLING
LJ006-0297 SOME MEMBER OF THE LADIES' ASSOCIATION OBSERVED AND COMMENTED UPON THE FACT THAT A YOUNG ROSYCHEEKED GIRL HAD BEEN KEPT BY THE GOVERNOR FROM TRANSPORTATION
LJ006-0298 WHILE OLDER WOMEN IN INFIRM HEALTH WERE SENT ACROSS THE SEAS
LJ006-0299 HIS EXCUSE WAS THAT HE HAD GIVEN THE GIRL HIS PROMISE THAT SHE SHOULD NOT GO AN ASSUMPTION OF PREROGATIVE WHICH BY NO MEANS RESTED WITH HIM
LJ006-0300 BUT HE AFTERWARDS ADMITTED THAT THE GIRL HAD BEEN RECOMMENDED TO HIM BY THE PRINCIPAL TURNKEY WHO KNEW SOMETHING OF HER FRIENDS
LJ006-0301 THIS WOMAN WAS REALLY HIS SERVANT EMPLOYED TO HELP IN CLEANING AND TAKEN ON WHENEVER THERE WAS EXTRA WORK TO BE DONE
LJ006-0302 THE GOVERNOR HAD A GREAT DISLIKE HE SAID TO SEEING STRANGERS IN HIS HOUSE
LJ006-0303 THIS GIRL HAD BEEN FIRST ENGAGED ON ACCOUNT OF THE EXTRA WORK ENTAILED BY CERTAIN PRISONERS
LJ006-0304 COMMITTED BY THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WHO HAD BEEN LODGED IN THE GOVERNOR'S OWN HOUSE
LJ006-0305 THE HOUSE AT THIS TIME WAS FULL OF MEN AND VISITORS WAITERS CAME IN FROM THE TAVERNS WITH MEALS
LJ006-0306 SOME OF THE PRISONERS HAD THEIR VALETS AND ALL THESE WERE CONSTANTLY IN AND OUT OF THE KITCHEN WHERE THIS FEMALE PRISONER WAS EMPLOYED
LJ006-0307 THERE WAS REVELING AND ROISTERING AS USUAL WITH HIGH LIFE BELOWSTAIRS
LJ006-0308 THE GOVERNOR SENT DOWN WINE ON FESTIVE OCCASIONS OF WHICH NO DOUBT THE PRISONER HOUSEMAID HAD HER SHARE
LJ007-0001 THE CHRONICLES OF NEWGATE VOLUME TWO BY ARTHUR GRIFFITHS SECTION TEN THE FIRST REPORT OF THE INSPECTOR OF PRISONS
LJ007-0002 EIGHTEEN YEARS HAD ELAPSED SINCE THE FORMATION OF THE LADIES' ASSOCIATION
LJ007-0003 AND MRS. FRY WITH HER COLLEAGUES STILL LABORED ASSIDUOUSLY IN NEWGATE DEVOTING THEMSELVES MAINLY TO THE FEMALE PRISON
LJ007-0004 ALTHOUGH THEIR MINISTRATIONS WERE OCCASIONALLY EXTENDED TO THE MALE SIDE
LJ007-0005 THE INSPECTORS PAID TRIBUTE TO THE EXCELLENCE OF THE MOTIVES OF THESE PHILANTHROPIC LADIES AND RECOGNIZED THE GOOD THEY DID
LJ007-0006 THEY HAD INTRODUCED MUCH ORDER AND CLEANLINESS
LJ007-0007 HAD PROVIDED WORK FOR THOSE WHO HAD HITHERTO PASSED THEIR TIME IN TOTAL IDLENESS AND HAD MADE THE TREATMENT OF FEMALE TRANSPORTS ON THE WAY TO NEW SOUTH WALES
LJ007-0008 THEIR ESPECIAL CARE
LJ007-0009 THEY HAD TRIED MOREOVER
LJ007-0010 BY THEIR PRESENCE AND THEIR PIOUS DISINTERESTED EFFORTS TO RESTRAIN THE DISSOLUTE MANNERS AND VICIOUS LANGUAGE OF THE UNHAPPY AND DEPRAVED INMATES
LJ007-0011 BUT IT WAS ALREADY PLAIN THAT THEY CONSTITUTED AN INDEPENDENT AUTHORITY WITHIN THE JAILS THEY WERE FREQUENTLY IN CONFLICT WITH THE CHAPLAIN
LJ007-0012 WHO NOT STRANGELY RESENTED THE ORDERS ISSUED BY THE ALDERMEN
LJ007-0013 THAT WOMEN SHOULD BE FREQUENTLY KEPT FROM CHAPEL IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT ATTEND THE LADIES' LECTURES AND EXHORTATIONS
LJ007-0014 THE ADMISSION OF A CROWD OF VISITORS TO ASSIST IN THESE LAY SERVICES HAS ALREADY BEEN REMARKED UPON AS THE INSPECTORS POINTED OUT
LJ007-0015 IT HAD THE BAD EFFECT OF DISTRACTING ATTENTION
LJ007-0016 IT TENDED TO DISSIPATE REFLECTION DIMINISH THE GLOOM OF THE PRISON AND MITIGATE THE PUNISHMENT WHICH THE LAW HAS SENTENCED THE PRISONER TO UNDERGO
LJ007-0017 IT IS TO BE FEARED TOO THAT ALTHOUGH THE SURFACE WAS THUS WHITEWASHED AND DECOROUS MUCH THAT WAS VICIOUS STILL FESTERED AND RANKLED BENEATH
LJ007-0018 AND THAT WHEN THE RESTRAINING INFLUENCES OF THE LADIES WERE ABSENT THE FEMALE PRISONERS RELAPSED INTO IMMORAL AND UNCLEANLY DISCOURSE
LJ007-0019 EVEN IN THE DAYTIME WHEN SUPERVISION WAS WITHDRAWN THE LANGUAGE USED TO BE DREADFUL SAYS ONE OF THE WOMEN WHEN UNDER EXAMINATION
LJ007-0020 SWEARING AND TALKING OF WHAT CRIMES THEY HAD COMMITTED AND HOW THEY HAD DONE IT ANOTHER WITNESS DECLARED SHE HAD HEARD THE MOST SHOCKING LANGUAGE IN THE YARD SHE SAID
LJ007-0021 SHE HAD NEVER WITNESSED SUCH SCENES BEFORE AND HOPES SHE NEVER SHALL AGAIN  IT WAS DREADFUL
LJ007-0022 AFTER LOCKINGUP TIME WHICH VARIED AS ON THE MALE SIDE ACCORDING TO THE DAYLIGHT THE SCENES WERE OFTEN RIOTOUS AND DISGRACEFUL
LJ007-0023 THE POOR WHO COULD AFFORD NO LUXURIES WENT TO BED EARLY BUT WERE KEPT AWAKE BY THE REVELRIES OF THE RICH
LJ007-0024 WHO SUPPED ROYALLY ON THE SUPPLIES PROVIDED FROM OUTSIDE AND KEPT IT UP TILL TEN OR ELEVEN O'CLOCK
LJ007-0025 THERE WERE FREQUENT QUARRELS AND FIGHTS SHOES AND OTHER MISSILES WERE FREELY BANDIED ABOUT
LJ007-0026 AND WITH ALL THIS THE MOST DREADFUL OATHS THE WORST LANGUAGE TOO BAD TO BE REPEATED WERE MADE USE OF EVERY NIGHT
LJ007-0027 BAD AS WERE THE VARIOUS PARTS OF THE JAIL ALREADY DEALT WITH
LJ007-0028 THERE STILL REMAINED ONE WHERE THE GENERAL CALLOUS INDIFFERENCE AND MISMANAGEMENT CULMINATED IN CRUEL CULPABLE NEGLECT
LJ007-0029 THE CONDITION OF THE CAPITALLYCONVICTED PRISONERS AFTER SENTENCE WAS STILL VERY DISGRACEFUL. THE SIDE THEY OCCUPIED STILL KNOWN AS THE PRESSYARD
LJ007-0030 CONSISTED OF TWO DOZEN ROOMS AND FIFTEEN CELLS IN THESE VARIOUS CHAMBERS UNTIL JUST BEFORE THE INSPECTORS MADE THEIR REPORT
LJ007-0031 ALL CLASSES OF THE CONDEMNED THOSE CERTAIN TO SUFFER AND THE LARGER NUMBER WHO WERE NEARLY CERTAIN OF A REPRIEVE
LJ007-0032 WERE JUMBLED UP TOGETHER HIGGLEDYPIGGLEDY THE OLD AND THE YOUNG THE MURDERER AND THE CHILD WHO HAD BROKEN INTO A DWELLING
LJ007-0033 ALL PRIVACY WAS IMPOSSIBLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
LJ007-0034 AT TIMES THE NUMBERS CONGREGATED TOGETHER WERE VERY GREAT AS MANY AS FIFTY AND SIXTY EVEN MORE WERE CROWDED INDISCRIMINATELY INTO THE PRESSYARD
LJ007-0035 THE BETTERDISPOSED COMPLAINED BITTERLY OF WHAT THEY HAD TO ENDURE
LJ007-0036 ONE MAN DECLARED THAT THE LANGUAGE OF THE CONDEMNED ROOMS WAS DISGUSTING THAT HE WAS DYING A DEATH EVERY DAY IN BEING COMPELLED TO ASSOCIATE WITH SUCH CHARACTERS
LJ007-0037 IN THE MIDST OF THE NOISY AND BLASPHEMOUS TALK NO ONE COULD PURSUE HIS MEDITATIONS ANY WHO TRIED TO PRAY BECAME THE SPORT AND RIDICULE OF HIS BRUTAL FELLOWS
LJ007-0038 OWING TO THE REPEATED ENTREATIES OF THE CRIMINALS WHO COULD HARDLY HOPE TO ESCAPE THE GALLOWS SOME SHOW OF CLASSIFICATION WAS CARRIED OUT
LJ007-0039 AND WHEN THE INSPECTORS VISITED NEWGATE THEY FOUND THE THREE CERTAIN TO DIE IN A DAYROOM BY THEMSELVES
LJ007-0040 IN A SECOND ROOM WERE FOURTEEN MORE WHO HAD EVERY HOPE OF A REPRIEVE
LJ007-0041 THE WHOLE OF THESE SEVENTEEN HAD HOWEVER A COMMON AIRINGYARD AND TOOK THEIR EXERCISE THERE AT THE SAME TIME
LJ007-0042 SO THAT MEN IN THE MOST AWFUL SITUATION DAILY EXPECTING TO BE HANGED
LJ007-0043 WERE ASSOCIATED CONTINUALLY WITH A NUMBER OF THOSE WHO COULD LOOK WITH CERTAINTY ON A MITIGATION OF PUNISHMENT
LJ007-0044 THE LATTER LIGHTHEARTED AND RECKLESS CONDUCTED THEMSELVES IN THE MOST UNSEEMLY FASHION AND WITH AS MUCH INDIFFERENCE AS THE INMATES OF THE OTHER PARTS OF THE PRISON
LJ007-0045 THEY AMUSED THEMSELVES AFTER THEIR OWN FASHION PLAYED ALL DAY LONG AT BLINDMAN'SBUFF AND LEAPFROG OR BEAT EACH OTHER WITH A KNOTTED HANDKERCHIEF
LJ007-0046 LAUGHING AND UPROARIOUS UTTERLY UNMINDFUL OF THE COMPANIONSHIP OF MEN UPON WHOM LAY THE SHADOW OF AN IMPENDING SHAMEFUL DEATH
LJ007-0047 MEN WHOSE CASES WERE DANGEROUS AND THOSE MOST SERIOUSLY INCLINED COMPLAINED OF THESE ANNOYANCES
LJ007-0048 SO SUBVERSIVE OF MEDITATION SO DISTURBING TO THE THOUGHTS
LJ007-0049 THEY SUFFERED SICKENING ANXIETY AND WISHED TO BE LOCKED UP ALONE. THIS INDISCRIMINATE ASSOCIATION LASTED FOR MONTHS
LJ007-0050 DURING THE WHOLE OF WHICH TIME THE UNHAPPY CONVICTS WHO HAD BUT LITTLE HOPE OF COMMUTATION WERE EXPOSED TO THE MOCKERY OF THEIR RECKLESS ASSOCIATES
LJ007-0051 THE BRUTAL CALLOUSNESS OF THE BULK OF THE INMATES OF THE PRESSYARD MAY BE GATHERED FROM THE PRISON PUNISHMENTBOOK WHICH FREQUENTLY RECORDED SUCH ENTRIES AS THE FOLLOWING
LJ007-0052 BENJAMIN VINES AND DANIEL WARD PUT IN IRONS FOR TWO DAYS FOR BREAKING THE WINDOWS OF THE DAY ROOM IN THE CONDEMNED CELLS
LJ007-0053 JOSEPH COLEMAN PUT IN IRONS FOR THREE DAYS FOR STRIKING ONE OF THE PRISONERS IN THE SAME PLACE
LJ007-0054 THERE WERE DISPUTES AND QUARRELS CONSTANTLY AMONG THESE DOOMED MEN IT WAS A WORD AND BLOW AN ARGUMENT CLENCHED ALWAYS WITH A FIGHT
LJ007-0055 THE MORE PEACEABLY DISPOSED FOUND SOME OCCUPATION IN MAKING NEWGATE TOKENS
LJ007-0056 LEADEN HEARTS AND GRINDING THE IMPRESSIONS OFF PENNYPIECES THEN PRICKING FIGURES OR WORDS ON THEM TO GIVE TO THEIR FRIENDS AS MEMORIALS
LJ007-0057 TURNKEYS OCCASIONALLY VISITED THE PRESSYARD BUT ITS OCCUPANTS WERE UNDER LITTLE OR NO CONTROL
LJ007-0058 THE CHAPLAIN WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED TO MAKE THESE MEN HIS PECULIAR CARE AND WHO AT ONE TIME HAD VISITED THEM FREQUENTLY OFTEN SEVERAL TIMES A WEEK
LJ007-0059 HAD RELAXED HIS EFFORTS BECAUSE ACCORDING TO HIS OWN ACCOUNT HE WAS SO FREQUENTLY STOPPED IN THE PERFORMANCE OF HIS DUTIES
LJ007-0060 IN HIS EVIDENCE BEFORE THE INSPECTORS HE DECLARED THAT FOR YEARS HE GAVE HIS WHOLE TIME TO HIS DUTIES FROM AN EARLY HOUR IN THE MORNING TILL LATE IN THE AFTERNOON
LJ007-0061 HE LEFT OFF BECAUSE HE WAS SO MUCH INTERFERED WITH AND LAUGHED AT AND FROM SEEING THAT NO SUCCESS ATTENDED HIS EFFORTS OWING TO THE EVILS ARISING FROM ASSOCIATION
LJ007-0062 LATTERLY HIS MINISTRATIONS TO THE CONDEMNED HAD BEEN RESTRICTED TO A VISIT ON SUNDAY AFTERNOONS AND OCCASIONALLY ABOUT ONCE A FORTNIGHT ON A WEEKDAY
LJ007-0063 IT IS ONLY FAIR TO MR. COTTON TO ADD THAT ACCORDING TO HIS OWN JOURNAL HE WAS UNREMITTING IN HIS ATTENTIONS TO CONVICTS WHO WERE ACTUALLY CAST FOR DEATH
LJ007-0064 AND THE DAY OF WHOSE EXECUTION WAS FIXED. HE HAD NO DOUBT A DIFFICULT MISSION TO DISCHARGE
LJ007-0065 ON THE ONE HAND THE LADIES' ASSOCIATION SUPPORTED AND ENCOURAGED BY PUBLIC APPROVAL TRENCHED UPON HIS PECULIAR PROVINCE
LJ007-0066 ON THE OTHER THE GOVERNOR OF THE JAIL SNEERED AT HIS ZEAL
LJ007-0067 STIGMATIZED HIS OFTEN MOST JUST STRICTURES ON ABUSES AS A BUNDLE OF NONSENSE AND THE ALDERMEN WHEN HE APPEALED TO THEM FOR PROTECTION AND COUNTENANCE
LJ007-0068 GENERALLY SIDED WITH HIS OPPONENTS. NEVERTHELESS THE INSPECTORS SUMMED UP AGAINST HIM
LJ007-0069 WHILE ADMITTING THAT HE HAD HAD MANY DIFFICULTIES TO CONTEND WITH
LJ007-0070 AND THAT HE HAD AGAIN AND AGAIN PROTESTED AGAINST THE OBSTACLES THROWN IN HIS WAY THE INSPECTORS CANNOT FORBEAR EXPRESSING THEIR OPINION THAT HE MIGHT HAVE SHOWN GREATER PERSEVERANCE
LJ007-0071 IN THE FACE OF IMPEDIMENTS CONFESSEDLY DISCOURAGING
LJ007-0072 AS REGARDS THE PRIVATE TEACHING OF PRISONERS AND THEY WENT ON TO SAY THAT A RESOLVED ADHERENCE IN SPITE OF DISCOURAGEMENTS THE MOST DISHEARTENING
LJ007-0073 TO THAT LINE OF CONDUCT WHICH HIS DUTY IMPOSED ON HIM
LJ007-0074 WOULD IT IS PROBABLE HAVE EVENTUALLY OVERCOME THE RELUCTANCE OF SOME OF THE PRISONERS AT LEAST AND WOULD HAVE POSSESSED SO MUCH MORAL DIGNITY
LJ007-0075 AS EFFECTUALLY TO REBUKE AND ABASH THE PROFANE SPIRIT OF THE MORE INSOLENT AND DARING OF THE CRIMINALS
LJ007-0076 THE LAX DISCIPLINE MAINTAINED IN NEWGATE WAS STILL FURTHER DETERIORATED BY THE PRESENCE OF TWO OTHER CLASSES OF PRISONERS WHO OUGHT NEVER TO HAVE BEEN INMATES OF SUCH A JAIL
LJ007-0077 ONE OF THESE WERE THE CRIMINAL LUNATICS WHO WERE AT THIS TIME AND FOR LONG PREVIOUS CONTINUOUSLY IMPRISONED THERE
LJ007-0078 AS THE LAW STOOD SINCE THE PASSING OF THE 9TH GEORGE IV. C. 40 ANY TWO JUSTICES MIGHT REMOVE A PRISONER FOUND TO BE INSANE EITHER ON COMMITMENT
LJ007-0079 OR ARRAIGNMENT TO AN ASYLUM AND THE SECRETARY OF STATE HAD THE SAME POWER AS REGARDS ANY WHO BECAME INSANE WHILE UNDERGOING SENTENCE
LJ007-0080 THESE POWERS WERE NOT INVARIABLY PUT IN FORCE AND THERE WERE IN CONSEQUENCE MANY UNHAPPY LUNATICS IN NEWGATE AND OTHER JAILS
LJ007-0081 WHOSE PROPER PLACE WAS THE ASYLUM
LJ007-0082 AT THE TIME THE LORDS' COMMITTEE SAT THERE WERE EIGHT THUS RETAINED IN NEWGATE AND A RETURN IN THE APPENDIX OF THE LORDS' REPORT
LJ007-0083 GIVES A TOTAL OF THIRTYNINE LUNATICS CONFINED IN VARIOUS JAILS MANY OF THEM GUILTY OF MURDER AND OTHER SERIOUS CRIMES
LJ007-0084 THE INSPECTORS IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR ON EXAMINING THE FACTS FOUND THAT SOME OF THESE POOR CREATURES HAD BEEN IN CONFINEMENT FOR LONG PERIODS
LJ007-0085 AT NEWGATE AND YORK CASTLE AS LONG AS FIVE YEARS AT ILCHESTER AND MORPETH FOR SEVEN YEARS AT WARWICK FOR EIGHT YEARS
LJ007-0086 AT BUCKINGHAM AND HEREFORD FOR ELEVEN YEARS
LJ007-0087 AT APPLEBY FOR THIRTEEN YEARS AT ANGLESEA FOR FIFTEEN YEARS AT EXETER FOR SIXTEEN YEARS AND AT PEMBROKE
LJ007-0088 FOR NOT LESS A PERIOD THAN TWENTYFOUR YEARS
LJ007-0089 IT WAS MANIFESTLY WRONG THAT SUCH PERSONS VISITED BY THE MOST AWFUL OF CALAMITIES SHOULD BE DETAINED IN A COMMON PRISON
LJ007-0090 NOT ONLY DID THEIR PRESENCE TEND GREATLY TO INTERFERE WITH THE DISCIPLINE OF THE PRISON BUT THEIR CONDITION WAS DEPLORABLE IN THE EXTREME
LJ007-0091 THE LUNATIC BECAME THE SPORT OF THE IDLE AND THE DEPRAVED. HIS CURE WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION
LJ007-0092 HE WAS PLACED IN A SITUATION BEYOND ALL OTHERS CALCULATED TO CONFIRM HIS MALADY AND PROLONG HIS SUFFERINGS
LJ007-0093 THE MATTER WAS STILL FURTHER COMPLICATED AT NEWGATE BY THE PRESENCE WITHIN THE WALLS OF SHAM LUNATICS. SOME OF THOSE INCLUDED IN THE CATEGORY
LJ007-0094 HAD ACTUALLY BEEN RETURNED AS SANE FROM THE ASYLUM TO WHICH THEY HAD BEEN SENT AND THERE WAS ALWAYS SOME UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHO WAS MAD AND WHO NOT
LJ007-0095 PRISONERS INDEED WERE KNOWN TO BOAST THAT THEY HAD SAVED THEIR NECKS BY FEIGNING INSANITY
LJ007-0096 IT WAS HIGH TIME THAT THE UNSATISFACTORY STATE OF THE LAW AS REGARDS THE TREATMENT OF CRIMINAL LUNATICS SHOULD BE REMEDIED
LJ007-0097 AND NOT THE LEAST OF THE GOOD SERVICES RENDERED BY THE NEW INSPECTORS WAS THEIR INQUIRY INTO THE STATUS OF THESE UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE AND THEIR RECOMMENDATION TO IMPROVE IT
LJ007-0098 THE OTHER INMATES OF THE PRISON OF AN EXCEPTIONAL CHARACTER AND EXEMPTED FROM THE REGULAR DISCIPLINE SUCH AS IT WAS
LJ007-0099 WERE THE TEN PERSONS COMMITTED TO NEWGATE BY THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE
LJ007-0100 THESE WERE THE GENTLEMEN CONCERNED IN THE BRIBERY CASE AT IPSWICH IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE
LJ007-0101 WHEN A PETITION WAS PRESENTED AGAINST THE RETURN OF MESSRS. ADAM DUNDAS AND FITZROY KELLY VARIOUS WITNESSES INCLUDING MESSRS. J. B. DASENT
LJ007-0102 PILGRIM BOND AND CLAMP HAD REFUSED TO GIVE EVIDENCE BEFORE THE HOUSE OF COMMONS' COMMITTEE A SPEAKER'S WARRANT WAS ISSUED FOR THEIR ARREST WHEN THEY ABSCONDED
LJ007-0103 MR. J. E. SPARROW AND MR. CLIPPERTON
LJ007-0104 THE PARLIAMENTARY AGENTS OF THE MEMBERS WHOSE ELECTION WAS IMPUGNED WERE IMPLICATED IN AIDING AND ABETTING THE OTHERS TO ABSCOND AND A MR. O'MALLY
LJ007-0105 COUNSEL FOR THE TWO M.P.'S WAS ALSO CONCERNED
LJ007-0106 PILGRIM AND DASENT WERE CAUGHT AND GIVEN INTO THE CUSTODY OF THE SERGEANTATARMS AND THE REST WERE EITHER ARRESTED OR THEY SURRENDERED
LJ007-0107 A RESOLUTION AT ONCE PASSED THE HOUSE WITHOUT DIVISION TO COMMIT THE WHOLE TO NEWGATE WHERE THEY REMAINED FOR VARIOUS TERMS
LJ007-0108 DASENT AND PILGRIM WERE RELEASED IN TEN DAYS ON MAKING DUE SUBMISSION
LJ007-0109 O'MALLY SENT IN A MEDICAL CERTIFICATE DECLARING THAT THE IMPRISONMENT WAS ENDANGERING HIS LIFE AND AFTER SOME QUESTION HE WAS ALSO RELEASED
LJ007-0110 THE REST WERE DETAINED FOR MORE THAN A MONTH IT BEING CONSIDERED THAT THEY WERE THE MOST GUILTY AS BEING EITHER PROFESSIONAL AGENTS WHO ADVISED THE OTHERS TO ABSCOND
LJ007-0111 OR WITNESSES WHO DID NOT VOLUNTARILY COME FORWARD WHEN THE CHANCE WAS GIVEN THEM
LJ007-0112 MANY OF THE OLD CUSTOMS ONCE PREVALENT IN THE STATE SIDE SO PROPERLY CONDEMNED AND ABOLISHED
LJ007-0113 WERE REVIVED FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THESE GENTLEMEN WHOSE INCARCERATION WAS THUS RENDERED AS LITTLE LIKE IMPRISONMENT AS POSSIBLE
LJ007-0114 A CERTAIN NUMBER WHO COULD AFFORD THE HIGH RATE OF A GUINEA PER DIEM FIXED BY THE UNDER SHERIFF WERE LODGED IN THE GOVERNOR'S HOUSE
LJ007-0115 SLEPT THERE AND HAD THEIR MEALS PROVIDED FOR THEM FROM THE SESSIONS HOUSE OR LONDON COFFEEHOUSE
LJ007-0116 A FEW OTHERS WHO COULD NOT AFFORD A PAYMENT OF MORE THAN HALF A GUINEA WERE PERMITTED TO MONOPOLIZE A PART OF THE PRISON INFIRMARY
LJ007-0117 WHERE THE UPPER WARD WAS EXCLUSIVELY APPROPRIATED TO THEIR USE THEY ALSO HAD THEIR MEALS SENT IN AND WITH THE FOOD WINE ALMOST AD LIBITUM
LJ007-0118 A PRISONER ONE OF THE WARDSMEN WAITED ON THOSE IN THE INFIRMARY THE OCCUPANTS OF THE GOVERNOR'S HOUSE HAD THEIR OWN SERVANTS OR THE GOVERNOR'S
LJ007-0119 AS A RULE VISITORS MANY OF THEM PERSONS OF GOOD POSITION CAME AND WENT ALL DAY LONG AND AS LATE AS NINE AT NIGHT
LJ007-0120 SOME TO THE INFIRMARY MANY MORE TO THE GOVERNOR'S HOUSE
LJ007-0121 THERE WERE NO RESTRAINTS CARDS AND BACKGAMMON WERE PLAYED AND THE TIME PASSED IN FEASTING AND REVELRY
LJ007-0122 EVEN MR. COPE ADMITTED THAT THE COMMITTAL OF THIS CLASS OF PRISONERS TO NEWGATE WAS MOST INCONVENIENT
LJ007-0123 AND THE INSPECTORS EXPRESSED THEMSELVES STILL MORE STRONGLY IN REPREHENSION OF THE PRACTICE
LJ007-0124 THE INFIRMARY AT THIS PARTICULAR PERIOD EPITOMIZED THE CONDITION OF THE JAIL AT LARGE
LJ007-0125 IT WAS DIVERTED FROM ITS PROPER USES AND AS THE PLACE OF THE GREATEST COMFORT WAS ALLOTTED TO PERSONS WHO SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SENT TO NEWGATE AT ALL
LJ007-0126 ALL THE EVILS OF INDISCRIMINATE ASSOCIATION WERE STRONGLY ACCENTUATED BY THE CROWD COLLECTED WITHIN ITS NARROW LIMITS
LJ007-0127 IT MAY EASILY BE IMAGINED SAY THE INSPECTORS IN SPEAKING OF THE PRISON GENERALLY
LJ007-0128 WHAT MUST BE THE STATE OF DISCIPLINE IN A PLACE FILLED WITH CHARACTERS SO VARIOUS AS WERE ASSEMBLED THERE WHERE THE TRIED AND THE UNTRIED THE SICK AND THE HEALTHY
LJ007-0129 THE SANE AND THE INSANE THE YOUNG AND THE OLD THE TRIVIAL OFFENDER AND THE MAN ABOUT TO SUFFER THE EXTREME PENALTY OF THE LAW
LJ007-0130 ARE ALL HUDDLED TOGETHER WITHOUT DISCRIMINATION OVERSIGHT OR CONTROL
LJ007-0131 ENOUGH HAS PROBABLY BEEN EXTRACTED FROM THIS MOST DAMNATORY REPORT TO GIVE A COMPLETE PICTURE OF THE DISGRACEFUL STATE IN WHICH NEWGATE STILL REMAINED IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE
LJ007-0132 THE INSPECTORS HOWEVER HONESTLY ADMITTED THAT ALTHOUGH THE SITE OF THE PRISON WAS CONVENIENT ITS CONSTRUCTION WAS AS BAD AS BAD COULD BE
LJ007-0133 VALUABLE SPACE WAS CUMBERED WITH MANY LONG AND WINDING PASSAGES NUMEROUS STAIRCASES AND UNNECESSARILY THICK AND CUMBROUS INNER WALLS
LJ007-0134 THE WARDS WERE IN SOME CASES SPACIOUS BUT THEY WERE ENTIRELY UNSUITED FOR SEPARATION OR THE INSPECTION OF PRISONERS
LJ007-0135 THE YARDS WERE NARROW AND CONFINED MAINLY BECAUSE THE GROUND PLAN WAS RADICALLY VICIOUS. THESE WERE EVILS INSEPARABLE FROM THE PLACE
LJ007-0136 BUT THERE WERE OTHERS REMEDIABLE UNDER A BETTER SYSTEM OF MANAGEMENT
LJ007-0137 MORE ATTENTION TO VENTILATION WHICH WAS ALTOGETHER NEGLECTED AND INADEQUATE WOULD HAVE SECURED A BETTER ATMOSPHERE FOR THE UNHAPPY INMATES
LJ007-0138 WHO CONSTANTLY BREATHED AN AIR HEAVY AND WHEN THE WARDS WERE FIRST OPENED IN THE MORNING PARTICULARLY OFFENSIVE
LJ007-0139 AGAIN THE DISCIPLINE COMMONLY DEEMED INSEPARABLE FROM EVERY PLACE OF DURANCE WAS ENTIRELY WANTING
LJ007-0140 THE PRIMARY OBJECT OF COMMITTING A PRISONER TO JAIL AS THE INSPECTORS POINTED OUT WAS TO DETER NOT ONLY THE CRIMINAL HIMSELF BUT OTHERS FROM CRIME
LJ007-0141 AND TO DISPOSE HIM BY MEDITATION AND SECLUSION TO RETURN TO AN HONEST LIFE
LJ007-0142 BUT AT NEWGATE THE CONVICTED PRISONER INSTEAD OF PRIVATION AND HARD FARE
LJ007-0143 IS PERMITTED TO PURCHASE WHATEVER HIS OWN MEANS OR THE MEANS OF HIS FRIENDS IN OR OUT OF PRISON CAN AFFORD
LJ007-0144 AND HE CAN ALMOST INVARIABLY PROCURE THE LUXURIES OF HIS CLASS OF LIFE BEER AND TOBACCO IN ABUNDANCE
LJ007-0145 INSTEAD OF SECLUSION AND MEDITATION HIS TIME IS PASSED IN THE MIDST OF A BODY OF CRIMINALS OF EVERY CLASS AND DEGREE IN RIOT DEBAUCHERY AND GAMING
LJ007-0146 VAUNTING HIS OWN ADVENTURES OR LISTENING TO THOSE OF OTHERS
LJ007-0147 COMMUNICATING HIS OWN SKILL AND APTITUDE IN CRIME OR ACQUIRING THE LESSONS OF GREATER ADEPTS. HE HAS ACCESS TO NEWSPAPERS AND OF COURSE
LJ007-0148 PREFERS THAT DESCRIPTION WHICH ARE EXPRESSLY PREPARED FOR HIS OWN CLASS AND WHICH ABOUND IN VULGAR ADVENTURE IN CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE AND IN THE HISTORIES OF THE POLICE
LJ007-0149 THE JAIL AND THE SCAFFOLD
LJ007-0150 HE IS ALLOWED INTERCOURSE WITH PROSTITUTES WHO IN NINE CASES OUT OF TEN HAVE ORIGINALLY CONDUCED TO HIS RUIN
LJ007-0151 AND HIS CONNECTION WITH THEM IS CONFIRMED BY THAT DEVOTION AND GENEROSITY TOWARDS THEIR PARAMOURS IN ADVERSITY FOR WHICH THESE OTHERWISE DEGRADED WOMEN ARE REMARKABLE
LJ007-0152 HAVING THUS PASSED HIS TIME HE RETURNS A GREATER ADEPT IN CRIME WITH A WIDER ACQUAINTANCE AMONG CRIMINALS AND WHAT PERHAPS IS EVEN MORE INJURIOUS TO HIM
LJ007-0153 IS GENERALLY KNOWN TO ALL THE WORST MEN IN THE COUNTRY NOT ONLY WITHOUT THE INCLINATION BUT ALMOST WITHOUT THE ABILITY OF RETURNING TO AN HONEST LIFE
LJ007-0154 THESE PUNGENT AND WELLGROUNDED STRICTURES APPLIED WITH STILL GREATER FORCE TO THE UNCONVICTED PRISONER THE MAN WHO CAME TO THE PRISON INNOCENT AND STILL UNCONTAMINATED
LJ007-0155 TO BE SUBJECTED TO THE SAME BANEFUL INFLUENCES AND TO SUFFER THE SAME MORAL DETERIORATION WHETHER ULTIMATELY CONVICTED OR SET FREE
LJ007-0156 THE WHOLE SYSTEM OR MORE CORRECTLY THE WANT OF SYSTEM WAS BANEFUL AND PERNICIOUS TO THE LAST DEGREE
LJ007-0157 THE EVILS OF SUCH ASSOCIATION WERE AGGRAVATED BY THE UNBROKEN IDLENESS ONE EVIL INFLAMED THE OTHER REFORMATION
LJ007-0158 OR ANY KIND OF MORAL IMPROVEMENT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THE PRISONER'S CAREER WAS INEVITABLY DOWNWARD TILL HE STRUCK THE LOWEST DEPTHS
LJ007-0159 FORCED AND CONSTANT INTERCOURSE WITH THE MOST DEPRAVED INDIVIDUALS OF HIS OWN CLASS
LJ007-0160 THE EMPLOYMENT OF THOSE MEANS AND AGENTS BY WHICH THE LOWEST PASSIONS AND THE MOST VULGAR PROPENSITIES OF MAN ARE PERPETUALLY KEPT IN THE HIGHEST STATE OF EXCITEMENT
LJ007-0161 DRINK GAMING OBSCENE AND BLASPHEMOUS LANGUAGE UTTER IDLENESS THE ALMOST UNRESTRICTED ADMISSION OF MONEY AND LUXURIES
LJ007-0162 UNCONTROLLED CONVERSATION WITH VISITORS OF THE VERY WORST DESCRIPTION  PROSTITUTES THIEVES RECEIVERS OF STOLEN GOODS
LJ007-0163 ALL THE TUMULTUOUS AND DIVERSIFIED PASSIONS AND EMOTIONS WHICH CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE THESE MUST NECESSARILY GENERATE
LJ007-0164 FORBID THE FAINTEST SHADOW OF A HOPE THAT IN A SOIL SO UNFAVORABLE FOR MORAL CULTURE
LJ007-0165 ANY AWAKENING TRUTH SALUTARY EXHORTATION OR IMPERFECT RESOLUTIONS OF AMENDMENT CAN TAKE ROOT OR GROW
LJ007-0166 STRONG AS WERE THE FOREGOING REMARKS THE INSPECTORS WOUND UP THEIR REPORT IN STILL MORE TRENCHANT LANGUAGE
LJ007-0167 FRAMING A TERRIBLE INDICTMENT AGAINST THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDITION OF NEWGATE. THEIR WORDS DESERVE TO BE QUOTED IN FULL
LJ007-0168 WE CANNOT CLOSE THESE REMARKS SAY THE INSPECTORS WITHOUT AN EXPRESSION OF THE PAINFUL FEELINGS WITH WHICH WE SUBMIT TO YOUR LORDSHIP
LJ007-0169 THIS PICTURE OF THE EXISTING STATE OF NEWGATE
LJ007-0170 THAT IN THIS VAST METROPOLIS THE CENTER OF WEALTH CIVILIZATION AND INFORMATION
LJ007-0171 DISTINGUISHED AS THE SEAT OF RELIGION WORTH AND PHILANTHROPY
LJ007-0172 WHERE IS TO BE FOUND IN OPERATION EVERY EXPEDIENT BY WHICH IGNORANCE MAY BE SUPERSEDED BY KNOWLEDGE IDLENESS BY INDUSTRY AND SUFFERING BY BENEVOLENCE
LJ007-0173 THAT IN THE METROPOLIS OF THIS HIGHLYFAVORED COUNTRY TO WHICH THE EYES OF OTHER LANDS TURN FOR EXAMPLE A SYSTEM OF PRISON DISCIPLINE SUCH AS THAT ENFORCED IN NEWGATE
LJ007-0174 SHOULD BE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS IN UNDISTURBED OPERATION NOT ONLY IN CONTEMPT OF RELIGION AND HUMANITY
LJ007-0175 BUT IN OPPOSITION TO THE RECORDED DENUNCIATIONS OF AUTHORITY AND IN DEFIANCE OF THE EXPRESS ENACTMENTS OF THE LAW
LJ007-0176 IS INDEED A SUBJECT WHICH CANNOT BUT IMPRESS EVERY CONSIDERATE MIND WITH HUMILIATION AND SORROW
LJ007-0177 WE TRUST HOWEVER THAT THE DAY IS AT HAND WHEN THIS STAIN WILL BE REMOVED FROM THE CHARACTER OF THE CITY OF LONDON
LJ007-0178 AND WHEN THE FIRST MUNICIPAL AUTHORITY OF OUR LAND WILL BE NO LONGER SUBJECTED TO THE REPROACH OF FOSTERING AN INSTITUTION WHICH OUTRAGES THE RIGHTS AND FEELINGS OF HUMANITY
LJ007-0179 DEFEATS THE ENDS OF JUSTICE AND DISGRACES THE PROFESSION OF A CHRISTIAN COUNTRY
LJ007-0180 THE PUBLICATION OF THIS REPORT RAISED A STORM IN THE CITY AND THE CORPORATION WAS ROUSED TO MAKE AN IMMEDIATE PROTEST
LJ007-0181 A COMMITTEE OF ALDERMEN WAS FORTHWITH APPOINTED TO REPORT UPON THE INSPECTORS' REPORT
LJ007-0182 AND THE RESULT WAS ANOTHER LENGTHY BLUE BOOK PRINTED IN THE PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS EIGHTEEN THIRTY SIX
LJ007-0183 TRAVERSING WHERE IT WAS POSSIBLE THE STATEMENTS OF THE INSPECTORS AND OFFERING EXPLANATION AND PALLIATION OF SUCH EVILS AS COULD NOT BE DENIED
LJ007-0184 THE INSPECTORS RETORTED WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME REITERATING THEIR CHARGES AND POINTING OUT THAT THE COMMITTEE OF ALDERMEN BY ITS OWN ADMISSION
LJ007-0185 JUSTIFIED THE ORIGINAL ALLEGATIONS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DENY THE INDISCRIMINATE ASSOCIATION THE GAMBLING DRINKING SMOKING QUARRELING IN THE JAIL
LJ007-0186 THE UNDUE AUTHORITY GIVEN TO PRISONERS THE LEVYING OF GARNISH UNDER ANOTHER NAME
LJ007-0187 THE NEGLECT OF THE CONDEMNED CONVICTS THE FILTHY CONDITION OF THE WARDS THE INSUFFICIENCY OF BEDDING AND CLOTHING
LJ007-0188 THE MISEMPLOYMENT OF OFFICERS AND PRISONERS BY THE GOVERNOR
LJ007-0189 THE CORPORATION EVIDENTLY HAD THE WORST OF IT AND BEGAN TO FEEL THE NECESSITY FOR UNDERTAKING THE GREAT WORK OF REFORM
LJ007-0190 NEXT YEAR WE FIND THE INSPECTORS EXPRESSING THEIR SATISFACTION THAT THE FULL AND FAITHFUL EXPOSURE WHICH WE FELT IT OUR DUTY TO MAKE OF NEWGATE
LJ007-0191 HAS BEEN PRODUCTIVE OF AT LEAST SOME ADVANTAGE
LJ007-0192 INASMUCH AS IT HAS AROUSED THE ATTENTION OF THOSE UPON WHOM PARLIAMENTARY REPORTS AND GRAND JURY PRESENTMENTS HAD HITHERTO FAILED TO MAKE THE SLIGHTEST IMPRESSION
LJ007-0193 THE MEASURES OF IMPROVEMENT INTRODUCED WERE MAINLY AS FOLLOWS
LJ007-0194 THE FIXING OF INSPECTION HOLES IN THE DOORS AND WALLS SO AS TO INSURE MORE SUPERVISION OF WINDOWS OPENING INTO THE WELLHOLES
LJ007-0195 TO GIVE BETTER LIGHT AND VENTILATION THE CONSTRUCTION OF BEDPLACES THREE TIERS HIGH ALONGSIDE THE WALLS FOR MALES TWO TIERS FOR FEMALES
LJ007-0196 THE PROVISION OF DININGROOMS AND DININGTABLES
LJ007-0197 THE INFIRMARY WAS ENLARGED THE ADMISSION OF VISITORS LIMITED AND THE PASSING OF ARTICLES PREVENTED BY A WIRE SCREEN
LJ007-0198 THE WINDOWS WERE TO BE GLAZED AND PAINTED TO PREVENT PRISONERS FROM LOOKING OUT
LJ007-0199 BATHS FUMIGATING PLACES FOR CLOTHING WASHHOUSE AND THE REMOVAL OF DUSTBINS COMPLETED THE NEW ARRANGEMENTS IN THE MAIN PRISON
LJ007-0200 IN THE PRESSYARD THE PRESSROOM AND WARD ABOVE IT WERE PARCELED OUT INTO NINE SEPARATE SLEEPING CELLS
LJ007-0201 EACH WAS PROVIDED WITH AN IRON BEDSTEAD AND A SMALL DESK AT WHICH THE CONDEMNED MAN MIGHT READ OR WRITE
LJ007-0202 BUT THE ONE GREAT AND MOST CRYING EVIL REMAINED UNREMEDIED
LJ007-0203 THE MISCHIEF OF JAIL ASSOCIATIONS SAY THE INSPECTORS
LJ007-0204 WHICH HAS BEEN DEMONSTRABLY PROVED TO BE THE FRUITFUL SOURCE OF ALL THE ABUSES AND IRREGULARITIES WHICH HAVE SO LONG DISGRACED NEWGATE
LJ007-0205 IS NOT ONLY PERMITTED STILL TO EXIST IN THE PRISON BUT IS RENDERED MORE POWERFUL THAN BEFORE
LJ007-0206 IN ENDEAVORING TO ARREST CONTAMINATION PRISONERS WERE MORE CLOSELY CONFINED AND ASSOCIATED IN SMALLER NUMBERS
LJ007-0207 BUT THIS HAD THE EFFECT OF THROWING THEM INTO CLOSER CONTACT AND OF MAKING THEM MORE INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH MORE DIRECTLY INFLUENTIAL UPON ONE ANOTHER
LJ007-0208 IN THE INSPECTORS' FOURTH REPORT DATED EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE
LJ007-0209 THEY RETURN TO THE CHARGE AND AGAIN CALL THE CORPORATION TO TASK FOR THEIR MISMANAGEMENT OF NEWGATE
LJ007-0210 ABUSES AND IRREGULARITIES WHICH HAD BEEN PARTIALLY REMEDIED BY THE REFORM INTRODUCED IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN WERE ONCE MORE IN THE ASCENDANT
LJ007-0211 IN OUR LATE VISITS THEY SAY WE HAVE SEEN MANIFEST INDICATIONS OF A RETROGRADE MOVEMENT IN THIS RESPECT
LJ007-0212 AND A TENDENCY TO RETURN TO MUCH OF THAT LAXITY AND REMISSNESS WHICH FORMERLY MARKED THE MANAGEMENT OF THIS PRISON
LJ007-0213 AGAIN THE FOLLOWING YEAR THE INSPECTORS REPEAT THEIR CHARGE
LJ007-0214 THE PROMINENT EVILS OF THIS PRISON NEWGATE  EVILS WHICH THE ALTERATIONS MADE WITHIN THE LAST FOUR YEARS HAVE FAILED TO REMOVE
LJ007-0215 ARE THE ASSOCIATION OF PRISONERS AND THE UNUSUAL CONTAMINATION TO WHICH SUCH ASSOCIATION GIVES RISE
LJ007-0216 FOR NEARLY TWENTYTWO HOURS OUT OF THE TWENTYFOUR THE PRISONERS ARE LOCKED UP DURING WHICH TIME NO OFFICER IS STATIONED IN THE WARD WITH THEM
LJ007-0217 THEY GO ON TO SAY
LJ007-0218 NEWGATE IS ONLY LESS EXTENSIVELY INJURIOUS THAN FORMERLY BECAUSE IT IS LESS CROWDED
LJ007-0219 THE EFFECTS OF THE IMPRISONMENT ARE TO VITIATE ITS INMATES TO EXTEND THEIR ACQUAINTANCESHIP WITH EACH OTHER
LJ007-0220 TO CORRUPT THE PRISONER CHARGED WITH AN OFFENSE OF WHICH HE MAY BE INNOCENT AND TO CONFIRM IN GUILT THE YOUNG AND INEXPERIENCED OFFENDER
LJ007-0221 THE REPORTS AS THE YEARS FLOW ON REITERATE THE SAME COMPLAINTS
LJ007-0222 MUCH BITTERNESS OF FEELING IS EVIDENTLY ENGENDERED AND THE CORPORATION GROWS MORE AND MORE ANGRY WITH THE INSPECTORS
LJ007-0223 THE PRISON OFFICIALS APPEAR TO BE ON THE SIDE OF THE INSPECTORS TO THE GREAT DISSATISFACTION OF THE CORPORATION WHO CLAIMED THE FULL ALLEGIANCE AND SUPPORT OF ITS SERVANTS
LJ007-0224 IN A RESOLUTION PASSED BY THE COURT OF ALDERMEN ON 18TH MARCH EIGHTEEN FORTY TWO
LJ007-0225 I FIND IT ORDERED THAT THE ORDINARY OF NEWGATE BE RESTRICTED FROM MAKING ANY COMMUNICATIONS TO THE HOME OFFICE
LJ007-0226 OR THE INSPECTORS OF PRISONS AND THAT HE BE REQUIRED WHOLLY TO CONFINE HIMSELF TO THE PERFORMANCE OF HIS DUTY AS PRESCRIBED BY ACT OF PARLIAMENT
LJ007-0227 THE INSPECTORS WERE NOT TO BE DETERRED HOWEVER BY ANY OPPOSITION FROM THE EARNEST DISCHARGE OF THEIR FUNCTIONS AND CONTINUED TO REPORT AGAINST NEWGATE
LJ007-0228 IN THEIR TENTH REPORT
LJ007-0229 THEY STATE THAT THEY ARE COMPELLED BY AN IMPERATIVE SENSE OF DUTY TO ADVERT IN TERMS OF DECIDED CONDEMNATION TO THE LAMENTABLE CONDITION OF THE PRISONS OF THE CITY OF LONDON
LJ007-0230 NEWGATE GILTSPUR ST. COMPTER AND THE CITY BRIDEWELL
LJ007-0231 IN WHICH THE MASTER EVIL OF JAIL ASSOCIATION AND CONSEQUENT CONTAMINATION STILL CONTINUES TO OPERATE DIRECTLY TO THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF CRIME
LJ007-0232 THE PLAN ADOPTED FOR VENTILATING THE DININGROOM ON THE 'MASTER'S SIDE' AND THAT OF THE MIDDLE YARD IS VERY INEFFICIENT
LJ007-0233 IT CONSISTS OF SEVERAL CIRCULAR PERFORATIONS ABOUT TWO INCHES IN DIAMETER
LJ007-0234 SLANTING DOWNWARDS FROM THE TOP OF THE WALLS TO THE OUTSIDE ADJOINING THE SLAUGHTERHOUSES OF NEWGATE MARKET AND OCCASIONALLY IN HOT WEATHER
LJ007-0235 INSTEAD OF VENTILATING THE APARTMENTS THEY ONLY SERVE TO CONVEY THE OFFENSIVE EFFLUVIA ARISING FROM THE DECAYING ANIMAL MATTER INTO THE DININGROOMS
LJ007-0236 SOMETIMES THE STENCH IN HOT WEATHER IS SAID TO BE VERY BAD
LJ007-0237 MANY RATS ALSO COME THROUGH THESE SOCALLED VENTILATORS AS THEY OPEN CLOSE TO THE GROUND AT THE BACK OF THE PRISON
LJ007-0238 AT THE SAME TIME THE INSPECTORS ANIMADVERT STRONGLY UPON THE MISCONDUCT OF PRISONERS AND THE FREQUENCY OF PRISON PUNISHMENTS
LJ007-0239 BOTH OFFENSES AND PUNISHMENTS AFFORDING A SUFFICIENT INDEX TO THE PRACTICES GOING FORWARD AND THEY WIND UP BY DECLARING
LJ007-0240 THAT A STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR DUTIES GAVE THEM NO CHOICE BUT TO REPORT MATTERS AS WE FOUND THEM
LJ007-0241 AND AGAIN AND AGAIN TO PROTEST AGAINST NEWGATE AS IT AT PRESENT EXISTS
LJ007-0242 NO COMPLETE AND PERMANENT IMPROVEMENT WAS INDEED POSSIBLE WHILE NEWGATE REMAINED UNCHANGED
LJ007-0243 IT WAS NOT TILL THE ERECTION OF THE NEW PRISON AT HOLLOWAY IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY AND THE ENTIRE INTERNAL RECONSTRUCTION OF NEWGATE ACCORDING TO NEW IDEAS
LJ008-0001 THE CHRONICLES OF NEWGATE VOLUME TWO BY ARTHUR GRIFFITHS SECTION ELEVEN EXECUTIONS PART ONE
LJ008-0002 I PROPOSE TO RETURN NOW TO THE SUBJECT OF NEWGATE EXECUTIONS
LJ008-0003 WHICH WE LEFT AT THE TIME OF THE DISCONTINUANCE OF THE LONGPRACTICED PROCESSION TO TYBURN
LJ008-0004 THE REASONS FOR THIS CHANGE WERE FULLY SET FORTH IN A PREVIOUS CHAPTER
LJ008-0005 THE TERRIBLE SPECTACLE WAS AS DEMORALIZING TO THE PUBLIC FOR WHOSE ADMONITION IT WAS INTENDED
LJ008-0006 AS THE EXPOSURE WAS BRUTAL AND CRUEL TOWARDS THE PRINCIPAL ACTORS
LJ008-0007 THE DECISION TO REMOVE THE SCENE OF ACTION TO THE IMMEDIATE FRONT OF THE JAIL ITSELF
LJ008-0008 WAS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AS MAKING THE PERFORMANCE SHORTER AND DIMINISHING THE AREA OF DISPLAY
LJ008-0009 BUT THE OLD BAILEY WAS NOT EXCLUSIVELY USED
LJ008-0010 AT FIRST AND FOR SOME FEW YEARS AFTER 1784 EXECUTIONS TOOK PLACE OCCASIONALLY AT A DISTANCE FROM NEWGATE
LJ008-0011 THIS WAS PARTLY DUE TO THE SURVIVAL OF THE OLD NOTION THAT THE SCENE OF THE CRIME OUGHT ALSO TO WITNESS THE RETRIBUTION
LJ008-0012 PARTLY PERHAPS BECAUSE RESIDENTS IN AND ABOUT THE OLD BAILEY RAISED A LOUD PROTEST AGAINST THE CONSTANT ERECTION OF THE SCAFFOLD IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD
LJ008-0013 AS REGARDS THE FIRST I FIND THAT IN 1786
LJ008-0014 JOHN HOGAN THE MURDERER OF A MR. ODELL AN ATTORNEY WHO RESIDED IN CHARLOTTE STREET RATHBONE PLACE
LJ008-0015 WAS EXECUTED ON A GIBBET IN FRONT OF HIS VICTIM'S HOUSE
LJ008-0016 LAWRENCE JONES A BURGLAR WAS IN 1793 ORDERED FOR EXECUTION IN HATTON GARDEN NEAR THE HOUSE HE HAD ROBBED
LJ008-0017 AND WHEN HE EVADED THE SENTENCE BY SUICIDE HIS BODY WAS EXHIBITED IN THE SAME NEIGHBORHOOD
LJ008-0018 EXTENDED UPON A PLANK ON THE TOP OF AN OPEN CART IN HIS CLOTHES AND FETTERED
LJ008-0019 AGAIN AS LATE AS 1809 AND EIGHTEEN TWELVE EXECUTION DOCK ON THE BANKS OF THE THAMES WAS STILL RETAINED
LJ008-0020 HERE JOHN SUTHERLAND COMMANDER OF THE BRITISH ARMED TRANSPORT 'THE FRIENDS' SUFFERED ON THE 29TH JUNE 1809
LJ008-0021 FOR THE MURDER OF HIS CABINBOY WHOM HE STABBED AFTER MUCH ILLUSAGE ON BOARD THE SHIP AS IT LAY IN THE TAGUS
LJ008-0022 ON THE 18TH DECEMBER EIGHTEEN TWELVE
LJ008-0023 TWO SAILORS CHARLES PALM AND SAM TILLING WERE HANGED AT THE SAME PLACE FOR THE MURDER OF THEIR CAPTAIN JAMES KEITH
LJ008-0024 OF THE TRADING VESSEL ADVENTURE UPON THE HIGH SEAS
LJ008-0025 THEY WERE TAKEN IN A CART TO THE PLACE OF EXECUTION AMIDST A VAST CONCOURSE OF PEOPLE
LJ008-0026 PALM AS SOON AS HE WAS SEATED IN THE CART
LJ008-0027 PUT A QUID OF TOBACCO INTO HIS MOUTH AND OFFERED ANOTHER TO HIS COMPANION WHO REFUSED IT WITH INDIGNATION
LJ008-0028 SOME INDICATIONS OF PITY WERE OFFERED FOR THE FATE OF TILLING PALM EXECRATION ALONE
LJ008-0029 BUT THE OLD BAILEY GRADUALLY AND IN SPITE OF ALL OBJECTIONS URGED MONOPOLIZED THE DREAD BUSINESS OF EXECUTION
LJ008-0030 THE FIRST AFFAIR OF THE KIND ON THIS SPOT WAS ON THE 3RD DECEMBER SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE
LJ008-0031 WHEN IN PURSUANCE OF AN ORDER ISSUED BY THE RECORDER TO THE SHERIFFS OF MIDDLESEX AND THE KEEPER OF HIS MAJESTY'S JAIL NEWGATE
LJ008-0032 A SCAFFOLD WAS ERECTED IN FRONT OF THAT PRISON FOR THE EXECUTION OF SEVERAL CONVICTS NAMED BY THE RECORDER
LJ008-0033 TEN WERE EXECUTED
LJ008-0034 THE SCAFFOLD HUNG WITH BLACK AND THE INHABITANTS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD HAVING PETITIONED THE SHERIFFS TO REMOVE THE SCENE OF EXECUTION TO THE OLD PLACE
LJ008-0035 WERE TOLD THAT THE PLAN HAD BEEN WELL CONSIDERED AND WOULD BE PERSEVERED IN
LJ008-0036 THE FOLLOWING 23RD APRIL IT IS STATED THAT THE MALEFACTORS ORDERED FOR EXECUTION ON THE 18TH INSTEAD
LJ008-0037 WERE BROUGHT OUT OF NEWGATE ABOUT EIGHT IN THE MORNING AND SUSPENDED ON A GALLOWS OF A NEW CONSTRUCTION
LJ008-0038 AFTER HANGING THE USUAL TIME THEY WERE TAKEN DOWN AND THE MACHINE CLEARED AWAY IN HALFANHOUR
LJ008-0039 BY PRACTICE THE ART IS MUCH IMPROVED AND THERE IS NO PART OF THE WORLD IN WHICH VILLAINS ARE HANGED IN SO NEAT A MANNER AND WITH SO LITTLE CEREMONY
LJ008-0040 A FULL DESCRIPTION OF THIS NEW GALLOWS WHICH WAS ERECTED IN FRONT OF THE DEBTORS' DOOR IS TO BE FOUND IN CONTEMPORARY RECORDS
LJ008-0041 THE CRIMINALS ARE NOT EXPOSED TO VIEW TILL THEY MOUNT THE FATAL STAGE. THE LAST PART OF THE STAGE OR THAT NEXT TO THE JAIL
LJ008-0042 IS ENCLOSED BY A TEMPORARY ROOF UNDER WHICH ARE PLACED TWO SEATS FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE SHERIFFS ONE ON EACH SIDE OF THE STAIRS LEADING TO THE SCAFFOLD
LJ008-0043 ROUND THE NORTH WEST AND SOUTH SIDES ARE ERECTED GALLERIES FOR THE RECEPTION OF OFFICERS ATTENDANTS ETC
LJ008-0044 AND AT THE DISTANCE OF FIVE FEET FROM THE SAME IS FIXED A STRONG RAILING ALL ROUND THE SCAFFOLD TO ENCLOSE A PLACE FOR THE CONSTABLES
LJ008-0045 IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS MACHINERY IS PLACED A MOVABLE PLATFORM IN FORM OF A TRAPDOOR TEN FEET LONG BY EIGHT WIDE
LJ008-0046 ON THE MIDDLE OF WHICH IS PLACED THE GIBBET EXTENDING FROM THE JAIL ACROSS THE OLD BAILEY
LJ008-0047 THIS MOVABLE PLATFORM IS RAISED SIX INCHES HIGHER THAN THE REST OF THE SCAFFOLD AND ON IT THE CONVICTS STAND
LJ008-0048 IT IS SUPPORTED BY TWO BEAMS WHICH ARE HELD IN THEIR PLACE BY BOLTS. THE MOVEMENT OF THE LEVER WITHDRAWS THE BOLTS THE PLATFORM FALLS IN
LJ008-0049 AND THIS BEING MUCH MORE SUDDEN AND REGULAR THAN THAT OF A CART BEING DRAWN AWAY HAS THE EFFECT OF IMMEDIATE DEATH
LJ008-0050 A BROADSHEET DATED APRIL 24TH 1787 DESCRIBING AN EXECUTION ON THE NEWLYINVENTED SCAFFOLD BEFORE THE DEBTORS' DOOR
LJ008-0051 SAYS THE SCAFFOLD ON WHICH THESE MISERABLE PEOPLE SUFFERED IS A TEMPORARY MACHINE WHICH WAS DRAWN OUT OF THE YARD OF THE SESSIONS HOUSE BY HORSES
LJ008-0052 IT IS SUPPORTED BY STRONG POSTS FIXED INTO GROOVES MADE IN THE STREET
LJ008-0053 THE WHOLE IS TEMPORARY BEING ALL CALCULATED TO TAKE TO PIECES WHICH ARE PRESERVED WITHIN THE PRISON
LJ008-0054 THIS CONTRIVANCE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN COPIED WITH IMPROVEMENTS FROM THAT WHICH HAD BEEN USED IN DUBLIN AT A STILL EARLIER DATE
LJ008-0055 FOR THAT CITY CLAIMS THE PRIORITY IN ESTABLISHING THE CUSTOM OF HANGING CRIMINALS AT THE JAIL ITSELF
LJ008-0056 THE DUBLIN ENGINE OF DEATH AS THE GALLOWS ARE STYLED IN THE ACCOUNT FROM WHICH THE FOLLOWING DESCRIPTION IS TAKEN CONSISTED OF AN IRON BAR
LJ008-0057 PARALLEL TO THE PRISON WALL AND ABOUT FOUR FEET FROM IT BUT STRONGLY AFFIXED THERETO WITH IRON SCROLL CLAMPS
LJ008-0058 FROM THIS BAR HANG SEVERAL IRON LOOPS IN WHICH THE HALTERS ARE TIED
LJ008-0059 UNDER THIS BAR AT A PROPER DISTANCE IS A PIECE OF FLOORING OR PLATFORM
LJ008-0060 PROJECTING SOMEWHAT BEYOND THE RANGE OF THE IRON BAR AND SWINGING UPON HINGES AFFIXED TO THE WALL
LJ008-0061 THE ENTRANCE UPON THIS FLOOR OR LEAF IS FROM THE MIDDLE WINDOW OVER THE GATE OF THE PRISON
LJ008-0062 AND THIS FLOOR IS SUPPORTED BELOW
LJ008-0063 WHILE THE CRIMINALS STAND UPON IT BY TWO PIECES OF TIMBER WHICH ARE MADE TO SLIDE IN AND OUT OF THE PRISON WALL THROUGH APERTURES MADE FOR THAT PURPOSE
LJ008-0064 WHEN THE CRIMINALS ARE TIED UP AND PREPARED FOR THEIR FATE THIS FLOOR SUDDENLY FALLS DOWN UPON WITHDRAWING THE SUPPORTERS INWARDS
LJ008-0065 THEY ARE BOTH DRAWN AT ONCE BY A WINDLASS AND THE UNHAPPY CULPRITS REMAIN SUSPENDED
LJ008-0066 THIS MODE OF EXECUTION IT IS ALLEGED GAVE RISE TO THE OLD VULGAR CHAFF TAKE CARE OR YOU'LL DIE AT THE FALL OF THE LEAF
LJ008-0067 THE MACHINERY IN USE IN DUBLIN IS MUCH THE SAME AS THAT EMPLOYED AT MANY JAILS NOWADAYS
LJ008-0068 BUT THE FALL APART AND INWARDS OF TWO LEAVES IS CONSIDERED SUPERIOR
LJ008-0069 THE LATTER IS THE METHOD STILL FOLLOWED AT NEWGATE
LJ008-0070 THE SENTENCES INFLICTED IN FRONT OF NEWGATE WERE NOT LIMITED TO HANGING
LJ008-0071 IN THE FEW YEARS WHICH ELAPSED BETWEEN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE GALLOWS AT NEWGATE
LJ008-0072 AND THE ABOLITION OF THE PRACTICE OF BURNING FEMALES FOR PETTY TREASON MORE THAN ONE WOMAN SUFFERED THIS PENALTY AT THE OLD BAILEY
LJ008-0073 ONE CASE IS PRESERVED BY CATNACH
LJ008-0074 THAT OF PHOEBE HARRIS WHO IN 1788 WAS BARBARIOUSLY EXECUTED AND BURNT BEFORE NEWGATE FOR COINING
LJ008-0075 SHE IS DESCRIBED AS A WELLMADE LITTLE WOMAN SOMETHING MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS OF AGE OF A PALE COMPLEXION AND NOT DISAGREEABLE FEATURES
LJ008-0076 WHEN SHE CAME OUT OF PRISON SHE APPEARED LANGUID AND TERRIFIED AND TREMBLED GREATLY AS SHE ADVANCED TO THE STAKE
LJ008-0077 WHERE THE APPARATUS FOR THE PUNISHMENT SHE WAS ABOUT TO EXPERIENCE
LJ008-0078 SEEMED TO STRIKE HER MIND WITH HORROR AND CONSTERNATION TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL POWER OF RECOLLECTEDNESS IN PREPARATION FOR THE APPROACHING AWFUL MOMENT
LJ008-0079 SHE WALKED FROM THE DEBTORS' DOOR TO A STAKE FIXED IN THE GROUND ABOUT HALFWAY BETWEEN THE SCAFFOLD AND NEWGATE STREET
LJ008-0080 SHE WAS IMMEDIATELY TIED BY THE NECK TO AN IRON BOLT FIXED NEAR THE TOP OF THE STAKE
LJ008-0081 AND AFTER PRAYING FERVENTLY FOR A FEW MINUTES THE STEPS ON WHICH SHE STOOD WERE DRAWN AWAY AND SHE WAS LEFT SUSPENDED
LJ008-0082 A CHAIN FASTENED BY NAILS TO THE STAKE WAS THEN PUT ROUND HER BODY BY THE EXECUTIONER WITH HIS ASSISTANTS
LJ008-0083 TWO CARTLOADS OF FAGGOTS WERE PILED ABOUT HER AND AFTER SHE HAD HUNG FOR HALFANHOUR THE FIRE WAS KINDLED
LJ008-0084 THE FLAMES PRESENTLY BURNED THE HALTER THE BODY FELL A FEW INCHES AND HUNG THEN BY THE IRON CHAIN
LJ008-0085 THE FIRE HAD NOT QUITE BURNT OUT AT TWELVE IN NEARLY FOUR HOURS THAT IS TO SAY
LJ008-0086 A GREAT CONCOURSE OF PEOPLE ATTENDED ON THIS MELANCHOLY OCCASION
LJ008-0087 THE CHANGE FROM TYBURN TO THE OLD BAILEY HAD WORKED NO IMPROVEMENT AS REGARDS THE GATHERING TOGETHER OF THE CROWD OR ITS DEMEANOR
LJ008-0088 AS MANY SPECTATORS AS EVER THRONGED TO SEE THE DREADFUL SHOW
LJ008-0089 AND THEY WERE PACKED INTO A MORE LIMITED SPACE DISPORTING THEMSELVES AS HERETOFORE BY BRUTAL HORSEPLAY COARSE JESTS AND FRANTIC YELLS
LJ008-0090 IT WAS STILL THE CUSTOM TO OFFER WARM ENCOURAGEMENT OR BITTER DISAPPROVAL ACCORDING TO THE CHARACTER AND ANTECEDENTS OF THE SUFFERER
LJ008-0091 THE HIGHWAYMAN WHOSE EXPLOITS MANY IN THE CROWD ADMIRED OR EMULATED WAS CHEERED AND BIDDEN TO DIE GAME
LJ008-0092 THE MAN OF BETTER BIRTH COULD HOPE FOR NO SYMPATHY WHATEVER HIS CRIME
LJ008-0093 AT THE EXECUTION OF GOVERNOR WALL IN 1802 THE FURIOUS HATRED OF THE MOB WAS PLAINLY APPARENT IN THEIR APPALLING CRIES
LJ008-0094 HIS APPEARANCE ON THE SCAFFOLD WAS THE SIGNAL FOR THREE PROLONGED SHOUTS FROM AN INNUMERABLE POPULACE THE BRUTAL EFFUSION OF ONE COMMON SENTIMENT
LJ008-0095 IT WAS SAID THAT SO LARGE A CROWD HAD NEVER COLLECTED SINCE THE EXECUTION OF MRS. BROWNRIGG NOR HAD THE PUBLIC INDIGNATION RISEN SO HIGH
LJ008-0096 PIEMAN AND BALLADMONGER DID THEIR USUAL ROARING TRADE AMIDST THE DENSE THRONG
LJ008-0097 NO SOONER WAS THE JOB FINISHED THAN HALFADOZEN COMPETITORS APPEARED EACH OFFERING THE IDENTICAL ROPE FOR SALE AT A SHILLING AN INCH
LJ008-0098 ONE WAS THE YEOMAN OF THE HALTER A NEWGATE OFFICIAL THE EXECUTIONER'S ASSISTANT WHOM MR. J. T. SMITH WHO WAS PRESENT AT THE EXECUTION
LJ008-0099 DESCRIBES AS A MOST DIABOLICALLOOKING LITTLE WRETCH  JACK KETCH'S HEAD MAN
LJ008-0100 THE YEOMAN WAS HOWEVER UNDERSOLD BY HIS WIFE ROSY EMMA
LJ008-0101 EXUBERANT IN TALK AND HISSING HOT FROM PIE CORNER WHERE SHE HAD TAKEN HER MORNING DOSE OF GINANDBITTERS
LJ008-0102 A LITTLE FURTHER OFF SAYS MR. SMITH WAS A LATH OF A FELLOW PAST THREESCORE YEARS AND TEN
LJ008-0103 WHO HAD JUST ARRIVED FROM THE PURLIEUS OF BLACK BOY ALLEY WOEBEGONE AS ROMEO'S APOTHECARY EXCLAIMING
LJ008-0104 HERE'S THE IDENTICAL ROPE AT SIXPENCE AN INCH
LJ008-0105 MR. SMITH'S ACCOUNT OF THE CONDEMNED CONVICT WHOSE CELL HE WAS PERMITTED TO ENTER MAY BE INSERTED HERE
LJ008-0106 HE WAS INTRODUCED BY THE ORDINARY DR. FORDE A NAME FAMILIAR TO THE READER WHO MET HIM AT THE FELONS' DOOR
LJ008-0107 IN HIS CANONICALS AND WITH HIS HEAD AS STIFFLY ERECT AS A SHERIFF'S COACHMAN
LJ008-0108 THE ORDINARY GRAVELY UTTERED COME THIS WAY MR. SMITH
LJ008-0109 AS WE CROSSED THE PRESS YARD A COCK CREW AND THE SOLITARY CLANKING OF A RESTLESS CHAIN WAS DREADFULLY HORRIBLE
LJ008-0110 THE PRISONERS HAD NOT RISEN
LJ008-0111 THEY ENTERED A STONE COLD ROOM AND WERE PRESENTLY JOINED BY THE PRISONER
LJ008-0112 HE WAS DEATH'S COUNTERFEIT TALL SHRIVELED AND PALE
LJ008-0113 AND HIS SOUL SHOT OUT SO PIERCINGLY THROUGH THE PORTHOLES OF HIS HEAD THAT THE FIRST GLANCE OF HIM NEARLY PETRIFIED ME
LJ008-0114 HIS HANDS WERE CLASPED AND HE WAS TRULY PENITENT
LJ008-0115 AFTER THE YEOMAN HAD REQUESTED HIM TO STAND UP 'HE PINIONED HIM' AS THE NEWGATE PHRASE IS
LJ008-0116 AND TIED THE CORD WITH SO LITTLE FEELING THAT THE GOVERNOR WALL WHO HAD NOT GIVEN THE WRETCH HIS ACCUSTOMED FEE OBSERVED
LJ008-0117 YOU HAVE TIED ME VERY TIGHT UPON WHICH DR. FORDE ORDERED HIM TO SLACKEN THE CORD WHICH HE DID BUT NOT WITHOUT MUTTERING
LJ008-0118 THANK YOU SIR SAID THE GOVERNOR TO THE DOCTOR IT IS OF LITTLE MOMENT
LJ008-0119 HE THEN MADE SOME OBSERVATIONS TO THE ATTENDANT ABOUT THE FIRE AND TURNING TO THE DOCTOR QUESTIONED HIM
LJ008-0120 DO TELL ME SIR I AM INFORMED I SHALL GO DOWN WITH GREAT FORCE IS IT SO
LJ008-0121 AFTER THE CONSTRUCTION AND ACTION OF THE MACHINE HAD BEEN EXPLAINED THE DOCTOR ASKED THE GOVERNOR WHAT KIND OF MEN HE HAD COMMANDED AT GOREE
LJ008-0122 WHERE THE MURDER FOR WHICH HE WAS CONDEMNED HAD BEEN COMMITTED
LJ008-0123 SIR HE ANSWERED THEY SENT ME THE VERY RIFFRAFF
LJ008-0124 THE POOR SOUL THEN JOINED THE DOCTOR IN PRAYER AND NEVER DID I WITNESS MORE CONTRITION AT ANY CONDEMNED SERMON THAN HE THEN EVINCED
LJ008-0125 THE SHERIFF ARRIVED ATTENDED BY HIS OFFICERS TO RECEIVE THE PRISONER FROM THE KEEPER
LJ008-0126 A NEW HAT WAS PARTLY FLATTENED ON HIS HEAD FOR OWING TO ITS BEING TOO SMALL IN THE CROWN IT STOOD MANY INCHES TOO HIGH BEHIND
LJ008-0127 AS WE WERE CROSSING THE PRESS YARD
LJ008-0128 THE DREADFUL EXECRATIONS OF SOME OF THE FELONS SO SHOOK HIS FRAME THAT HE OBSERVED THE CLOCK HAD STRUCK AND QUICKENING HIS PACE
LJ008-0129 HE SOON ARRIVED AT THE ROOM WHERE THE SHERIFF WAS TO GIVE A RECEIPT FOR HIS BODY ACCORDING TO THE USUAL CUSTOM
LJ008-0130 BEFORE THE COLONEL HAD BEEN PINIONED HE HAD PULLED OUT TWO WHITE HANDKERCHIEFS ONE OF WHICH HE BOUND OVER HIS TEMPLES SO AS NEARLY TO CONCEAL HIS EYES
LJ008-0131 THE OTHER HE KEPT BETWEEN HIS HANDS
LJ008-0132 OVER THE HANDKERCHIEF AROUND HIS BROWS HE PLACED A WHITE CAP THE NEW HAT BEING ON TOP OF ALL
LJ008-0133 HE WAS DRESSED IN A MIXEDCOLORED LOOSE COAT WITH A BLACK COLLAR SWANDOWN WAISTCOAT BLUE PANTALOONS AND WHITE SILK STOCKINGS
LJ008-0134 THUS APPARELED HE ASCENDED THE STAIRS AT THE DEBTORS' DOOR
LJ008-0135 AND STEPPED OUT ON TO THE PLATFORM TO BE RECEIVED AS HAS BEEN SAID BY PROLONGED YELLS
LJ008-0136 THESE EVIDENTLY DEPRIVED HIM OF THE SMALL PORTION OF FORTITUDE HE HAD SUMMONED UP
LJ008-0137 HE BOWED HIS HEAD UNDER EXTREME PRESSURE OF IGNOMINY
LJ008-0138 AND AT HIS REQUEST THE ORDINARY DREW THE CAP FURTHER DOWN OVER HIS FACE WHEN IN AN INSTANT
LJ008-0139 WITHOUT WAITING FOR ANY SIGNAL THE PLATFORM DROPPED AND HE WAS LAUNCHED INTO ETERNITY
LJ008-0140 WHENEVER THE PUBLIC ATTENTION HAD BEEN SPECIALLY CALLED TO A PARTICULAR CRIME EITHER ON ACCOUNT OF ITS ATROCITY
LJ008-0141 THE DOUBTFULNESS OF THE ISSUE OR THE SUPERIOR POSITION OF THE PERPETRATOR
LJ008-0142 THE ATTENDANCE AT THE EXECUTION WAS CERTAIN TO BE TUMULTUOUS AND THE CONDUCT OF THE MOB DISORDERLY
LJ008-0143 THIS WAS NOTABLY THE CASE AT THE EXECUTION OF HOLLOWAY AND HAGGERTY
LJ008-0144 IN 1807 AN EVENT LONG REMEMBERED FROM THE FATAL AND DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES WHICH FOLLOWED IT
LJ008-0145 THEY WERE ACCUSED BY A CONFEDERATE WHO GOADED BY CONSCIENCE HAD TURNED APPROVER OF THE MURDER OF A MR. STEELE
LJ008-0146 WHO KEPT A LAVENDER WAREHOUSE IN THE CITY AND WHO HAD GARDENS AT FELTHAM
LJ008-0147 WHITHER HE OFTEN WENT TO DISTILL THE LAVENDER RETURNING TO LONDON THE SAME EVENING
LJ008-0148 ONE NIGHT HE WAS MISSING
LJ008-0149 AND AFTER A LONG INTERVAL HIS DEAD BODY WAS DISCOVERED SHOCKINGLY DISFIGURED IN A DITCH. THIS WAS IN 1802
LJ008-0150 FOUR YEARS PASSED WITHOUT THE DETECTION OF THE MURDERERS
LJ008-0151 BUT IN THE BEGINNING OF 1807 ONE OF THEM AT THAT TIME JUST SENTENCED TO TRANSPORTATION
LJ008-0152 MADE A FULL CONFESSION AND IMPLICATED HOLLOWAY AND HAGGERTY
LJ008-0153 THEY WERE ACCORDINGLY APPREHENDED AND BROUGHT TO TRIAL THE INFORMER HANFIELD BY NAME BEING ACCEPTED AS KING'S EVIDENCE
LJ008-0154 CONVICTION FOLLOWED MAINLY ON HIS TESTIMONY BUT THE TWO MEN ESPECIALLY HOLLOWAY STOUTLY MAINTAINED THEIR INNOCENCE TO THE LAST
LJ008-0155 VERY GREAT EXCITEMENT PREVAILED IN THE TOWN THROUGHOUT THE TRIAL AND THIS GREATLY INCREASED WHEN THE VERDICT WAS KNOWN
LJ008-0156 AN ENORMOUS CROWD ASSEMBLED TO WITNESS THE EXECUTION AMOUNTING IT WAS SAID TO THE HITHERTO UNPARALLELED NUMBER OF 40000
LJ008-0157 BY EIGHT O'CLOCK NOT AN INCH OF GROUND IN FRONT OF THE PLATFORM WAS UNOCCUPIED
LJ008-0158 THE PRESSURE SOON BECAME SO FRIGHTFUL THAT MANY WOULD HAVE WILLINGLY ESCAPED FROM THE CROWD BUT THEIR ATTEMPTS ONLY INCREASED THE GENERAL CONFUSION
LJ008-0159 VERY SOON WOMEN BEGAN TO SCREAM WITH TERROR
LJ008-0160 SOME ESPECIALLY OF LOW STATURE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO REMAIN STANDING AND SEVERAL ALTHOUGH HELD UP FOR SOME TIME BY THE MEN NEAREST THEM
LJ008-0161 PRESENTLY FELL AND WERE AT ONCE TRAMPLED TO DEATH
LJ008-0162 CRIES OF MURDER MURDER WERE NOW RAISED AND ADDED GREATLY TO THE HORRORS OF THE SCENE
LJ008-0163 PANIC BECAME GENERAL MORE WOMEN CHILDREN AND MANY MEN WERE BORNE DOWN TO PERISH BENEATH THE FEET OF THE REST
LJ008-0164 THE MOST AFFECTING AND DISTRESSING SCENE WAS AT GREEN ARBOR LANE JUST OPPOSITE THE DEBTORS' DOOR OF THE PRISON
LJ008-0165 HERE A COUPLE OF PIEMEN HAD BEEN SELLING THEIR WARES THE BASKET OF ONE OF THEM WHICH WAS RAISED UPON A FOURLEGGED STOOL WAS UPSET
LJ008-0166 THE PIEMAN STOOPED DOWN TO PICK UP HIS SCATTERED STOCK AND SOME OF THE MOB NOT SEEING WHAT HAD HAPPENED STUMBLED OVER HIM
LJ008-0167 NO ONE WHO FELL EVER ROSE AGAIN
LJ008-0168 AMONG THE REST WAS A WOMAN WITH AN INFANT AT THE BREAST
LJ008-0169 SHE WAS KILLED BUT IN THE ACT OF FALLING SHE FORCED HER CHILD INTO THE ARMS OF A MAN NEAR HER AND IMPLORED HIM IN GOD'S NAME TO SAVE IT
LJ008-0170 THE MAN NEEDING ALL HIS CARE FOR HIS OWN LIFE THREW THE CHILD FROM HIM
LJ008-0171 AND IT PASSED ALONG THE HEADS OF THE CROWD TO BE CAUGHT AT LAST BY A PERSON WHO STRUGGLED WITH IT TO A CART AND DEPOSITED IT THERE IN SAFETY
LJ008-0172 IN ANOTHER PART SEVEN PERSONS MET THEIR DEATH BY SUFFOCATION
LJ008-0173 IN THIS CONVULSIVE STRUGGLE FOR BARE EXISTENCE PEOPLE FOUGHT FIERCELY WITH ONE ANOTHER AND THE WEAKEST OF COURSE THE WOMEN WENT UNDER
LJ008-0174 ONE CARTLOAD OF SPECTATORS HAVING BROKEN DOWN SOME OF ITS OCCUPANTS FELL OFF THE VEHICLE AND WERE INSTANTLY TRAMPLED TO DEATH
LJ008-0175 THIS WENT ON FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR AND UNTIL THE MALEFACTORS WERE CUT DOWN AND THE GALLOWS REMOVED
LJ008-0176 THEN THE MOB BEGAN TO THIN AND THE STREETS WERE CLEARED BY THE CITY MARSHALS AND A NUMBER OF CONSTABLES
LJ008-0177 THE CATASTROPHE EXCEEDED THE WORST ANTICIPATIONS NEARLY ONE HUNDRED DEAD AND DYING LAY ABOUT AND AFTER ALL HAD BEEN REMOVED
LJ008-0178 THE BODIES FOR IDENTIFICATION THE WOUNDED TO HOSPITALS A CARTLOAD OF SHOES HATS PETTICOATS AND FRAGMENTS OF WEARING APPAREL WERE PICKED UP
LJ008-0180 AMONG THE DEAD WAS A SAILOR LAD WHOM NO ONE KNEW
LJ008-0181 HE HAD HIS POCKETS FILLED WITH BREAD AND CHEESE AND IT WAS GENERALLY SUPPOSED THAT HE HAD COME A LONG DISTANCE TO SEE THE FATAL SHOW
LJ008-0182 A TREMENDOUS CROWD ASSEMBLED WHEN BELLINGHAM WAS EXECUTED IN EIGHTEEN TWELVE FOR THE MURDER OF SPENCER PERCIVAL AT THAT TIME PRIME MINISTER
LJ008-0183 BUT THERE WERE NO SERIOUS ACCIDENTS BEYOND THOSE CAUSED BY THE GORING OF A MADDENED OVERDRIVEN OX WHICH FORCED ITS WAY THROUGH THE CROWD
LJ008-0184 PRECAUTIONS HAD BEEN TAKEN BY THE ERECTION OF BARRIERS AND THE POSTING OF PLACARDS AT ALL THE AVENUES TO THE OLD BAILEY ON WHICH WAS PRINTED
LJ008-0185 BEWARE OF ENTERING THE CROWD REMEMBER THIRTY POOR PERSONS WERE PRESSED TO DEATH BY THE CROWD WHEN HAGGERTY AND HOLLOWAY WERE EXECUTED
LJ008-0186 THE CONCOURSE WAS VERY GREAT NOTWITHSTANDING THESE WARNINGS
LJ008-0187 IT WAS STILL GREATER AT FAUNTLEROY'S EXECUTION IN 1824 WHEN NO LESS THAN 100000 PERSONS ASSEMBLED IT WAS SAID
LJ008-0188 EVERY WINDOW AND ROOF WHICH COULD COMMAND A VIEW OF THE HORRIBLE PERFORMANCE WAS OCCUPIED
LJ008-0189 ALL THE AVENUES AND APPROACHES PLACES EVEN WHENCE NOTHING WHATEVER COULD BE SEEN OF THE SCAFFOLD
LJ008-0190 WERE BLOCKED BY PERSONS WHO HAD OVERFLOWED FROM THE AREA IN FRONT OF THE JAIL
LJ008-0191 AT COURVOISIER'S EXECUTION IN EIGHTEEN FOURTY IT WAS THE SAME OR WORSE
LJ008-0192 AS EARLY AS SIX A.M. THE NUMBER ASSEMBLED ALREADY EXCEEDED THAT SEEN ON ORDINARY OCCASIONS
LJ008-0193 BY SEVEN A.M. THE WHOLE SPACE WAS SO THRONGED THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO MOVE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER
LJ008-0194 SOME PERSONS WERE KEPT FOR MORE THAN FIVE HOURS STANDING AGAINST THE BARRIERS AND MANY NEARLY FAINTED FROM EXHAUSTION
LJ008-0195 EVERY WINDOW HAD ITS PARTY OF OCCUPANTS THE ADJOINING ROOFS WERE EQUALLY CROWDED
LJ008-0196 HIGH PRICES WERE ASKED AND PAID FOR FRONT SEATS OR GOOD STANDING ROOM AS MUCH AS £5 WAS GIVEN FOR THE ATTIC STORY
LJ008-0197 OF THE LAMB'S COFFEE HOUSE
LJ008-0198 TWO POUNDS WAS A COMMON PRICE FOR A WINDOW
LJ008-0199 AT THE GEORGE PUBLICHOUSE TO THE SOUTH OF THE DROP SIR W. WATKIN WYNN BARONET
LJ008-0200 HIRED A ROOM FOR THE NIGHT AND MORNING WHICH HE AND A LARGE PARTY OF FRIENDS OCCUPIED BEFORE AND DURING THE EXECUTION
LJ008-0201 IN AN ADJOINING HOUSE THAT OF AN UNDERTAKER WAS LORD ALFRED PAGET ALSO WITH SEVERAL FRIENDS
LJ008-0202 THOSE WHO HAD HIRED APARTMENTS SPENT THE NIGHT IN THEM KEEPING UP THEIR COURAGE WITH LIQUIDS AND CIGARS
LJ008-0203 NUMBERS OF LADIES WERE PRESENT ALTHOUGH THE PUBLIC FEELING WAS MUCH AGAINST THEIR ATTENDANCE
LJ008-0204 ONE WELLDRESSED WOMAN FELL OUT OF A FIRSTFLOOR WINDOW ON TO THE SHOULDERS OF THE CROWD BELOW BUT NEITHER SHE NOR ANY ONE ELSE WAS GREATLY HURT
LJ008-0205 THE CITY AUTHORITIES HAD ENDEAVORED TO TAKE ALL PRECAUTIONS AGAINST PANIC AND EXCITEMENT AMONG THE CROWD
LJ008-0206 AND CAUSED A NUMBER OF STOUT ADDITIONAL BARRIERS TO BE ERECTED IN FRONT OF THE SCAFFOLD
LJ008-0207 AND ALTHOUGH ONE OF THESE GAVE WAY OWING TO THE EXTRAORDINARY PRESSURE NO SERIOUS ACCIDENT OCCURRED
LJ008-0208 SOME YEARS LATER AN EYEWITNESS PUBLISHED A GRAPHIC ACCOUNT OF ONE OF THESE SCENES
LJ008-0209 SOON AFTER MIDNIGHT ON THE SUNDAY NIGHT FOR BY THIS TIME THE PRESENT PRACTICE OF EXECUTING ON MONDAY MORNING HAD BEEN PRETTY GENERALLY INTRODUCED
LJ008-0210 THE CROWD BEGAN TO CONGREGATE IN AND ABOUT THE OLD BAILEY
LJ008-0211 GINSHOPS AND COFFEEHOUSES WERE THE FIRST TO OPEN DOORS AND TOUTS BEGAN TO BID FOR TENANTS FOR THE VARIOUS ROOMS UPSTAIRS
LJ008-0212 CRIES OF COMFORTABLE ROOM EXCELLENT SITUATION BEAUTIFUL PROSPECT SPLENDID VIEW RESOUNDED ON EVERY SIDE
LJ008-0213 BY THIS TIME THE WORKMEN MIGHT BE HEARD BUSILY ERECTING THE GALLOWS
LJ008-0214 THE SOUNDS OF HAMMER AND SAW INTERMINGLED WITH THE BROAD JEERS AND COARSE JESTS OF THE RAPIDLY INCREASING MOB
LJ008-0215 ONE BY ONE THE HUGE UPRIGHTS OF BLACK TIMBER WERE FITTED TOGETHER
LJ008-0216 UNTIL PRESENTLY THE HUGE STAGE LOOMED DARK ABOVE THE CROWD WHICH WAS NOW RANGED ROUND THE BARRIERS
LJ008-0217 A THRONG OF PEOPLE WHOM NEITHER RAIN SNOW STORM NOR DARKNESS EVER HINDERED FROM ATTENDING THE SHOW
LJ008-0218 THEY WERE MAINLY MEMBERS OF THE CRIMINAL CLASSES
LJ008-0219 THEIR CONVERSATION WAS OF COMPANIONS AND ASSOCIATES OF FORMER YEARS LONG AGO IMPRISONED TRANSPORTED HANGED WHILE THEY
LJ008-0220 HOARYHEADED AND HARDENED IN GUILT WERE STILL AT LARGE
LJ008-0221 THEY TALKED OF THE DAYS WHEN THE CONVICTS WERE HUNG UP A DOZEN OR MORE IN A ROW
LJ008-0222 OF THOSE WHO HAD SHOWN THE WHITE AND THOSE WHO HAD DIED GAME
LJ008-0223 THE APPROACHING CEREMONY HAD EVIDENTLY NO TERRORS FOR THESE IDOLATERS OF THE GALLOWS
LJ008-0224 WITH THEM WERE YOUNGER MEN AND WOMEN
LJ008-0225 THE FORMER ALREADY VOWED TO THE SAME CRIMINAL CAREER AND LOOKING UP TO THEIR ELDERS WITH THE RESPECT DUE TO SUCCESSFUL PRACTITIONERS
LJ008-0226 THE LATTER UNSEXED AND BRUTALIZED BY DISSIPATION
LJ008-0227 SLIPSHOD AND SLOVENLY IN CRUSHED BONNET AND DIRTY SHAWL THE GOWN FASTENED BY A SINGLE HOOK
LJ008-0228 THEIR HARSH AND HALFCRACKED VOICES FULL OF MAUDLIN BESOTTED SYMPATHY FOR THOSE ABOUT TO DIE
LJ008-0229 ABOVE THE MURMUR AND TUMULT OF THAT NOISY ASSEMBLY THE LOWING AND BLEATING OF CATTLE AS THEY WERE DRIVEN INTO THE STALLS AND PENS OF SMITHFIELD
LJ008-0230 FELL WITH A STRANGE UNNATURAL SOUND UPON THE EAR
LJ008-0231 HUSH THE UNCEASING MURMUR OF THE MOB NOW BREAKS INTO A LOUD DEEP ROAR
LJ008-0232 A SOUND AS IF THE OCEAN HAD SUDDENLY BROKEN THROUGH SOME ANCIENT BOUNDARY AGAINST WHICH ITS EVER RESTLESS BILLOWS HAD FOR AGES BATTERED
LJ008-0233 THE WIDE DARK SEA OF HEADS IS ALL AT ONCE IN MOTION
LJ008-0234 EACH WAVE SEEMS TRYING TO OVERLEAP THE OTHER AS THEY ARE DRAWN ONWARDS TOWARDS THIS OUTLET
LJ008-0235 EVERY LINK IN THAT GREAT HUMAN CHAIN IS SHAKEN ALONG THE WHOLE LENGTHENED LINE HAS THE MOTION JARRED AND EACH IN TURN SEES
LJ008-0236 COILED UP ON THE FLOOR OF THE SCAFFOLD LIKE A SERPENT THE HANGMAN'S ROPE
LJ008-0237 THE HUMAN HAND THAT PLACED IT THERE WAS ONLY SEEN FOR A MOMENT
LJ008-0238 AS IT LAY WHITE AND GHASTLY UPON THE BLACK BOARDS AND THEN AGAIN WAS AS SUDDENLY WITHDRAWN AS IF ASHAMED OF THE DEED IT HAD DONE
LJ008-0239 THE LOUD SHOUT OF THE MULTITUDE ONCE MORE SUBSIDED OR ONLY FELL UPON THE ABSTRACTED EAR LIKE THE DREAMY MURMUR OF AN OCEAN SHELL
LJ008-0240 THEN FOLLOWED SOUNDS MORE DISTINCT AND AUDIBLE IN WHICH GINGERBEER PIES FRIED FISH SANDWICHES AND FRUIT
LJ008-0241 WERE VENDED UNDER THE NAMES OF NOTORIOUS MURDERERS HIGHWAYMEN AND CRIMINALS
LJ008-0242 FAMOUS IN THE ANNALS OF NEWGATE FOR THE HARDIHOOD THEY HAD DISPLAYED IN THE HOUR OF EXECUTION WHEN THEY TERMINATED THEIR CAREER OF CRIME AT THE GALLOWS
LJ008-0243 THREADING HIS WAY AMONG THESE ITINERANT VENDORS WAS SEEN THE MEEKFACED DELIVERER OF TRACTS THE MAN OF GOOD INTENTIONS NOW BONNETED
LJ008-0244 NOW LAUGHED AT THE SKIRT OF HIS SEEDY BLACK COAT TORN ACROSS YET
LJ008-0245 THOUGH PULLED RIGHT AND LEFT OR SENT HEADLONG INTO THE CROWD BY THE SWING OF SOME BRUTAL AND MUSCULAR ARM
LJ008-0246 NEVER ONCE FROM THAT PALE FACE PASSED AWAY ITS BENIGN AND PATIENT EXPRESSION
LJ008-0247 BUT EVER THE SAME FORM MOVED ALONG IN THE FULFILLMENT OF HIS MISSION IN SPITE OF ALL PERSECUTION
LJ008-0248 ANOTHER FIGHT FOLLOWED THE SCORE WHICH HAD ALREADY TAKEN PLACE THIS TIME TWO WOMEN WERE THE COMBATANTS
LJ008-0249 BLINDED WITH THEIR LONG HAIR THEY TORE AT EACH OTHER LIKE TWO FURIES THEIR BONNETS AND CAPS WERE TRODDEN UNDERFOOT IN THE KENNEL
LJ008-0250 AND LAY DISREGARDED BESIDE THE BODY OF THE POOR DOG WHICH WHILE SEARCHING FOR ITS MASTER IN THE CROWD
LJ008-0251 WAS AN HOUR BEFORE KICKED TO DEATH BY THE SAVAGE AND BRUTAL MOB
LJ008-0252 ANOTHER DEEP ROAR LOUDER THAN ANY WHICH HAD PRECEDED IT BROKE FROM THE MULTITUDE
LJ008-0253 THEN CAME THE CRY OF 'HATS OFF' AND 'DOWN IN FRONT' AS AT A THEATRE
LJ008-0254 IT WAS FOLLOWED BY THE DEEP AND SOLEMN BOOMING OF THE DEATHBELL FROM THE CHURCH OF ST. SEPULCHRE
LJ008-0255 THE IRON KNELL THAT RANG UPON THE BEATING HEART OF THE LIVING MAN WHO WAS ABOUT TO DIE
LJ008-0256 AND WITH BLANCHED CHEEK AND SINKING WE TURNED AWAY FROM THE SCENE
LJ008-0257 IN THUS DESCRIBING THE SATURNALIA BEFORE THE GALLOWS I HAVE BEEN DRAWN ON SOMEWHAT BEYOND THE PERIOD WITH WHICH I AM AT PRESENT DEALING
LJ008-0258 LET ME RETRACE MY STEPS AND SPEAK MORE IN DETAIL OF THE TREATMENT OF THE CONDEMNED IN THOSE BLOODTHIRSTY AND BRUTALLY INDIFFERENT DAYS
LJ008-0259 AND OF THEIR DEMEANOR AFTER SENTENCE UNTIL THE LAST PENALTY WAS PAID
LJ008-0260 ONE OF THE WORST EVILS WAS THE TERRIBLE AND LONGPROTRACTED UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE RESULT
LJ008-0261 IN THE CASE OF CONVICTED MURDERERS ONLY WAS PROMPT PUNISHMENT INFLICTED
LJ008-0262 AND WITH THEM INDEED THIS DISPATCH AMOUNTED TO UNDUE PRECIPITANCY
LJ008-0263 FORTYEIGHT HOURS WAS THE LIMIT OF TIME ALLOWED TO THE UNHAPPY MAN TO MAKE HIS PEACE AND DURING THAT TIME HE WAS STILL KEPT ON A BARE ALLOWANCE OF BREAD AND WATER
LJ008-0264 BUT THE MURDERERS FORMED ONLY A SMALL PROPORTION OF THE TOTAL NUMBER SENTENCED TO DEATH AND FOR THE REST THERE WAS A LONG PERIOD OF ANXIOUS SUSPENSE
LJ008-0265 ALTHOUGH IN THE LONG RUN MERCY GENERALLY PREVAILED AND VERY FEW CAPITALLY CONVICTED FOR CRIMES LESS THAN MURDER ACTUALLY SUFFERED
LJ008-0266 THUS IN THE YEARS BETWEEN MAY 1ST 1827 AND 30TH APRIL EIGHTEEN THIRTY ONE
LJ008-0267 NO LESS THAN FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTYONE SENTENCES OF DEATH FOR CAPITAL CRIMES WERE PASSED AT THE OLD BAILEY
LJ008-0268 BUT OF THESE THREE HUNDRED AND NINETYSIX WERE REVERSED BY THE KING IN COUNCIL AND ONLY FIFTYTWO WERE REALLY EXECUTED
LJ008-0269 ALREADY THE SEVERITY OF OUR CRIMINAL CODE AND THE NUMBER OF CAPITAL FELONIES UPON THE STATUTE BOOK HAD BROUGHT A REACTION
LJ008-0270 AND WHILE THE COURTS ADHERED TO THE LETTER OF THE LAW APPEALS WERE CONSTANTLY MADE TO THE ROYAL PREROGATIVE OF MERCY
LJ008-0271 THIS WAS MORE PARTICULARLY THE PRACTICE IN LONDON
LJ008-0272 JUDGES ON ASSIZE WERE SATISFIED WITH SIMPLY RECORDING A SENTENCE OF DEATH AGAINST OFFENDERS WHOM THEY DID NOT THINK DESERVED THE EXTREME PENALTY
LJ008-0273 AT THE OLD BAILEY ALMOST EVERY ONE CAPITALLY CONVICTED BY A JURY WAS SENTENCED TO BE HANGED
LJ008-0274 THE RESULT IN THE LATTER CASE WAS LEFT IN THE FIRST PLACE TO THE KING IN COUNCIL
LJ008-0275 BUT THERE WAS A FURTHER APPEAL THEN AS NOW TO THE KING HIMSELF OR PRACTICALLY TO THE HOME SECRETARY
LJ008-0276 NEITHER IN TOWN OR COUNTRY WERE CASES ENTIRELY TAKEN ON THEIR OWN MERITS
LJ008-0277 CONVICTED OFFENDERS MIGHT HAVE GOOD OR BAD LUCK THEY MIGHT BE ARRAIGNED WHEN THEIR PARTICULAR CRIME WAS UNCOMMON AND WERE THEN NEARLY CERTAIN TO ESCAPE
LJ008-0278 OR THEIRS MIGHT BE ONE OF MANY AND IT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED NECESSARY TO MAKE AN EXAMPLE
LJ008-0279 IN THIS LATTER IT MIGHT FAIRLY BE SAID THAT A MAN WAS PUT TO DEATH LESS FOR HIS OWN SINS THAN FOR THE CRIMES OF OTHERS
LJ008-0280 THE ABSURDITY OF THE SYSTEM ITS IRREGULARITY AND CRUELTY WERE FULLY TOUCHED UPON BY THE INSPECTORS OF PRISONS IN THEIR FIRST REPORT
LJ008-0281 THEY FOUND AT NEWGATE UNDER DISGRACEFUL CONDITIONS AS ALREADY DESCRIBED
LJ008-0282 SEVENTEEN CAPITAL CONVICTS UPON ALL OF WHOM THE SENTENCE OF DEATH HAD BEEN PASSED. EVENTUALLY TWO ONLY OF THE WHOLE NUMBER SUFFERED
LJ008-0283 TWO OTHERS WERE SENTENCED TO THREE MONTHS' IMPRISONMENT AND THE BALANCE TO VARYING TERMS
LJ008-0284 NOTHING COULD BE MORE STRONGLY MARKED THAN THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE ULTIMATE DESTINY OF DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS ALL ABIDING THE SAME AWFUL DOOM
LJ008-0285 ON THE ONE HAND THE GALLOWS ON THE OTHER A SHORT IMPRISONMENT
LJ008-0286 THE INSPECTORS VERY PROPERLY DESIRED TO CALL ATTENTION TO THE INEVITABLE TENDENCY IN THIS MODE OF DEALING WITH THE MOST AWFUL SANCTIONS OF THE LAW
LJ008-0287 TO MAKE THOSE SANCTIONS AN OBJECT OF CONTEMPTUOUS MOCKERY
LJ008-0288 THE CONSEQUENCES WERE PLAINLY PROVED TO THE INSPECTORS
LJ008-0289 CAPITALLY CONVICTED PRISONERS DID AS A MATTER OF FACT TREAT WITH HABITUAL AND INEXPRESSIBLE LEVITY THE SENTENCE OF DEATH
LJ008-0290 OF THIS I HAVE TREATED AT LENGTH IN THE LAST CHAPTER
LJ008-0291 THE TIME THUS SPENT VARIED CONSIDERABLY
LJ008-0292 BUT IT WAS SELDOM LESS THAN SIX WEEKS IT ALL DEPENDED UPON THE SOVEREIGN'S DISPOSITION TO DO BUSINESS
LJ008-0293 SOMETIMES THE PRIVY COUNCIL DID NOT MEET FOR MONTHS AND DURING ALL THAT TIME THE CONVICTS LANGUISHED WITH HOPE
LJ008-0294 NEARLY INDEFINITELY DEFERRED
LJ008-0295 WHEN THE COUNCIL HAD DECIDED THE NEWS WAS CONVEYED TO NEWGATE BY THE RECORDER WHO MADE HIS REPORT AS IT WAS CALLED
LJ008-0296 THE TIME OF THE ARRIVAL OF THIS REPORT WAS GENERALLY KNOWN AT NEWGATE
LJ008-0297 AND ITS CONTENTS WERE ANXIOUSLY AWAITED BY BOTH CONVICTS IN THE PRESSYARD AND THEIR FRIENDS COLLECTED IN A CROWD OUTSIDE THE GATES
LJ008-0298 SOMETIMES THE REPORT WAS DELAYED
LJ008-0299 ON ONE OCCASION MR. WAKEFIELD TELLS US THE RECORDER WHO HAD ATTENDED THE COUNCIL AT WINDSOR DID NOT DELIVER THE REPORT TILL THE FOLLOWING DAY
LJ008-0300 THE PRISONERS AND THEIR FRIENDS THEREFORE WERE KEPT IN A STATE OF THE MOST VIOLENT SUSPENSE FOR MANY HOURS
LJ008-0301 DURING WHICH THEY COUNTED THE MOMENTS  THE PRISONERS IN THEIR CELLS AS USUAL AND THEIR FRIENDS IN THE STREET IN FRONT OF NEWGATE WHERE THEY PASSED THE NIGHT
LJ008-0302 I HAVE HEARD THE PROTRACTED AGONY OF BOTH CLASSES DESCRIBED BY THOSE WHO WITNESSED IT IN TERMS SO STRONG THAT I AM UNWILLING TO REPEAT THEM
LJ008-0303 THE CROWD OF MEN AND WOMEN WHO PASSED THE NIGHT IN FRONT OF NEWGATE BEGAN AS SOON AS THE HOUR WAS PASSED WHEN THEY HAD EXPECTED THE REPORT
LJ008-0304 TO UTTER IMPRECATIONS AGAINST THE RECORDER THE SECRETARY OF STATE THE COUNCIL AND THE KING
LJ008-0305 THEY NEVER CEASED CURSING UNTIL THE PASSION OF ANGER SO EXCITED WAS EXCHANGED FOR JOY IN SOME AND GRIEF IN OTHERS
LJ008-0306 I MYSELF HEARD MORE THAN ONE OF THOSE WHOSE LIVES WERE SPARED BY THAT DECISION OF THE COUNCIL
LJ008-0307 AFTERWARDS EXPRESS A WISH TO MURDER THE RECORDER FOR HAVING KEPT THEM SO LONG IN SUSPENSE
LJ008-0308 THE RECORDER'S REPORT GENERALLY REACHED NEWGATE LATE AT NIGHT
LJ008-0309 ITS RECEIPT WAS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY THE PROMULGATION OF ITS CONTENTS TO THE PERSONS MOST CLOSELY CONCERNED
LJ008-0310 WHICH WAS DONE WITH A SORT OF CEREMONY INTENDED TO BE IMPRESSIVE
LJ008-0311 THE WHOLE OF THE CONVICTS WERE ASSEMBLED TOGETHER IN ONE WARD AND MADE TO KNEEL DOWN
LJ008-0312 TO THEM ENTERED THE CHAPLAIN OR ORDINARY OF NEWGATE IN FULL CANONICALS
LJ008-0313 WHO IN SOLEMN TONES COMMUNICATED TO EACH IN TURN THE FATE IN STORE FOR HIM
LJ008-0314 THE FORM OF IMPARTING THE INTELLIGENCE WAS GENERALLY THE SAME
LJ008-0315 SOANDSO I AM SORRY TO TELL YOU THAT IT IS ALL AGAINST YOU OR
LJ008-0316 A. B. YOUR CASE HAS BEEN TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION BY THE KING IN COUNCIL AND HIS MAJESTY HAS BEEN MERCIFULLY PLEASED TO SPARE YOUR LIFE
LJ008-0317 THE FATAL NEWS WAS NOT ALWAYS RECEIVED IN THE SAME WAY
LJ008-0318 THE MEN WHO WERE DOOMED OFTEN FELL DOWN IN CONVULSIONS UPON THE FLOOR
LJ008-0319 SOMETIMES ANY WHO HAD HAD A NARROW ESCAPE FAINTED BUT THE BULK OF THOSE RESPITED LOOKED ON WITH UNFEELING INDIFFERENCE
LJ009-0001 THE CHRONICLES OF NEWGATE VOLUME 2. BY ARTHUR GRIFFITHS. SECTION 12 EXECUTIONS PART TWO
LJ009-0002 IT IS SATISFACTORY TO BE ABLE TO RECORD THAT SOME CONSIDERATION WAS SHOWN THE CAPITAL CONVICT ACTUALLY AWAITING EXECUTION
LJ009-0003 EVEN SO SEVERE A CRITIC AS MR. WAKEFIELD STATES THAT A STRANGER TO THE SCENE
LJ009-0004 WOULD BE ASTONISHED TO OBSERVE THE PECULIAR TENDERNESS I WAS GOING TO ADD RESPECT
LJ009-0005 WHICH PERSONS UNDER SENTENCE OF DEATH OBTAIN FROM ALL THE OFFICERS OF THE PRISON
LJ009-0006 BEFORE SENTENCE A PRISONER HAS ONLY TO OBSERVE THE REGULATIONS OF THE JAIL IN ORDER TO REMAIN NEGLECTED AND UNNOTICED
LJ009-0007 ONCE ORDERED TO THE CELLS FRIENDS OF ALL CLASSES SUDDENLY RISE UP HIS FELLOWPRISONERS THE TURNKEYS THE CHAPLAIN
LJ009-0008 THE KEEPERS AND THE SHERIFFS ALL SEEM INTERESTED IN HIS FATE AND HE CAN MAKE NO REASONABLE REQUEST THAT IS NOT AT ONCE GRANTED BY WHOMSOEVER HE MAY ADDRESS
LJ009-0009 THIS RULE HAS SOME BUT VERY FEW EXCEPTIONS SUCH AS WHERE A HARDENED OFFENDER BEHAVES WITH GREAT LEVITY AND BRUTALITY AS IF HE CARED NOUGHT FOR HIS LIFE
LJ009-0010 AND THOUGHT EVERY ONE ANXIOUS TO PROMOTE HIS DEATH
LJ009-0011 MR. WAKEFIELD GOES ON TO REMARK THAT PERSONS CONVICTED OF FORGERY EXCITED AN EXTRAORDINARY DEGREE OF INTEREST IN ALL WHO APPROACHED THEM
LJ009-0012 THIS WAS NOTICEABLE WITH FAUNTLEROY WHO ON ACCOUNT OF HIS BIRTH AND ANTECEDENTS WAS ALLOWED TO OCCUPY A TURNKEY'S ROOM
LJ009-0013 AND KEPT ALTOGETHER SEPARATE FROM THE OTHER PRISONERS UNTIL THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
LJ009-0014 IT CANNOT BE DENIED HOWEVER THAT THE ORDINARY'S TREATMENT WAS SOMEWHAT UNFEELING AND IN PROOF THEREOF
LJ009-0015 I WILL QUOTE AN EXTRACT FROM THE REVEREND GENTLEMAN'S OWN JOURNAL
LJ009-0016 HE SEEMS TO HAVE IMPROVED THE OCCASION WHEN PREACHING THE CONDEMNED SERMON BEFORE FAUNTLEROY BY POINTING A MORAL FROM THAT UNHAPPY MAN'S OWN CASE
LJ009-0017 FOR THIS THE CHAPLAIN WAS A FEW DAYS LATER SUMMONED BEFORE THE JAIL COMMITTEE OF ALDERMEN
LJ009-0018 AND INFORMED THAT THE PUBLIC WOULD NOT IN FUTURE BE ADMITTED TO HEAR THE CONDEMNED SERMON. I WAS ALSO INFORMED WRITES MR. COTTON
LJ009-0019 THAT THIS RESOLUTION WAS IN CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR THE ALDERMEN'S DISAPPROVING OF THE LAST DISCOURSE DELIVERED BY ME
LJ009-0020 PREVIOUS TO THE EXECUTION OF HENRY FAUNTLEROY FOR UTTERING A FORGED SECURITY
LJ009-0021 IN WHICH IT WAS SAID I HAD ENLARGED UPON THE HEINOUS NATURE OF HIS CRIME AND WARNED THE PUBLIC TO AVOID SUCH CONDUCT
LJ009-0022 I WAS INFORMED THAT THIS UNNECESSARILY HARASSED HIS FEELINGS AND THAT THE OBJECT OF SUCH SERMONS WAS SOLELY TO CONSOLE THE PRISONER
LJ009-0023 AND THAT FROM THE TIME OF HIS CONVICTION NOTHING BUT WHAT IS CONSOLATORY SHOULD BE ADDRESSED TO A CRIMINAL
LJ009-0024 ONE OF THE ALDERMEN MOREOVER INFORMED ME THAT THE WHOLE COURT OF ALDERMEN WERE UNANIMOUS IN THEIR OPINION ON THIS SUBJECT
LJ009-0025 AS TO THE EXCLUSION OF STRANGERS ON THESE OCCASIONS
LJ009-0026 THE EXPERIENCE I HAVE HAD CONVINCES ME THAT ONE AND PERHAPS THE ONLY GOOD OF AN EXECUTION I. E. THE SOLEMN ADMONITION TO THE PUBLIC
LJ009-0027 WILL THEREBY BE LOST
LJ009-0028 PROBABLY THE READER WILL SIDE WITH THE ALDERMEN AGAINST THE ORDINARY
LJ009-0029 THIS EPISODE THROWS SOME DOUBT UPON THE TENDERNESS AND PROPER FEELING EXHIBITED BY THE CHAPLAIN TOWARDS THE MOST DESERVING MEMBERS OF HIS CRIMINAL FLOCK
LJ009-0030 AND THE IDEA WILL BE STRENGTHENED BY THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNT OF THE SUNDAY SERVICE IN THE PRISON CHAPEL ON THE OCCASION WHEN THE CONDEMNED SERMON WAS PREACHED
LJ009-0031 THE EXTRACT IS FROM MR. E. GIBBON WAKEFIELD'S BROCHURE THE DATE EIGHTEEN TWENTY EIGHT JUST THREE YEARS AFTER FAUNTLEROY'S DEATH
LJ009-0032 STRANGERS WERE NOW EXCLUDED BUT THE SHERIFFS ATTENDED IN STATE WEARING THEIR GOLD CHAINS
LJ009-0033 WHILE BEHIND THEIR PEW STOOD A COUPLE OF TALL FOOTMEN IN STATE LIVERIES
LJ009-0034 THE SHERIFFS WERE IN ONE GALLERY
LJ009-0035 IN THE OTHER OPPOSITE WERE THE CONVICTS CAPITALLY CONVICTED WHO HAD BEEN RESPITED
LJ009-0036 DOWN BELOW BETWEEN THE GALLERIES WAS THE MASS OF THE PRISON POPULATION
LJ009-0037 THE SCHOOLMASTER AND THE JUVENILE PRISONERS BEING SEATED ROUND THE COMMUNIONTABLE OPPOSITE THE PULPIT
LJ009-0038 IN THE CENTER OF THE CHAPEL WAS THE CONDEMNED PEW A LARGE DOCKLIKE ERECTION PAINTED BLACK
LJ009-0039 THOSE WHO SAT IN IT WERE VISIBLE TO THE WHOLE CONGREGATION AND STILL MORE TO THE ORDINARY
LJ009-0040 WHOSE DESK AND PULPIT WERE JUST IN FRONT OF THE CONDEMNED PEW AND WITHIN A COUPLE OF YARDS OF IT
LJ009-0041 THE OCCUPANTS OF THIS TERRIBLE BLACK PEW WERE THE LAST ALWAYS TO ENTER THE CHAPEL
LJ009-0042 UPON THE OCCASION WHICH I AM DESCRIBING THEY WERE FOUR IN NUMBER AND HERE I WILL CONTINUE THE NARRATIVE IN MR. WAKEFIELD'S OWN WORDS
LJ009-0043 FIRST IS A YOUTH OF EIGHTEEN CONDEMNED FOR STEALING IN A DWELLINGHOUSE GOODS VALUED ABOVE FIVE POUNDS
LJ009-0044 HIS FEATURES HAVE NO FELONIOUS CAST
LJ009-0045 HE STEPS BOLDLY WITH HEAD UPRIGHT LOOKS TO THE WOMEN'S GALLERY AND SMILES. HIS INTENTION IS TO PASS FOR A BRAVE FELLOW
LJ009-0046 BUT THE ATTEMPT FAILS HE TREMBLES HIS KNEES KNOCK TOGETHER AND HIS HEAD DROOPS AS HE ENTERS THE CONDEMNED PEW
LJ009-0047 THE NEXT CONVICT IS CLEARLY AND UNMISTAKABLY A VILLAIN
LJ009-0048 HE IS A HARDENED OFFENDER PREVIOUSLY CAST FOR LIFE REPRIEVED TRANSPORTED TO AUSTRALIA AND SINCE RETURNED WITHOUT PARDON
LJ009-0049 FOR THIS OFFENSE THE PUNISHMENT IS DEATH
LJ009-0050 HE HAS HOWEVER DOUBLY EARNED HIS SENTENCE AND IS ACTUALLY CONDEMNED FOR BURGLARY COMMITTED SINCE HIS ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND
LJ009-0051 HIS LOOK AT THE SHERIFFS AND THE ORDINARY IS FULL OF SCORN AND DEFIANCE
LJ009-0052 THE THIRD CONVICT IS A SHEEPSTEALER A POOR IGNORANT FELLOW IN WHOSE CRIME ARE MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES
LJ009-0053 BUT WHO IS LEFT TO DIE ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT THIS IS NOT HIS FIRST CONVICTION AND STILL MORE BECAUSE A GOOD MANY SHEEP HAVE OF LATE BEEN STOLEN BY OTHER PEOPLE
LJ009-0054 HE IS QUITE CONTENT TO DIE
LJ009-0055 INDEED THE CHAPLAIN AND OTHERS HAVE BROUGHT HIM FIRMLY TO BELIEVE THAT HIS SITUATION IS ENVIABLE AND THAT THE GATES OF HEAVEN ARE OPEN TO RECEIVE HIM
LJ009-0056 THE LAST OF THE FOUR IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN A CLERGYMAN OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND CONDEMNED FOR FORGERY A MISERABLE OLD MAN IN A TATTERED SUIT OF BLACK
LJ009-0057 ALREADY HE IS HALF DEAD
LJ009-0058 GREAT EFFORTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO SAVE HIS LIFE
LJ009-0059 FRIENDS EVEN UTTER STRANGERS HAVE INTERCEDED FOR HIM AND TO THE LAST HE HAS BUOYED HIMSELF UP BY HOPE OF REPRIEVE
LJ009-0060 NOW HIS DOOM IS SEALED IRREVOCABLY AND HE HAS GIVEN HIMSELF UP TO DESPAIR
LJ009-0061 HE STAGGERS TOWARDS THE PEW REELS INTO IT STUMBLES FORWARD FLINGS HIMSELF ON THE GROUND AND BY A CURIOUS TWIST OF THE SPINE
LJ009-0062 BURIES HIS HEAD UNDER HIS BODY
LJ009-0063 THE SHERIFFS SHUDDER THEIR INQUISITIVE FRIENDS CRANE FORWARD THE KEEPER FROWNS ON THE EXCITED CONGREGATION
LJ009-0064 THE LATELY SMIRKING FOOTMEN CLOSE THEIR EYES AND FORGET THEIR LIVERIES THE ORDINARY CLASPS HIS HANDS THE TURNKEYS CRY 'HUSH'
LJ009-0065 AND THE OLD CLERK LIFTS UP HIS CRACKED VOICE SAYING 'LET US SING TO THE PRAISE AND GLORY OF GOD.'
LJ009-0066 THE MORNING HYMN IS SUNG FIRST AS IF TO REMIND THE CONDEMNED THAT NEXT MORNING AT EIGHT A.M. THEY ARE TO DIE
LJ009-0067 THE SERVICE PROCEEDS. AT LAST THE BURIAL SERVICE IS REACHED
LJ009-0068 THE YOUTH ALONE IS ABLE TO READ BUT FROM LONG WANT OF PRACTICE HE IS AT A LOSS TO FIND THE PLACE IN HIS PRAYERBOOK
LJ009-0069 THE ORDINARY OBSERVES HIM LOOKS TO THE SHERIFFS AND SAYS ALOUD 'THE SERVICE FOR THE DEAD'
LJ009-0070 THE YOUTH'S HANDS TREMBLE AS THEY HOLD THE BOOK UPSIDE DOWN
LJ009-0071 THE BURGLAR IS HEARD TO MUTTER AN ANGRY OATH
LJ009-0072 THE SHEEPSTEALER SMILES AND EXTENDING HIS ARMS UPWARDS LOOKS WITH A GLAD EXPRESSION TO THE ROOF OF THE CHAPEL
LJ009-0073 THE FORGER HAS NEVER MOVED
LJ009-0074 LET US PASS ON
LJ009-0075 ALL HAVE SUNG 'THE LAMENTATION OF A SINNER' AND HAVE SEEMED TO PRAY 'ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE NOW AWAITING THE AWFUL EXECUTION OF THE LAW.'
LJ009-0076 WE COME TO THE SERMON
LJ009-0077 THE ORDINARY OF NEWGATE IS AN ORTHODOX UNAFFECTED CHURCH OF ENGLAND DIVINE
LJ009-0078 WHO PREACHES PLAIN HOMELY DISCOURSES AS FIT AS ANY RELIGIOUS DISCOURSE CAN BE FIT FOR THE IRRITATED AUDIENCE
LJ009-0079 THE SERMON OF THIS DAY WHETHER ELOQUENT OR PLAIN USEFUL OR USELESS MUST PRODUCE A STRIKING EFFECT AT THE MOMENT OF ITS DELIVERY
LJ009-0080 THE TEXT WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD IS ENOUGH TO RAISE THE WILDEST PASSIONS OF THE AUDIENCE
LJ009-0081 FOR A WHILE THE PREACHER ADDRESSES HIMSELF TO THE CONGREGATION AT LARGE WHO LISTEN ATTENTIVELY
LJ009-0082 EXCEPT THE CLERGYMAN AND THE BURGLAR THE FORMER OF WHOM IS STILL ROLLED UP AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CONDEMNED PEW
LJ009-0083 WHILE THE EYES OF THE LATTER ARE WANDERING ROUND THE CHAPEL AND ONE OF THEM IS OCCASIONALLY WINKED IMPUDENTLY AT SOME ACQUAINTANCE AMONGST THE PRISONERS FOR TRIAL
LJ009-0084 AT LENGTH THE ORDINARY PAUSES AND THEN IN A DEEP TONE WHICH THOUGH HARDLY ABOVE A WHISPER IS AUDIBLE TO ALL SAYS
LJ009-0085 'NOW FOR YOU MY POOR FELLOW MORTALS WHO ARE ABOUT TO SUFFER THE LAST PENALTY OF THE LAW.'
LJ009-0086 BUT WHY SHOULD I REPEAT THE WHOLE
LJ009-0087 IT IS ENOUGH TO SAY THAT IN THE SAME SOLEMN TONE HE TALKS ABOUT THE MINUTEST OF CRIMES PUNISHMENTS BONDS SHAME
LJ009-0088 IGNOMINY SORROW SUFFERINGS WRETCHEDNESS PANGS
LJ009-0089 CHILDLESS PARENTS WIDOWS AND HELPLESS ORPHANS BROKEN AND CONTRITE HEARTS AND DEATH TOMORROW MORNING FOR THE BENEFIT OF SOCIETY
LJ009-0090 THE DYING MEN ARE DREADFULLY AGITATED
LJ009-0091 THE YOUNG STEALER IN A DWELLINGHOUSE NO LONGER HAS THE LEAST PRETENSE TO BRAVERY. HE GRASPS THE BACK OF THE PEW
LJ009-0092 HIS LEGS GIVE WAY HE UTTERS A FAINT GROAN AND SINKS ON THE FLOOR
LJ009-0093 WHY DOES NO ONE STIR TO HELP HIM WHERE WOULD BE THE USE THE HARDENED BURGLAR MOVES NOT NOR DOES HE SPEAK
LJ009-0094 BUT HIS FACE IS OF AN ASHY PALENESS AND IF YOU LOOK CAREFULLY YOU MAY SEE THE BLOOD TRICKLING FROM HIS LIP
LJ009-0095 WHICH HE HAS BITTEN UNCONSCIOUSLY OR FROM RAGE OR TO ROUSE HIS FAINTING COURAGE
LJ009-0096 THE POOR SHEEPSTEALER IS IN A FRENZY
LJ009-0097 HE THROWS HIS HANDS FAR FROM HIM AND SHOUTS ALOUD 'MERCY GOOD LORD MERCY IS ALL I ASK THE LORD IN HIS MERCY COME
LJ009-0098 THERE THERE I SEE THE LAMB OF GOD OH HOW HAPPY OH THIS IS HAPPY
LJ009-0099 MEANWHILE THE CLERGYMAN STILL BENT INTO THE FORM OF A SLEEPING DOG
LJ009-0100 STRUGGLES VIOLENTLY HIS FEET LEGS HANDS AND ARMS EVEN THE MUSCLES OF HIS BACK
LJ009-0101 MOVE WITH A QUICK JERKING MOTION NOT NATURALLY BUT AS IT WERE LIKE THE AFFECTED PARTS OF A GALVANIZED CORPSE
LJ009-0102 SUDDENLY HE UTTERS A SHORT SHARP SCREAM AND ALL IS STILL
LJ009-0103 THE SILENCE IS SHORT AS THE ORDINARY PROCEEDS 'TO CONCLUDE'
LJ009-0104 THE WOMEN SET UP A YELL WHICH IS MIXED WITH A RUSTLING NOISE OCCASIONED BY THE REMOVAL OF THOSE WHOSE HYSTERICS HAVE ENDED IN FAINTING
LJ009-0105 THE SHERIFFS COVER THEIR FACES AND ONE OF THEIR INQUISITIVE FRIENDS BLOWS HIS NOSE WITH HIS GLOVE
LJ009-0106 THE KEEPER TRIES TO APPEAR UNMOVED BUT HIS EYE WANDERS ANXIOUSLY OVER THE COMBUSTIBLE ASSEMBLY
LJ009-0107 THE CHILDREN ROUND THE COMMUNIONTABLE STARE AND GAPE WITH CHILDISH WONDER
LJ009-0108 THE TWO MASSES OF PRISONERS FOR TRIAL UNDULATE AND SLIGHTLY MURMUR
LJ009-0109 WHILE THE CAPITAL CONVICTS WHO WERE LATELY IN THAT BLACK PEW APPEAR FAINT WITH EMOTION
LJ009-0110 THIS EXHIBITION LASTS FOR SOME MINUTES AND THEN THE CONGREGATION DISPERSES
LJ009-0111 THE CONDEMNED RETURNING TO THE CELLS THE FORGER CARRIED BY TURNKEYS THE YOUTH SOBBING ALOUD CONVULSIVELY AS A PASSIONATE CHILD
LJ009-0112 THE BURGLAR MUTTERING CURSES AND SAVAGE EXPRESSIONS OF DEFIANCE WHILST THE POOR SHEEPSTEALER SHAKES HANDS WITH THE TURNKEYS
LJ009-0113 WHISTLES MERRILY AND POINTS UPWARDS WITH MADNESS IN HIS LOOK
LJ009-0114 MR. WAKEFIELD WINDS UP HIS GRAPHIC BUT SOMEWHAT SENSATIONAL ACCOUNT BY DESCRIBING ANOTHER RELIGIOUS SERVICE WHICH MAY APPROPRIATELY BE INSERTED HERE
LJ009-0115 HE SAYS ON THE DAY OF EXECUTION THERE IS NO SERVICE IN THE CHAPEL OF NEWGATE
LJ009-0116 ON THE FOLLOWING DAY THE CAPITAL CONVICTS WHOSE COMPANIONS HAVE BEEN HANGED ARE REQUIRED TO RETURN THANKS FOR THEIR NARROW ESCAPE
LJ009-0117 THE FIRMEST DISBELIEVER IN RELIGION IF HE HAD NOT LATELY BEEN IRRITATED BY TAKING PART IN SUCH A SCENE AS THE CONDEMNED SERVICE IN NEWGATE
LJ009-0118 COULD HARDLY WITNESS THIS CEREMONY WITHOUT BEING AFFECTED. THE MEN WHO WERE SO LATELY SNATCHED FROM THE JAWS OF DEATH
LJ009-0119 KNEEL WHILST THE REST OF THE CONGREGATION SIT AND THE ORDINARY IN A TONE OF PECULIAR SOLEMNITY SAYS
LJ009-0120 ALMIGHTY GOD FATHER OF ALL MERCIES WE THINE UNWORTHY SERVANTS DO GIVE THEE MOST HUMBLE AND HEARTY THANKS
LJ009-0121 FOR ALL THY GOODNESS AND LOVINGKINDNESS TO US AND TO ALL MEN
LJ009-0122 PARTICULARLY TO THOSE WHO DESIRE NOW TO OFFER UP THEIR PRAISES AND THANKSGIVINGS FOR THY LATE MERCIES VOUCHSAFED UNTO THEM
LJ009-0123 COULD ANY ONE KNOWING THE LATE SITUATION OF THE KNEELING MEN LOOKING AS THEY DO AT THE EMPTY PEW
LJ009-0124 OCCUPIED WHEN THEY SAW IT LAST BUT A FEW HOURS AGO BY THEIR COMRADES WHO ARE NOW DEAD
LJ009-0125 COULD ANY ONE NOT DISGUSTED WITH THE RELIGIOUS CEREMONIALS OF NEWGATE WITNESS THIS SCENE WITHOUT EMOTION
LJ009-0126 HARDLY ANY ONE
LJ009-0127 BUT WHAT ARE THE FEELINGS OF THOSE WHO TAKE PART IN IT
LJ009-0128 I HAVE BEEN PRESENT AT THE SCENE NOT LESS THAN TWENTY TIMES AND HAVE INVARIABLY OBSERVED
LJ009-0129 THAT MANY OF THE KNEELING MEN OR BOYS LAUGHED WHILE THEY KNELT PINCHED EACH OTHER AND WHEN THEY COULD DO SO WITHOUT FEAR OF BEING SEEN BY ANY OFFICER OF THE PRISON
LJ009-0130 WINKED AT OTHER PRISONERS IN DERISION OF WHAT WAS TAKING PLACE AND I HAVE FREQUENTLY HEARD MEN AND LADS WHO HAD BEEN OF THE KNEELING PARTY
LJ009-0131 BOAST TO THEIR COMPANIONS AFTER THE SERVICE THAT THEY HAD WIPED THEIR EYES DURING THE THANKSGIVING TO MAKE THE ORDINARY BELIEVE THEY HAD BEEN CRYING
LJ009-0132 ALTHOUGH THIS MISAPPLICATION OF RELIGIOUS SERVICES STILL WENT ON
LJ009-0133 THE OUTSIDE PUBLIC CONTINUED TO BE EXCLUDED FROM THE NEWGATE CHAPEL ON THE DAY THE CONDEMNED SERMON WAS PREACHED
LJ009-0134 THIS VERY PROPER RULE WAS HOWEVER SET ASIDE ON THE SUNDAY PRECEDING COURVOISIER'S EXECUTION
LJ009-0135 SO MANY APPLICATIONS FOR ADMISSION WERE MADE TO THE SHERIFFS
LJ009-0136 THAT THEY RELUCTANTLY AGREED TO OPEN THE GALLERY WHICH HAD FORMERLY BEEN OCCUPIED BY STRANGERS ON THESE OCCASIONS
LJ009-0137 CARDS WERE ISSUED AND TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT ALTHOUGH THE SERVICE WAS NOT TO COMMENCE TILL HALFPAST TEN BY NINE A.M.
LJ009-0138 ALL THE AVENUES TO THE PRISON GATES WERE BLOCKED BY TICKETHOLDERS
LJ009-0139 IN SPITE OF THE THRONG OWING TO THE EXCELLENT ARRANGEMENTS MADE BY THE SHERIFFS
LJ009-0140 NO INCONVENIENCE WAS SUFFERED BY THE CONGREGATION AMONG WHOM WERE LORD ADOLPHUS FITZ CLARENCE LORD COVENTRY
LJ009-0141 LORD PAGET LORD BRUCE SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND A FEW LADIES
LJ009-0142 CONTEMPORARY ACCOUNTS GIVE A MINUTE DESCRIPTION OF THE DEMEANOR OF THE CONVICT UPON THIS SOLEMN OCCASION
LJ009-0143 HE SAT ON A BENCH BEFORE THE PULPIT  THE HIDEOUS CONDEMNED PEW HAD BEEN SWEPT AWAY  AND NEVER ONCE RAISED HIS EYES DURING THE SERVICE
LJ009-0144 IN FACT HIS LOOKS DENOTED EXTREME SORROW AND CONTRITION
LJ009-0145 AND HE SEEMED TO SUFFER GREAT INWARD AGITATION WHEN THE ORDINARY PARTICULARLY ALLUDED TO THE CRIME FOR THE PERPETRATION OF WHICH HE STOOD CONDEMNED
LJ009-0146 MR. CARVER THE ORDINARY APPEARS TO HAVE ADDRESSED HIMSELF DIRECTLY TO COURVOISIER
LJ009-0147 AND TO HAVE DWELT WITH MORE EMPHASIS THAN GOOD TASTE UPON THE NATURE OF THE CRIME AND THE NECESSITY FOR REPENTANCE
LJ009-0148 BUT THE CHAPLAIN ADMITTED THAT THE SOLITUDE OF THE CONVICT'S CELL
LJ009-0149 WAS MORE APPROPRIATE FOR SERIOUS REFLECTION AND PROFITABLE MINISTRATION THAN THIS EXCITING OCCASION BEFORE A LARGE AND PUBLIC ASSEMBLY
LJ009-0150 SO FAR AS I CAN FIND COURVOISIER WAS THE LAST CONDEMNED CRIMINAL WHO WAS THUS EXHIBITED TO A CROWD OF MORBIDLY CURIOUS SPECTATORS
LJ009-0151 THE ATROCITY OF THE MURDER NO DOUBT ATTRACTED EXTRAORDINARY ATTENTION TO IT
LJ009-0152 THE CROWD OUTSIDE NEWGATE ON THE DAY OF EXECUTION HAS ALREADY BEEN DESCRIBED BUT THERE WAS ALSO A SELECT GATHERING OF DISTINGUISHED VISITORS WITHIN THE JAIL
LJ009-0153 FIRST CAME THE SHERIFFS THE UNDERSHERIFFS AND SEVERAL ALDERMEN AND CITY OFFICIALS THEN LORD POWERSCOURT AND SEVERAL OTHER PEERS OF THE REALM
LJ009-0154 MR. CHARLES KEAN THE TRAGEDIAN WAS ALSO PRESENT
LJ009-0155 DRAWN TO THIS TERRIBLE EXHIBITION BY THE EXAMPLE OF HIS FATHER THE MORE CELEBRATED EDMUND KEAN WHO HAD WITNESSED THE EXECUTION OF THISTLEWOOD
LJ009-0156 WITH A VIEW AS HE HIMSELF SAID TO HIS PROFESSIONAL STUDIES
LJ009-0157 BUT THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT THAT AS EXECUTIONS BECAME MORE RARE THEY MADE MORE IMPRESSION ON THE PUBLIC MIND
LJ009-0158 ALREADY A STRONG DISLIKE TO THE RECKLESS AND ALMOST INDISCRIMINATE APPLICATION OF THE EXTREME PENALTY WAS APPARENT IN ALL CLASSES
LJ009-0159 AND THE MITIGATION OF THE CRIMINAL CODE FOR WHICH ROMILLY HAD SO STRENUOUSLY LABORED WAS DAILY MORE AND MORE OF AN ACCOMPLISHED FACT
LJ009-0160 IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO
LJ009-0161 CAPITAL PUNISHMENT WAS ABOLISHED FOR FORGERY EXCEPT IN CASES OF FORGING OR ALTERING WILLS OR POWERS OF ATTORNEY TO TRANSFER STOCK
LJ009-0162 NEVERTHELESS AFTER THAT DATE NO PERSON WHATEVER WAS EXECUTED FOR THIS OFFENSE
LJ009-0163 IN THE SAME YEAR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT WAS FURTHER RESTRICTED AND CEASED TO BE THE LEGAL SENTENCE FOR COINING
LJ009-0164 SHEEP OR HORSE STEALING AND STEALING IN A DWELLINGHOUSE
LJ009-0165 HOUSEBREAKING AS DISTINGUISHED FROM BURGLARY WAS SIMILARLY EXEMPTED IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR
LJ009-0166 NEXT THE OFFENSES OF RETURNING FROM TRANSPORTATION STEALING POSTOFFICE LETTERS AND SACRILEGE WERE NO LONGER PUNISHABLE WITH DEATH
LJ009-0167 IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN LORD JOHN RUSSELL'S ACTS SWEPT AWAY A NUMBER OF CAPITAL OFFENSES INCLUDING CUTTING AND MAIMING RICKBURNING
LJ009-0168 ROBBERY BURGLARY AND ARSON
LJ009-0169 WITHIN A COUPLE OF YEARS THE NUMBER OF PERSONS SENTENCED TO DEATH IN ENGLAND HAD FALLEN FROM FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTYEIGHT IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN
LJ009-0170 TO FIFTYSIX IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE
LJ009-0171 GRADUALLY THE APPLICATION OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT BECAME MORE AND MORE RESTRICTED AND WAS SOON THE PENALTY FOR MURDER ALONE
LJ009-0172 WHILE IN LONDON FOR INSTANCE IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINE TWENTYFOUR PERSONS HAD BEEN EXECUTED FOR CRIMES OTHER THAN MURDER
LJ009-0173 FROM EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO TO EIGHTEEN FORTY FOUR NOT A SINGLE PERSON HAD BEEN EXECUTED IN THE METROPOLIS EXCEPT FOR THIS THE GRAVEST CRIME
LJ009-0174 IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN THE DEATH PENALTY WAS PRACTICALLY LIMITED TO MURDER OR ATTEMPTS TO MURDER
LJ009-0175 AND IN 1841 THIS WAS ACCEPTED AS THE ALMOST UNIVERSALLY ESTABLISHED RULE
LJ009-0176 SEVEN OTHER CRIMES HOWEVER WERE STILL CAPITAL BY LAW AND SO CONTINUED TILL THE PASSING OF THE CRIMINAL CONSOLIDATION ACTS OF 1861
LJ009-0177 WITH THE AMELIORATION OF THE CRIMINAL CODE OTHER CRUEL CONCOMITANTS OF EXECUTION ALSO DISAPPEARED
LJ009-0178 IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO THE DISSECTION OF BODIES CUT DOWN FROM THE GALLOWS WHICH HAD BEEN DECREED CENTURIES PREVIOUSLY WAS ABOLISHED
LJ009-0179 THE MOST RECENT ENACTMENT IN FORCE WAS THE 9TH GEORGE IV. CAP. 31 WHICH DIRECTED THE DISSECTION OF ALL BODIES OF EXECUTED MURDERERS
LJ009-0180 THE IDEA BEING TO INTENSIFY THE DREAD OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT. THAT SUCH DREAD WAS NOT UNIVERSAL OR DEEPSEATED MAY BE GATHERED FROM THE FACT
LJ009-0181 THAT AUTHENTIC CASES WERE KNOWN PREVIOUS TO THE FIRST CITED ACT OF CRIMINALS SELLING THEIR OWN BODIES TO SURGEONS FOR DISSECTION
LJ009-0182 THIS DISSECTION WAS CARRIED OUT FOR NEWGATE PRISONERS IN SURGEONS' HALL ADJOINING NEWGATE
LJ009-0183 THE SITE OF THE PRESENT SESSIONS HOUSE OF THE OLD BAILEY AND THE OPERATION WAS WITNESSED BY STUDENTS AND A NUMBER OF CURIOUS SPECTATORS
LJ009-0184 LORD FERRERS' BODY WAS BROUGHT TO SURGEONS' HALL AFTER EXECUTION IN HIS OWN CARRIAGE AND SIX
LJ009-0185 AFTER THE POST MORTEM HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT THE CORPSE WAS EXPOSED TO VIEW IN A FIRSTFLOOR ROOM
LJ009-0186 PENNANT SPEAKS OF SURGEONS' HALL AS A HANDSOME BUILDING ORNAMENTED WITH IONIC PILASTERS AND WITH A DOUBLE FLIGHT OF STEPS TO THE FIRST FLOOR
LJ009-0187 BENEATH IS A DOOR FOR THE ADMISSION OF THE BODIES OF MURDERERS AND OTHER FELONS. THERE WERE OTHER PUBLIC DISSECTING ROOMS FOR CRIMINALS
LJ009-0188 ONE WAS ATTACHED TO HICKS' HALL THE CLERKENWELL SESSIONS HOUSE BUILT OUT OF MONIES PROVIDED BY SIR BAPTIST HICKS A WEALTHY ALDERMAN OF THE REIGN OF JAMES I
LJ009-0189 PERSONS WERE STILL LIVING IN 1855 WHO HAD WITNESSED DISSECTIONS AT HICKS' HALL AND
LJ009-0190 WHOM THE HORRID SCENE WITH THE ADDITIONAL EFFECT OF SOME NOTED CRIMINALS HANGING ON THE WALLS DROVE OUT AGAIN SICK AND FAINT
LJ009-0191 AS WE HAVE HEARD SOME RELATE AND WITH PALE AND TERRIFIED FEATURES TO GET A BREATH OF AIR
LJ009-0192 THE DISSECTION OF EXECUTED CRIMINALS WAS ABOLISHED SOON AFTER THE DISCOVERY OF THE CRIME OF BURKING
LJ009-0193 WITH THE IDEA THAT IGNOMINY WOULD NO LONGER ATTACH TO AN OPERATION WHICH CEASED TO BE COMPULSORY FOR THE MOST DEGRADED BEINGS
LJ009-0194 AND THAT EXECUTORS OR PERSONS HAVING LAWFUL POSSESSION OF THE BODIES
LJ009-0195 OF PEOPLE WHO HAD DIED FRIENDLESS WOULD VOLUNTARILY SURRENDER THEM FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
LJ009-0196 ANOTHER BRUTAL PRACTICE HAD NEARLY DISAPPEARED ABOUT THE TIME OF THE ABOLITION OF DISSECTION. THIS WAS THE PUBLIC EXHIBITION OF THE BODY
LJ009-0197 AS WAS DONE IN THE CASE OF MRS. PHIPOE THE MURDERESS WHO WAS EXECUTED IN FRONT OF NEWGATE IN 1798
LJ009-0198 AND HER BODY PUBLICLY EXHIBITED IN A PLACE BUILT FOR THE PURPOSE IN THE OLD BAILEY
LJ009-0199 ABOUT THIS TIME I FIND THAT THE BODIES OF TWO MURDERERS CLENCH AND MACKAY
LJ009-0200 WERE PUBLICLY EXPOSED IN A STABLE IN LITTLE BRIDGE STREET NEAR APOTHECARIES' HALL
LJ009-0201 SURGEONS' HALL BEING LET TO THE LIEUTENANCY OF THE COUNTY FOR THE ACCOMMODATION OF THE MILITIA
LJ009-0202 IN 1811 WILLIAMS WHO MURDERED THE MARRS IN RATCLIFFE HIGHWAY HAVING COMMITTED SUICIDE IN JAIL TO ESCAPE HANGING
LJ009-0203 IT WAS DETERMINED THAT A PUBLIC EXHIBITION SHOULD BE MADE OF THE BODY THROUGH THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHICH HAD BEEN THE SCENE OF THE MONSTER'S CRIMES
LJ009-0204 A LONG PROCESSION WAS FORMED HEADED BY CONSTABLES WHO CLEARED THE WAY WITH THEIR STAVES
LJ009-0205 THEN CAME THE NEWLYFORMED HORSE PATROL WITH DRAWN CUTLASSES
LJ009-0206 PARISH OFFICERS PEACE OFFICERS THE HIGH CONSTABLE OF THE COUNTY OF MIDDLESEX ON HORSEBACK AND THEN THE BODY OF WILLIAMS
LJ009-0207 EXTENDED AT FULL LENGTH ON AN INCLINED PLATFORM
LJ009-0208 ERECTED ON THE CART ABOUT FOUR FEET HIGH AT THE HEAD AND GRADUALLY SLOPING TOWARDS THE HORSE GIVING A FULL VIEW OF THE BODY
LJ009-0209 WHICH WAS DRESSED IN BLUE TROUSERS AND A BLUEANDWHITE STRIPED WAISTCOAT BUT WITHOUT A COAT AS WHEN FOUND IN THE CELL
LJ009-0210 ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE HEAD THE FATAL MALL
LJ009-0211 AND ON THE RIGHT THE RIPPING CHISEL WITH WHICH THE MURDERS HAD BEEN COMMITTED WERE EXPOSED TO VIEW
LJ009-0212 THE COUNTENANCE OF WILLIAMS WAS GHASTLY IN THE EXTREME AND THE WHOLE HAD AN APPEARANCE TOO HORRIBLE FOR DESCRIPTION
LJ009-0213 THE PROCESSION TRAVERSED RATCLIFFE TWICE HALTING FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR IN FRONT OF THE VICTIMS' DWELLING
LJ009-0214 AND WAS ACCOMPANIED THROUGHOUT BY AN IMMENSE CONCOURSE OF PERSONS EAGER TO GET A SIGHT OF THE MURDERER'S REMAINS
LJ009-0215 ALL THE SHOPS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WERE SHUT AND THE WINDOWS AND TOPS OF THE HOUSES WERE CROWDED WITH SPECTATORS
LJ009-0216 HANGING IN CHAINS UPON THE GIBBET WHICH HAD SERVED FOR THE EXECUTION
LJ009-0217 OR ON ANOTHER SPECIALLY ERECTED ON SOME COMMANDING SPOT HAD FALLEN INTO DISUSE BY EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO
LJ009-0218 BUT THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT TO REVIVE IT AT THAT DATE WHEN THE ACT FOR DISPENSING WITH THE DISSECTION OF CRIMINALS WAS PASSED
LJ009-0219 A CLAUSE WAS INSERTED TO THE EFFECT THAT
LJ009-0220 THE BODIES OF ALL PRISONERS CONVICTED OF MURDER SHOULD EITHER BE HUNG IN CHAINS OR BURIED UNDER THE GALLOWS ON WHICH THEY HAD BEEN EXECUTED
LJ009-0221 ACCORDING TO THE DISCRETION OF THE COURT BEFORE WHOM THE PRISONERS MIGHT BE TRIED
LJ009-0222 THE REVIVAL OF THIS BARBAROUS PRACTICE CAUSED MUCH INDIGNATION IN CERTAIN QUARTERS
LJ009-0223 BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY TRIED IN TWO PROVINCIAL TOWNS LEICESTER AND DURHAM
LJ009-0224 AT THE FIRSTNAMED THE EXHIBITION NEARLY CREATED A TUMULT AND THE BODY WAS TAKEN DOWN AND BURIED
LJ009-0225 BUT NOT BEFORE THE GREATEST SCANDAL HAD BEEN CAUSED BY THE UNSEEMLY PROCEEDINGS OF THE CROWD THAT FLOCKED TO SEE THE SIGHT A SORT OF FAIR WAS HELD
LJ009-0226 GAMINGTABLES WERE SET UP CARDS WERE PLAYED UNDER THE GIBBET TO THE DISTURBANCE OF THE PUBLIC PEACE AND THE ANNOYANCE OF ALL DECENT PEOPLE
LJ009-0227 AT JARROW STAKE WHERE THE DURHAM MURDERER'S BODY WAS EXPOSED THERE WERE SIMILAR SCENES MINGLED WITH COMPASSION FOR THE CULPRIT'S FAMILY
LJ009-0228 AND A SUBSCRIPTION WAS SET ON FOOT FOR THEM THEN AND THERE AT THE FOOT OF THE GIBBET
LJ009-0229 LATER ON AFTER DARK SOME FRIENDS OF THE DECEASED STOLE THE BODY AND BURIED IT IN THE SAND AND THIS WAS THE END OF HANGING IN CHAINS
LJ009-0230 AFTER THIS A LAW WAS PASSED WHICH PRESCRIBED THAT THE BODIES OF ALL EXECUTED MURDERERS SHOULD BE BURIED WITHIN THE WALLS OF THE JAIL
LJ009-0231 ALTHOUGH THESE OBJECTIONABLE PRACTICES HAD DISAPPEARED
LJ009-0232 THERE WERE STILL MANY SHOCKING INCIDENTS AT EXECUTIONS OWING TO THE BUNGLING AND UNSKILFUL WAY IN WHICH THE OPERATION WAS PERFORMED
LJ009-0233 THE ROPE STILL BROKE SOMETIMES ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOT OFTEN THAT THE HORRID SCENE SEEN AT JERSEY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CENTURY WAS REPEATED
LJ009-0234 THERE THE HANGMAN ADDED HIS WEIGHT TO THAT OF THE SUSPENDED CULPRIT
LJ009-0235 AND HAVING FIRST PULLED HIM SIDEWAYS THEN GOT UPON HIS SHOULDERS SO THAT THE ROPE BROKE
LJ009-0236 TO THE GREAT SURPRISE OF ALL WHO WITNESSED THIS DREADFUL SCENE
LJ009-0237 THE POOR CRIMINAL ROSE STRAIGHT UPON HIS FEET WITH THE HANGMAN ON HIS SHOULDERS AND IMMEDIATELY LOOSENED THE ROPE WITH HIS FINGERS
LJ009-0238 AFTER THIS THE SHERIFFS SENT FOR ANOTHER ROPE BUT THE SPECTATORS INTERFERED AND THE MAN WAS CARRIED BACK TO JAIL
LJ009-0239 THE WHOLE CASE WAS REFERRED TO THE KING AND THE POOR WRETCH WHOSE CRIME HAD BEEN A MILITARY ONE WAS EVENTUALLY PARDONED
LJ009-0240 A SOMEWHAT SIMILAR EVENT HAPPENED AT CHESTER NOT LONG AFTERWARDS THE ROPES BY WHICH TWO OFFENDERS WERE TURNED OFF BROKE A FEW INCHES FROM THEIR NECKS
LJ009-0241 THEY WERE TAKEN BACK TO JAIL AND WERE AGAIN BROUGHT OUT IN THE AFTERNOON BY WHICH TIME FRESH AND STRONGER ROPES HAD BEEN PROCURED
LJ009-0242 AND THE SENTENCE WAS PROPERLY AND COMPLETELY CARRIED OUT
LJ009-0243 OTHER CASES MIGHT BE QUOTED
LJ009-0244 ESPECIALLY THAT OF WILLIAM SNOW ALIAS SKETCH WHO SLIPPED FROM THE GALLOWS AT EXETER AND FELL TO THE GROUND
LJ009-0245 HE SOON ROSE TO HIS FEET AND HEARING THE SORROWFUL EXCLAMATIONS OF THE POPULACE COOLLY SAID
LJ009-0246 GOOD PEOPLE DO NOT BE HURRIED I AM NOT I CAN WAIT
LJ009-0247 SIMILAR CASES WERE NOT WANTING AS REGARDS THE EXECUTIONS BEFORE NEWGATE. OTHERS WERE NOT LESS HORRIBLE ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO FAILURE OF APPARATUS
LJ009-0248 SOMETIMES THE CONDEMNED MAN MADE A HARD FIGHT FOR LIFE
LJ009-0249 WHEN CHARLES WHITE WAS EXECUTED IN 1823 FOR ARSON HE ARRANGED A HANDKERCHIEF
LJ009-0250 IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE EXECUTIONER FOUND A DIFFICULTY IN PINIONING HIS HANDS
LJ009-0251 WHITE MANAGED TO KEEP HIS WRISTS ASUNDER AND CONTINUED TO STRUGGLE WITH THE OFFICIALS FOR SOME TIME. EVENTUALLY HE WAS PINIONED WITH A CORD IN THE USUAL MANNER
LJ009-0252 ON THE SCAFFOLD HE MADE A VIOLENT ATTEMPT TO LOOSEN HIS BONDS AND SUCCEEDED IN GETTING HIS HANDS FREE
LJ009-0253 THEN WITH A STRONG EFFORT HE PUSHED OFF THE WHITE CAP AND TRIED TO LIBERATE HIS NECK FROM THE HALTER WHICH BY THIS TIME HAD BEEN ADJUSTED
LJ009-0254 THE HANGMAN SUMMONED ASSISTANCE AND WITH HELP TIED THE CAP OVER WHITE'S FACE WITH A HANDKERCHIEF
LJ009-0255 THE MISERABLE WRETCH DURING THE WHOLE OF THIS TIME WAS STRUGGLING WITH THE MOST DETERMINED VIOLENCE TO THE GREAT HORROR OF THE SPECTATORS
LJ009-0256 STILL HE RESISTED
LJ009-0257 AND HAVING GOT FROM THE FALLING DROP TO THE FIRM PART OF THE PLATFORM HE NEARLY SUCCEEDED IN TEARING THE HANDKERCHIEF FROM HIS EYES
LJ009-0258 HOWEVER THE CEREMONY WENT FORWARD AND WHEN THE SIGNAL WAS GIVEN THE DROP SANK
LJ009-0259 THE WRETCHED MAN DID NOT FALL WITH IT BUT JUMPED ON TO THE PLATFORM AND SEIZING THE ROPE WITH HIS HANDS TRIED TO AVOID STRANGULATION
LJ009-0260 THE SPECTACLE WAS HORRIBLE
LJ009-0261 THE CONVICT WAS HALF ON THE PLATFORM HALF HANGING AND THE CONVULSIONS OF HIS BODY WERE APPALLING
LJ009-0262 THE CROWD VOCIFEROUSLY YELLED THEIR DISAPPROVAL AND AT LENGTH
LJ009-0263 THE EXECUTIONER FORCED THE STRUGGLING CRIMINAL FROM THE PLATFORM SO THAT THE ROPE SUSTAINED HIS WHOLE WEIGHT
LJ009-0264 HIS FACE WAS VISIBLE TO THE WHOLE CROWD AND WAS FEARFUL TO BEHOLD
LJ009-0265 EVEN NOW HIS SUFFERINGS WERE NOT AT AN END
LJ009-0266 AND HIS DEATH WAS NOT COMPASSED UNTIL THE EXECUTIONER TERMINATED HIS SUFFERINGS BY HANGING ON TO HIS LEGS
LJ009-0267 WHEN LUIGI BURANELLI WAS EXECUTED IN 1855
LJ009-0268 THROUGH THE IMPROPER ADJUSTMENT OF THE ROPE HIS SUFFERINGS WERE PROLONGED FOR FIVE MINUTES
LJ009-0269 HIS CHEST HEAVED AND IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HIS STRUGGLE WAS A FEARFUL ONE
LJ009-0270 A WORSE CASE STILL WAS THAT OF WILLIAM BOUSFIELD WHO WHEN AWAITING EXECUTION FOR MURDER ABOUT THE SAME DATE
LJ009-0271 HAD ATTEMPTED TO THROW HIMSELF UPON THE FIRE IN HIS CONDEMNED CELL
LJ009-0272 HE WAS IN CONSEQUENCE SO WEAK WHEN BROUGHT OUT FOR EXECUTION THAT HE HAD TO BE CARRIED BY FOUR MEN
LJ009-0273 TWO SUPPORTING HIS BODY AND TWO HIS LEGS
LJ009-0274 HIS WRETCHED ABJECT CONDITION SEATED IN A CHAIR UNDER THE DROP WAS SUCH AS ALMOST TO UNNERVE THE EXECUTIONER CALCRAFT
LJ009-0275 WHO BAD BEEN FURTHER UPSET BY A LETTER THREATENING TO SHOOT HIM WHEN HE APPEARED TO PERFORM HIS TASK
LJ009-0276 CALCRAFT THE MOMENT HE HAD ADJUSTED THE CAP AND ROPE RAN DOWN THE STEPS DREW THE BOLT AND DISAPPEARED
LJ009-0277 FOR A SECOND OR TWO THE BODY HUNG MOTIONLESS THEN WITH A STRENGTH THAT ASTONISHED THE ATTENDANT OFFICIALS
LJ009-0278 BOUSFIELD SLOWLY DREW HIMSELF UP AND RESTED WITH HIS FEET ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE DROP
LJ009-0279 ONE OF THE TURNKEYS RUSHED FORWARD AND PUSHED HIM OFF
LJ009-0280 AGAIN THE WRETCHED CREATURE SUCCEEDED IN OBTAINING FOOTHOLD BUT THIS TIME ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE DROP
LJ009-0281 CALCRAFT WAS FORCED TO RETURN AND HE ONCE MORE PUSHED BOUSFIELD OFF
LJ009-0282 WHO FOR THE FOURTH TIME REGAINED HIS FOOTHOLD. AGAIN HE WAS REPELLED
LJ009-0283 THIS TIME CALCRAFT ADDING HIS WEIGHT TO THE BODY AND THE STRANGULATION WAS COMPLETED
LJ009-0284 IT WAS STATED IN EVIDENCE BEFORE THE COMMISSION ON CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IN 1864
LJ009-0285 THAT CALCRAFT'S METHOD OF HANGING WAS VERY ROUGH MUCH THE SAME AS IF HE HAD BEEN HANGING A DOG
LJ009-0286 THERE HAS NEVER BEEN MUCH SCIENCE IN THE SYSTEM OF CARRYING OUT THE EXTREME PENALTY IN THIS COUNTRY THE FINISHER OF THE LAW
LJ009-0287 HAS COME MORE BY CHANCE THAN FITNESS OR SPECIAL EDUCATION TO EXERCISE HIS LOATHSOME OFFICE
LJ009-0288 CALCRAFT OF WHOM MENTION HAS JUST BEEN MADE WAS BY TRADE A LADY'S SHOEMAKER
LJ009-0289 AND BEFORE HE TOOK TO HANGING HE WAS EMPLOYED AS A WATCHMAN AT REID'S BREWERY IN LIQUORPOND STREET
LJ009-0290 HE WAS AT FIRST ENGAGED AS ASSISTANT TO THE EXECUTIONER TOM CHESHIRE BUT IN DUE COURSE ROSE TO BE CHIEF
LJ009-0291 HE WAS ALWAYS KNOWN AS A MILDMANNERED MAN OF SIMPLE TASTES MUCH GIVEN TO ANGLING IN THE NEW RIVER AND A DEVOTED RABBIT FANCIER
LJ009-0292 HE WAS WELL KNOWN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE HE RESIDED AND THE STREET GAMINS CRIED JACK KETCH AS HE WENT ALONG THE STREET
LJ009-0293 WHILE CALCRAFT WAS IN OFFICE OTHER ASPIRANTS TO FAME APPEARED IN THE FIELD
LJ009-0294 ONE WAS ASKERN
LJ009-0295 WHO HAD BEEN A CONVICTED PRISONER AT YORK BUT WHO CONSENTED TO ACT AS HANGMAN WHEN CALCRAFT WAS ENGAGED AND NO OTHER FUNCTIONARY COULD BE OBTAINED
LJ009-0296 IT WAS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO HIRE A HANGMAN
LJ009-0297 THERE IS STILL EXTANT A CURIOUS PETITION PRESENTED TO THE TREASURY BY RALPH GRIFFITH ESQ. HIGH SHERIFF OF FLINTSHIRE
LJ009-0298 WHICH SETS FORTH THAT THE PETITIONER HAD BEEN AT GREAT EXPENSE BY SENDING CLERKS AND AGENTS TO LIVERPOOL AND SHREWSBURY TO HIRE AN EXECUTIONER
LJ009-0299 THE MAN TO BE HANGED BELONGED TO WALES AND NO WELSHMAN WOULD DO THE JOB
LJ009-0300 TRAVELING EXPENSES OF THESE AGENTS COST £15 AND ANOTHER £10 WERE SPENT IN THE HIRE OF A SHROPSHIRE MAN
LJ009-0301 WHO DESERTED AND WAS PURSUED BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS
LJ009-0302 ANOTHER MAN WAS HIRED HIMSELF A CONVICT WHOSE FEES FOR SELF AND WIFE WERE TWELVE GUINEAS
LJ009-0303 THEN CAME THE COST OF THE GALLOWS
LJ009-0304 4 POUNDS 12 SHILLINGS AND FINALLY THE FUNERAL CART COFFIN AND OTHER PETTY EXPENSES AMOUNTING TO SEVEN POUNDS 10
LJ010-0001 THE CHRONICLES OF NEWGATE VOLUME TWO BY ARTHUR GRIFFITHS SECTION THIRTEEN NEWGATE NOTORIETIES PART ONE
LJ010-0002 IN CHAPTER TWO OF THE PRESENT VOLUME I BROUGHT DOWN THE RECORD OF CRIME TO THE SECOND DECADE OF THE PRESENT CENTURY
LJ010-0003 I PROPOSE NOW TO CONTINUE THE SUBJECT AND TO DEVOTE A COUPLE OF CHAPTERS TO CRIMINAL OCCURRENCES OF A MORE RECENT DATE
LJ010-0004 ONLY PREMISING THAT AS ACCOUNTS BECOME MORE VOLUMINOUS I SHALL BE COMPELLED TO DEAL WITH FEWER CASES
LJ010-0005 TAKING IN PREFERENCE THOSE WHICH ARE TYPICAL AND INVESTED WITH PECULIAR INTEREST. IT IS SOMEWHAT REMARKABLE THAT A MARKED CHANGE SOON COMES OVER THE CALENDAR
LJ010-0006 CERTAIN CRIMES THOSE AGAINST THE PERSON ESPECIALLY DIMINISHED GRADUALLY. THEY BECAME LESS EASY OR REMUNERATIVE
LJ010-0007 POLICE PROTECTION WAS BETTER AND MORE EFFECTIVE
LJ010-0008 THE STREETS OF LONDON WERE WELL LIGHTED THE SUBURBS WERE MORE POPULOUS AND REGULARLY PATROLLED
LJ010-0009 PEOPLE TOO WERE GETTING INTO THE HABIT OF CARRYING BUT LITTLE CASH ABOUT THEM AND NO VALUABLES BUT THEIR WATCHES OR PERSONAL JEWELERY
LJ010-0010 STREET ROBBERIES OFFERED FEWER INDUCEMENTS TO DEPREDATORS AND EVILDOERS WERE COMPELLED TO ADOPT OTHER METHODS OF PREYING UPON THEIR FELLOWS
LJ010-0011 THIS LED TO A RAPID AND MARKED INCREASE IN ALL KINDS OF FRAUD
LJ010-0012 AND PROMINENT IN THE CRIMINAL ANNALS OF NEWGATE IN THESE LATER YEARS WILL BE FOUND NUMEROUS REMARKABLE INSTANCES OF THIS CLASS OF OFFENSE 
LJ010-0013 FORGERIES COMMITTED SYSTEMATICALLY AND FOR LONG PERIODS AS IN THE CASE OF FAUNTLEROY
LJ010-0014 TO COVER ENORMOUS DEFALCATIONS THE FABRICATION OF DEEDS WILLS AND FALSE SECURITIES
LJ010-0015 FOR THE PURPOSE OF MISAPPROPRIATING FUNDS OR FELONIOUSLY OBTAINING CASH
LJ010-0016 THEFTS OF BULLION BANKNOTES SPECIE AND GOLDDUST PLANNED WITH CONSUMMATE INGENUITY
LJ010-0017 ELUDING THE KEENEST VIGILANCE AND CARRIED OUT WITH RECKLESS DARING
LJ010-0018 JEWELBOXES CLEVERLY STOLEN UNDER THE VERY NOSES OF OWNERS OR CARETAKERS
LJ010-0019 AS TIME PASSED
LJ010-0020 THE EXTRAORDINARY EXTENSION OF ALL COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS LED TO MANY ENTIRELY NOVEL AND OFTEN GIGANTIC FINANCIAL FRAUDS
LJ010-0021 THE CREDULITY OF INVESTORS THE UNSCRUPULOUS DISHONESTY OF BANKERS
LJ010-0022 THE SLACKNESS OF SUPERVISION OVER WHOLLY IRRESPONSIBLE AGENTS PRODUCED MANY TERRIBLE MONETARY CATASTROPHES
LJ010-0023 AND LODGED MEN LIKE COLE ROBSON AND REDPATH IN NEWGATE
LJ010-0024 WHILE THE VARYING CONDITIONS OF SOCIAL LIFE THUS BROUGHT ABOUT MANY CHANGES IN THE CHARACTER OF OFFENSES AGAINST PROPERTY
LJ010-0025 THOSE AGAINST THE PERSON BECAME MORE AND MORE LIMITED TO THE MOST HEINOUS OR THOSE WHICH MENACED OR DESTROYED LIFE
LJ010-0026 THERE WAS NO INCREASE IN MURDER OR MANSLAUGHTER THE NUMBER OF SUCH CRIMES REMAINED PRETTY CONSTANT PROPORTIONATELY TO POPULATION
LJ010-0027 NOR DID THE METHODS BY WHICH THEY WERE PERPETRATED GREATLY VARY FROM THOSE IN TIMES PAST
LJ010-0028 THE CAUSES ALSO CONTINUED MUCH THE SAME. PASSION REVENGE CUPIDITY SUDDEN EBULLITIONS OF HOMICIDAL RAGE
LJ010-0029 THE COLDBLOODED CALCULATING ATROCITY BORN OF SELFINTEREST WERE STILL THE IRRESISTIBLE INCENTIVES TO KILL
LJ010-0030 THE BRUTAL FEROCITY OF THE WILD BEAST ONCE AROUSED THE SAME MEANS THE SAME WEAPONS WERE EMPLOYED TO DO THE DREADFUL DEED
LJ010-0031 THE SAME AND HAPPILY OFTEN FUTILE PRECAUTIONS TAKEN TO CONCEAL THE CRIME
LJ010-0032 PEGSWORTH AND GREENACRE AND DANIEL GOOD MERELY REPRODUCED TYPES THAT HAD GONE BEFORE AND THAT HAVE SINCE REAPPEARED
LJ010-0033 ESTHER HIBNER WAS AS INHUMAN IN HER ILLUSAGE OF THE PARISH APPRENTICE SHE KILLED AS MARTHA BROWNRIGG HAD BEEN
LJ010-0034 THURTELL AND HUNT FOLLOWED IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF BILLINGS WOOD AND CATHERINE HAYES
LJ010-0035 COURVOISIER MIGHT HAVE LIVED A CENTURY EARLIER
LJ010-0036 HOCKER WAS FOUND UPON THE SCENE OF HIS CRIME IRRESISTIBLY ATTRACTED THITHER AS WAS THEODORE GARDELLE
LJ010-0037 NOW AND AGAIN THERE SEEMED TO BE A RECURRENCE OF A MURDER EPIDEMIC
LJ010-0038 AS THERE HAD BEEN BEFORE AS IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE A YEAR MEMORABLE FOR THE RUSH MURDERS AT NORWICH
LJ010-0039 THE GLEESON WILSON MURDER AT LIVERPOOL THAT OF THE MANNINGS IN LONDON AND OF MANY MORE
LJ010-0040 MEN LIKE MOBBS THE MISCREANT KNOWN AS GENERAL HAYNAU ON ACCOUNT OF HIS BLOODTHIRSTINESS STILL MURDERED THEIR WIVES
LJ010-0041 OR LIKE CANNON THE CHIMNEYSWEEPER WHO SAVAGELY KILLED THE POLICEMAN
LJ010-0042 A NOT ALTOGETHER NEW CRIME HOWEVER AKIN TO MURDER
LJ010-0043 ALTHOUGH HAPPILY NEVER PASSING BEYOND DASTARDLY ATTEMPTS CROPPED UP IN THESE TIMES AND WAS OFTEN FREQUENTLY REPEATED WITHIN A SHORT INTERVAL
LJ010-0044 THE PRESENT QUEEN VERY SOON AFTER HER ACCESSION
LJ010-0045 BECAME THE VICTIM OF THE MOST COWARDLY AND UNMANLY OUTRAGES AND THE ATTEMPTED MURDER OF THE SOVEREIGN BY OXFORD IN 1840
LJ010-0046 WAS FOLLOWED IN THE VERY NEXT YEAR BY THOSE OF FRANCIS AND OF BEAN IN TWO CONSECUTIVE MONTHS
LJ010-0047 WHILE IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY HER MAJESTY WAS THE VICTIM OF ANOTHER OUTRAGE AT THE HANDS OF ONE PATE
LJ010-0048 THESE CRIMES HAD THEIR ORIGIN TOO OFTEN IN THE DISORDERED BRAINS OF LUNATICS AT LARGE LIKE CAPTAIN GOODE
LJ010-0049 THEIR PERPETRATORS WERE CHARGED WITH HIGH TREASON BUT MET WITH MERCIFUL CLEMENCY AS IRRESPONSIBLE BEINGS
LJ010-0050 BUT AT VARIOUS DATES TREASON MORE DISTINCT AND TANGIBLE CAME TO THE FRONT ATTEMPTS TO LEVY WAR AGAINST THE STATE
LJ010-0051 THE WELLKNOWN CATO STREET CONSPIRACY
LJ010-0052 WHICH GREW OUT OF DISTURBED SOCIAL CONDITIONS AFTER THE LAST FRENCH WAR AMIDST GENERAL DISTRESS
LJ010-0053 AND WHEN THE PEOPLE WERE BEGINNING TO AGITATE FOR A LARGER SHARE OF POLITICAL POWER WAS AMONG THE EARLIEST AND TO SOME EXTENT THE MOST DESPERATE OF THESE
LJ010-0054 ITS RINGLEADERS THISTLEWOOD AND THE REST WERE AFTER CAPTURE HONORED BY COMMITTAL AS STATE PRISONERS TO THE TOWER
LJ010-0055 BUT THEY CAME ONE AND ALL TO NEWGATE FOR TRIAL AT THE OLD BAILEY AND REMAINED THERE AFTER CONVICTION TILL THEY WERE HANGED
LJ010-0056 LATER ON THE CHARTISTS AGITATED PERSISTENTLY FOR THE CONCESSION EMBRACED IN THE SOCALLED PEOPLE'S CHARTER MANY OF WHICH
LJ010-0057 ARE BY THIS TIME ACTUALLY AND BY MORE LEGITIMATE EFFORTS ENGRAFTED UPON OUR CONSTITUTION
LJ010-0058 BUT THE CHARTISTS SOUGHT THEIR ENDS BY RIOT AND REBELLION AND GAINED ONLY IMPRISONMENT FOR THEIR PAINS
LJ010-0059 SOME FIVE HUNDRED IN ALL WERE ARRESTED BUT AS ONLY THREE OF THESE WERE LODGED IN NEWGATE I SHALL NOT RECUR TO THEM IN MY NARRATIVE
LJ010-0060 THE CATO STREET CONSPIRACY WOULD HAVE BEEN SIMPLY RIDICULOUS BUT FOR THE RECKLESSNESS OF THE DESPERADOES WHO PLANNED IT
LJ010-0061 THAT SOME THIRTY OR MORE NEEDY MEN SHOULD HOPE TO REVOLUTIONIZE ENGLAND IS A SUFFICIENT PROOF OF THE ABSURDITY OF THEIR ATTEMPT
LJ010-0062 BUT THEY PROCEEDED IN ALL SERIOUSNESS AND WOULD HAVE SHRUNK FROM NO OUTRAGE OR ATROCITY IN FURTHERANCE OF THEIR FOOLHARDY ENTERPRISE
LJ010-0063 THE MASSACRE OF THE WHOLE OF THE CABINET MINISTERS AT ONE STROKE WAS TO BE FOLLOWED BY AN ATTACK
LJ010-0064 UPON THE OLD MAN AND THE OLD WOMAN AS THEY STYLED THE MANSION HOUSE AND THE BANK OF ENGLAND
LJ010-0065 AT THE FORMER THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT WAS TO BE ESTABLISHED
LJ010-0066 WHICH UNDER THISTLEWOOD AS DICTATOR WAS TO RULE THE NATION BY FIRST HANDING OVER ITS CAPITAL TO FIRE AND PILLAGE
LJ010-0067 THIS THISTLEWOOD HAD SEEN MANY VICISSITUDES THROUGHOUT HIS STRANGE ADVENTUROUS CAREER. THE SON OF A RESPECTABLE LINCOLNSHIRE FARMER
LJ010-0068 HE BECAME A MILITIA OFFICER AND MARRIED A WOMAN WITH £10000 IN WHICH HOWEVER SHE HAD ONLY A LIFE INTEREST
LJ010-0069 SHE DIED EARLY AND THISTLEWOOD LEFT TO HIS OWN RESOURCES
LJ010-0070 FOLLOWED THE PROFESSION OF ARMS FIRST IN THE BRITISH SERVICE AND THEN IN THAT OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT
LJ010-0071 IT WAS DURING THIS PERIOD THAT HE WAS SAID TO HAVE IMBIBED HIS REVOLUTIONARY IDEAS
LJ010-0072 RETURNING TO ENGLAND
LJ010-0073 HE FOUND HIMSELF RICH IN A SMALL LANDED PROPERTY WHICH HE PRESENTLY SOLD TO A MAN WHO BECAME BANKRUPT BEFORE HE HAD PAID OVER THE PURCHASE MONEY
LJ010-0074 AFTER THIS HE TRIED FARMING BUT FAILED
LJ010-0075 HE MARRIED AGAIN AND CAME TO LONDON WHERE HE SOON BECAME NOTORIOUS AS A RECKLESS GAMBLER AND A POLITICIAN HOLDING THE MOST EXTREME VIEWS
LJ010-0076 IN THIS WAY HE FORMED THE ACQUAINTANCE OF WATSON AND OTHERS WITH WHOM HE WAS ARRAIGNED FOR TREASONABLE PRACTICES AND IMPRISONED
LJ010-0077 ON HIS RELEASE HE SENT A CHALLENGE TO LORD SIDMOUTH THE HOME SECRETARY AND WAS AGAIN ARRESTED AND IMPRISONED
LJ010-0078 ON HIS SECOND RELEASE GOADED BY HIS FANCIED WRONGS HE BEGAN TO PLOT A DARK AND DREADFUL REVENGE
LJ010-0079 AND THUS THE CONSPIRACY IN WHICH HE WAS THE PRIME MOVER TOOK SHAPE AND CAME TO A HEAD
LJ010-0080 THE GOVERNMENT OBTAINED EARLY AND FULL INFORMATION OF THE NEFARIOUS SCHEME
LJ010-0081 ONE OF THE CONSPIRATORS BY NAME EDWARDS
LJ010-0082 MADE A VOLUNTARY CONFESSION TO SIR HERBERT TAYLOR ONE MORNING AT WINDSOR AFTER WHICH THISTLEWOOD AND HIS ACCOMPLICES WERE CLOSELY WATCHED
LJ010-0083 AND MEASURES TAKEN TO ARREST THEM WHEN THEIR PLANS WERE SO FAR DEVELOPED THAT NO DOUBT COULD REMAIN AS TO THEIR GUILT
LJ010-0084 THE DAY APPOINTED FOR THE MURDER AND RISING ACTUALLY ARRIVED BEFORE THE AUTHORITIES INTERFERED
LJ010-0085 IT WAS THE DAY ON WHICH LORD HARROWBY WAS TO ENTERTAIN HIS COLLEAGUES AT DINNER IN GROSVENOR SQUARE
LJ010-0086 THE OCCASION WAS CONSIDERED EXCELLENT BY THE CONSPIRATORS FOR DISPOSAL OF THE WHOLE CABINET AT ONE BLOW
LJ010-0087 AND IT WAS ARRANGED THAT ONE OF THEIR NUMBER SHOULD KNOCK AT LORD HARROWBY'S DOOR ON THE PRETENSE OF LEAVING A PARCEL
LJ010-0088 AND THAT WHEN IT WAS OPENED THE WHOLE BAND SHOULD RUSH IN
LJ010-0089 WHILE A FEW SECURED THE SERVANTS THE REST WERE TO FALL UPON LORD HARROWBY AND HIS GUESTS
LJ010-0090 HANDGRENADES WERE TO BE THROWN INTO THE DININGROOM AND DURING THE NOISE AND CONFUSION THE ASSASSINATION OF THE MINISTERS WAS TO BE COMPLETED
LJ010-0091 THE HEADS OF LORD CASTLEREAGH AND LORD SIDMOUTH BEING CARRIED AWAY IN A BAG
LJ010-0092 LORD HARROWBY'S DINNERPARTY WAS POSTPONED BUT THE CONSPIRATORS KNEW NOTHING OF IT
LJ010-0093 AND THOSE WHO WATCHED HIS HOUSE WERE FURTHER ENCOURAGED IN THEIR MISTAKE BY THE ARRIVAL OF MANY CARRIAGES
LJ010-0094 BOUND AS IT HAPPENED TO THE ARCHBISHOP OF YORK'S
LJ010-0095 MEANWHILE THE MAIN BODY REMAINED AT THEIR HEADQUARTERS A RUINED STABLE IN CATO STREET
LJ010-0096 EDGEWARE ROAD COMPLETING THEIR DISPOSITIONS FOR ASSUMING SUPREME POWER AFTER THE BLOW HAD BEEN STRUCK
LJ010-0097 HERE THEY WERE SURPRISED BY THE POLICE HEADED BY A MAGISTRATE AND SUPPORTED BY A STRONG DETACHMENT OF HER MAJESTY'S GUARDS
LJ010-0098 THE POLICE WERE THE FIRST TO ARRIVE ON THE SPOT THE GUARDS HAVING ENTERED THE STREET AT THE WRONG END
LJ010-0099 THE CONSPIRATORS WERE IN A LOFT APPROACHED BY A LADDER AND A TRAPDOOR ACCESS THROUGH WHICH COULD ONLY BE OBTAINED ONE BY ONE
LJ010-0100 THE FIRST CONSTABLE WHO ENTERED THISTLEWOOD RAN THROUGH THE BODY WITH A SWORD BUT OTHERS QUICKLY FOLLOWED
LJ010-0101 THE LIGHTS WERE EXTINGUISHED AND A DESPERATE CONFLICT ENSUED
LJ010-0102 THE GUARDS HEADED BY LORD ADOLPHUS FITZ CLARENCE NOW REINFORCED THE POLICE AND THE CONSPIRATORS GAVE WAY
LJ010-0103 NINE OF THE LATTER WERE CAPTURED WITH ALL THE WAR MATERIAL CUTLASSES PISTOLS HANDGRENADES AND AMMUNITION
LJ010-0104 THISTLEWOOD AND FOURTEEN MORE SUCCEEDED FOR THE MOMENT IN MAKING THEIR ESCAPE BUT MOST OF THEM WERE SUBSEQUENTLY TAKEN
LJ010-0105 THISTLEWOOD WAS DISCOVERED NEXT MORNING IN A MEAN HOUSE IN WHITE STREET MOORFIELDS
LJ010-0106 HE WAS IN BED WITH HIS BREECHES ON IN THE POCKETS OF WHICH WERE FOUND A NUMBER OF CARTRIDGES THE BLACK BELT HE HAD WORN AT CATO STREET
LJ010-0107 AND A MILITARY SASH
LJ010-0108 THE TRIAL OF THE CONSPIRATORS CAME ON SOME SIX WEEKS LATER AT THE OLD BAILEY
LJ010-0109 THISTLEWOOD MADE A LONG AND RAMBLING DEFENSE THE CHIEF FEATURES OF WHICH WERE ABUSE OF LORD SIDMOUTH AND THE VILIFICATION OF THE INFORMER EDWARDS
LJ010-0110 SEVERAL OF THE OTHER PRISONERS TOOK THE SAME LINE AS REGARDS EDWARDS
LJ010-0111 AND THERE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN GOOD REASON FOR SUPPOSING THAT HE WAS A GREATER VILLAIN THAN ANY OF THOSE ARRAIGNED
LJ010-0112 HE HAD BEEN IN A STATE OF ABJECT MISERY AND WHEN HE FIRST JOINED THE REFORMERS AS THE CATO STREET CONSPIRATORS CALLED THEMSELVES
LJ010-0113 HE HAD NEITHER A BED TO LIE UPON NOR A COAT TO HIS BACK
LJ010-0114 HIS SUDDEN ACCESS TO MEANS UNLIMITED WAS NO DOUBT DUE TO THE PROFITABLE ROLE HE SOON ADOPTED OF GOVERNMENT INFORMER AND SPY
LJ010-0115 AND IT IS PRETTY CERTAIN THAT FOR SOME TIME HE SERVED BOTH SIDES
LJ010-0116 ON THE ONE INVEIGLING SILLY ENTHUSIASTS TO JOIN IN THE PLOT AND DENOUNCING THEM ON THE OTHER
LJ010-0117 THE EMPLOYMENT OF EDWARDS AND THE MANNER IN WHICH THE CONSPIRATORS WERE ALLOWED TO COMMIT THEMSELVES FURTHER AND FURTHER BEFORE THE LAW WAS SET IN MOTION AGAINST THEM
LJ010-0118 WERE NOT ALTOGETHER CREDITABLE TO THE GOVERNMENT
LJ010-0119 IT WAS ASSERTED NOT WITHOUT FOUNDATION AT THESE TRIALS THAT EDWARDS REPEATEDLY INCITED THE ASSOCIATES HE WAS BETRAYING
LJ010-0120 TO COMMIT OUTRAGE TO SET FIRE TO HOUSES THROW HANDGRENADES INTO THE CARRIAGES OF MINISTERS
LJ010-0121 THAT HE WAS TO USE THISTLEWOOD'S WORDS A CONTRIVER INSTIGATOR AND ENTRAPPER
LJ010-0122 THE GOVERNMENT WERE PROBABLY NOT PROUD OF THEIR AGENT FOR EDWARDS AFTER THE CONVICTION HAD BEEN ASSURED WENT ABROAD TO ENJOY IT WAS SAID
LJ010-0123 AN AMPLE PENSION SO LONG AS HE DID NOT RETURN TO ENGLAND
LJ010-0124 FIVE OF THE CONSPIRATORS THISTLEWOOD INGS BRUNT DAVIDSON AND TIDD WERE SENTENCED TO DEATH
LJ010-0125 AND SUFFERED IN THE USUAL WAY IN FRONT OF NEWGATE WITH THE ADDITIONAL PENALTY OF DECAPITATION AS TRAITORS AFTER THEY HAD BEEN HANGED
LJ010-0126 A CROWD AS GREAT AS ANY KNOWN COLLECTED IN THE OLD BAILEY TO SEE THE CEREMONY ABOUT WHICH THERE WERE SOME PECULIAR FEATURES WORTH RECORDING
LJ010-0127 THE RECKLESS DEMEANOR OF ALL THE CONVICTS EXCEPT DAVIDSON WAS MOST MARKED. THISTLEWOOD AND INGS SUCKED ORANGES ON THE SCAFFOLD
LJ010-0128 THEY WITH BRUNT AND TIDD SCORNED THE ORDINARY'S MINISTRATIONS
LJ010-0129 BUT INGS SAID HE HOPED GOD WOULD BE MORE MERCIFUL TO HIM THAN MEN HAD BEEN
LJ010-0130 INGS WAS ESPECIALLY DEFIANT. HE SOUGHT TO CHEER DAVIDSON WHO SEEMED AFFECTED CRYING OUT
LJ010-0131 COME OLD COCKOFWAX IT WILL SOON BE OVER
LJ010-0132 AS THE EXECUTIONER FASTENED THE NOOSE HE NODDED TO A FRIEND HE SAW IN THE CROWD
LJ010-0133 AND CATCHING SIGHT OF THE COFFINS RANGED AROUND THE GALLOWS HE SMILED AT THE SHOW WITH CONTEMPTUOUS INDIFFERENCE
LJ010-0134 HE ROARED OUT SNATCHES OF A SONG ABOUT DEATH OR LIBERTY AND JUST BEFORE HE WAS TURNED OFF
LJ010-0135 YELLED OUT THREE CHEERS TO THE POPULACE WHOM HE FACED
LJ010-0136 HE TOLD THE EXECUTIONER TO DO IT TIDY TO PULL IT TIGHT AND WAS IN A STATE OF HYSTERICAL EXALTATION UP TO THE VERY LAST
LJ010-0137 DAVIDSON WHO WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO SEEMED TO REALIZE HIS AWFUL SITUATION LISTENED PATIENTLY AND WITH THANKFULNESS TO THE CHAPLAIN
LJ010-0138 AND DIED IN A MANNER STRONGLY CONTRASTING WITH THAT OF HIS FELLOWS
LJ010-0139 AFTER THE FIVE BODIES HAD HUNG FOR HALFANHOUR A MAN IN A MASK CAME FORWARD TO COMPLETE THE SENTENCE
LJ010-0140 CONTEMPORARY REPORTS STATE THAT FROM THE SKILLFUL MANNER IN WHICH HE PERFORMED THE DECAPITATION
LJ010-0141 HE WAS GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE A SURGEON
LJ010-0142 BE THIS AS IT MAY THE WEAPON USED WAS ONLY AN ORDINARY AXE WHICH RATHER INDICATES THAT FORCE NOT SKILL WAS EMPLOYED
LJ010-0143 THIS AXE IS STILL IN EXISTENCE AND IS PRESERVED AT NEWGATE WITH VARIOUS OTHER UNPLEASANT CURIOSITIES
LJ010-0144 BUT IS ONLY AN ORDINARY COMMONPLACE TOOL
LJ010-0145 THESE WERE THE LAST EXECUTIONS FOR HIGH TREASON BUT NOT THE LAST PRISONERS BY MANY WHO PASSED THROUGH NEWGATE CHARGED WITH SEDITION
LJ010-0146 ATTACKS UPON THE SOVEREIGN AS I HAVE SAID BECAME MORE COMMON AFTER THE ACCESSION OF THE YOUNG QUEEN VICTORIA IN 1838
LJ010-0147 IT WAS A FORM OF HIGH TREASON NOT UNKNOWN IN EARLIER REIGNS. IN 1786 A MAD WOMAN MARGARET NICHOLSON
LJ010-0148 TRIED TO STAB GEORGE III. AS HE WAS ALIGHTING FROM HIS CARRIAGE AT THE GATE OF ST. JAMES'S PALACE
LJ010-0149 SHE WAS SEIZED BEFORE SHE COULD DO ANY MISCHIEF
LJ010-0150 AND EVENTUALLY LODGED IN BETHLEHEM HOSPITAL WHERE SHE DIED AFTER FORTY YEARS' DETENTION AT THE ADVANCED AGE OF ONE HUNDRED
LJ010-0151 AGAIN A SOLDIER BY NAME HATFIELD WHO HAD BEEN WOUNDED IN THE HEAD AND DISCHARGED FROM THE ARMY FOR UNSOUNDNESS OF MIND
LJ010-0152 FIRED A PISTOL AT GEORGE III. FROM THE PIT OF DRURY LANE THEATRE IN 1800
LJ010-0153 WILLIAM IV. WAS ALSO THE VICTIM OF A MURDEROUS OUTRAGE ON ASCOT RACECOURSE IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO
LJ010-0154 WHEN JOHN COLLINS A PERSON IN THE GARB OF A SAILOR OF WRETCHED APPEARANCE AND HAVING A WOODEN LEG
LJ010-0155 THREW A STONE AT THE KING WHICH HIT HIM ON THE FOREHEAD BUT DID NO SERIOUS INJURY
LJ010-0156 COLLINS WHEN CHARGED PLEADED THAT HE HAD LOST HIS LEG IN ACTION THAT HE HAD PETITIONED WITHOUT SUCCESS FOR A PENSION
LJ010-0157 AND THAT AS HE WAS STARVING HE HAD RESOLVED ON THIS DESPERATE DEED
LJ010-0158 FEELING AS HE SAID THAT HE MIGHT AS WELL BE SHOT OR HANGED AS REMAIN IN SUCH A STATE
LJ010-0159 HE WAS EVENTUALLY SENTENCED TO DEATH BUT THE PLEA OF LUNACY WAS ALLOWED AND HE WAS CONFINED FOR LIFE
LJ010-0160 NONE OF THE FOREGOING ATTEMPTS WERE HOWEVER SO DASTARDLY OR DETERMINED AS THAT MADE BY OXFORD UPON OUR PRESENT GRACIOUS QUEEN
LJ010-0161 TWO YEARS AFTER SHE ASCENDED THE THRONE
LJ010-0162 THE COWARDLY CRIME WAS PROBABLY ENCOURAGED BY THE FEARLESS AND CONFIDING MANNER IN WHICH THE QUEEN
LJ010-0163 SECURE AS IT SEEMED IN THE AFFECTIONS OF HER LOYAL PEOPLE FREELY APPEARED IN PUBLIC
LJ010-0164 OXFORD WHO WAS ONLY NINETEEN AT THE TIME HIS OFFENSE WAS COMMITTED HAD BEEN BORN AT BIRMINGHAM
LJ010-0165 BUT HE CAME AS A LAD TO LONDON AND TOOK SERVICE AS A POTBOY TO A PUBLICAN
LJ010-0166 FROM THIS HE WAS PROMOTED TO BARMAN AND AS SUCH HAD CHARGE OF THE BUSINESS IN VARIOUS PUBLICHOUSES
LJ010-0167 HE LEFT HIS LAST SITUATION IN APRIL 1840 AND ESTABLISHED HIMSELF IN LODGINGS IN LAMBETH
LJ010-0168 AFTER WHICH HE DEVOTED HIMSELF TO PISTOL PRACTICE IN SHOOTINGGALLERIES SOMETIMES IN LEICESTER SQUARE
LJ010-0169 SOMETIMES IN THE STRAND OR THE WEST END
LJ010-0170 HIS ACQUAINTANCES OFTEN ASKED HIS OBJECT IN THIS BUT HE KEPT HIS OWN COUNSEL TILL THE 10TH JUNE
LJ010-0171 ON THAT DAY OXFORD WAS ON THE WATCH AT BUCKINGHAM PALACE
LJ010-0172 HE SAW PRINCE ALBERT RETURN THERE FROM A VISIT TO WOOLWICH AND THEN PASSED ON TO CONSTITUTION HILL
LJ010-0173 WHERE HE WAITED TILL FOUR P.M. THE TIME AT WHICH THE QUEEN AND PRINCE CONSORT USUALLY TOOK AN AFTERNOON DRIVE
LJ010-0174 ABOUT SIX P.M. THE ROYAL CARRIAGE A LOW OPEN VEHICLE DRAWN BY FOUR HORSES RIDDEN BY POSTILIONS LEFT THE PALACE
LJ010-0175 OXFORD WHO HAD BEEN PACING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS WITH HIS HANDS UNDER THE LAPELS OF HIS COAT SAW THE CARRIAGE APPROACH
LJ010-0176 HE WAS ON THE RIGHT OR NORTH SIDE OF THE ROAD. PRINCE ALBERT OCCUPIED THE SAME SIDE OF THE CARRIAGE THE QUEEN THE LEFT
LJ010-0177 AS THE CARRIAGE CAME UP TO HIM OXFORD TURNED PUT HIS HAND INTO HIS BREAST DREW A PISTOL AND FIRED AT THE QUEEN
LJ010-0178 THE SHOT MISSED AND AS THE CARRIAGE PASSED ON OXFORD DREW A SECOND PISTOL AND FIRED AGAIN
LJ010-0179 THE QUEEN SAW THIS SECOND MOVEMENT AND STOOPED TO AVOID THE SHOT
LJ010-0180 THE PRINCE TOO ROSE TO SHIELD HER WITH HIS PERSON. AGAIN PROVIDENTIALLY THE BULLET WENT WIDE OF THE MARK
LJ010-0181 AND THE ROYAL PARTY DROVE BACK TO CLARENCE HOUSE THE QUEEN BEING ANXIOUS TO GIVE THE FIRST NEWS OF THE OUTRAGE AND OF HER SAFETY TO HER MOTHER
LJ010-0182 THE DUCHESS OF KENT
LJ010-0183 MEANWHILE THE PISTOLSHOTS HAD ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF THE BYSTANDERS OF WHOM THERE WAS A FAIR COLLECTION AS USUAL WAITING TO SEE THE QUEEN PASS
LJ010-0184 OXFORD WAS SEIZED BY A PERSON NAMED LOWE WHO WAS AT FIRST MISTAKEN FOR THE ASSAILANT
LJ010-0185 BUT OXFORD AT ONCE ASSUMED THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS CRIME SAYING IT WAS I. I DID IT. I'LL GIVE MYSELF UP
LJ010-0186 THERE IS NO OCCASION TO USE VIOLENCE. I WILL GO WITH YOU
LJ010-0187 HE WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY AND REMOVED FIRST TO A POLICE CELL THENCE COMMITTED TO NEWGATE AFTER HE HAD BEEN EXAMINED BEFORE THE PRIVY COUNCIL
LJ010-0188 OXFORD EXPRESSED LITTLE ANXIETY OR CONCERN
LJ010-0189 HE ASKED MORE THAN ONCE WHETHER THE QUEEN WAS HURT AND ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE PISTOLS WERE LOADED WITH BALL
LJ010-0190 A CRAZE FOR NOTORIETY TO BE ACHIEVED AT ANY COST WAS THE ONE ABSORBING IDEA IN YOUNG OXFORD'S DISORDERED BRAIN
LJ010-0191 AFTER HIS ARREST HE THOUGHT ONLY OF THE EXCITEMENT HIS ATTEMPT HAD RAISED NOTHING OF ITS ATROCITY
LJ010-0192 OR OF THE FATAL CONSEQUENCES WHICH MIGHT HAVE ENSUED
LJ010-0193 WHEN BROUGHT TO TRIAL HE HARDLY REALIZED HIS POSITION
LJ010-0194 BUT GAZED WITH COMPLACENCY AROUND THE CROWDED COURT AND EAGERLY INQUIRED WHAT PERSONS OF DISTINCTION WERE PRESENT
LJ010-0195 HE SMILED CONTINUALLY AND WHEN THE INDICTMENT WAS READ BURST INTO LOUD AND DISCORDANT FITS OF LAUGHTER
LJ010-0196 THESE ANTICS MAY HAVE BEEN ASSUMED TO BEAR OUT THE PLEA OF INSANITY SET UP IN HIS DEFENSE
LJ010-0197 BUT THAT THERE WAS MADNESS IN HIS FAMILY AND THAT HE HIMSELF WAS OF UNSOUND MIND COULD NOT BE WELL DENIED
LJ010-0198 HIS FATHER IT WAS PROVED IN EVIDENCE HAD BEEN AT TIMES QUITE MAD AND OXFORD'S MENTAL STATE MIGHT BE INFERRED FROM HIS OWN PROCEEDINGS
LJ010-0199 AMONG HIS PAPERS WAS FOUND A CURIOUS DOCUMENT PURPORTING TO BE THE RULES OF AN ASSOCIATION CALLED
LJ010-0200 YOUNG ENGLAND WHICH OXFORD HAD EVOLVED OUT OF HIS OWN INFLATED SELFCONCEIT AND WHICH HAD NEVER ANY REAL CORPOREAL EXISTENCE
LJ010-0201 YOUNG ENGLAND WAS A SECRET SOCIETY WITH NO AIM OR OBJECT
LJ010-0202 ITS SWORN MEMBERS KNOWN ONLY TO OXFORD AND ALL OF THEM MERE SHADOWS
LJ010-0203 WERE BOUND TO PROVIDE THEMSELVES WITH SWORD RIFLE DAGGER AND A PAIR OF PISTOLS
LJ010-0204 TO WEAR A BLACK CRAPE MASK TO OBEY PUNCTUALLY THE ORDERS OF THEIR COMMANDERINCHIEF
LJ010-0205 AND TO ASSUME ANY DISGUISE IF REQUIRED TO GO INTO THE COUNTRY ON THE BUSINESS OF THE ASSOCIATION
LJ010-0206 THE OFFICERS OF THE SOCIETY WERE TO BE KNOWN ONLY BY FACTITIOUS NAMES
LJ010-0207 THUS AMONG THE PRESIDENTS WERE THOSE OF GOWRIE JUSTINIAN ALOMAN COLSMAN KENNETH AND GODFREY
LJ010-0208 HANNIBAL AND ETHELRED WERE ON THE COUNCIL ANTHONY AUGUSTUS AND FREDERIC WERE AMONG THE GENERALS
LJ010-0209 LOUIS AND AMADEUS AMONG THE CAPTAINS AND HERCULES NEPTUNE AND MARS AMONG THE LIEUTENANTS OF THE ASSOCIATION
LJ010-0210 THE VARIOUS GRADES WERE DISTINGUISHED BY COCKADES AND BOWS OF DIFFERENT COLORS
LJ010-0211 THE SOCIETY WAS SUPPOSED TO MEET REGULARLY AND ITS PROCEEDINGS TOGETHER WITH THE SPEECHES MADE WERE DULY RECORDED
LJ010-0212 WITH OXFORD'S OTHER PAPERS WERE FOUND LETTERS FROM THE SECRETARY WRITTEN AS IT SEEMED BY OXFORD TO HIMSELF AFTER THE MANNER OF MR. TOOTS
LJ010-0213 ALL OF WHICH DECLARED THEIR APPROVAL OF THE COMMANDERINCHIEF
LJ010-0214 ONE EXPRESSED PLEASURE THAT OXFORD IMPROVED SO MUCH IN SPEAKING AND DECLARED THAT HIS OXFORD'S SPEECH THE LAST TIME WAS BEAUTIFUL
LJ010-0215 THIS LETTER WENT ON TO SAY THAT A NEW MEMBER HAD BEEN INTRODUCED BY LT. MARS A FINE TALL GENTLEMANLY YOUNG MAN
LJ010-0216 AND IT IS SAID THAT HE IS A MILITARY OFFICER BUT HIS NAME HAS NOT YET TRANSPIRED
LJ010-0217 SOON AFTER HE WAS INTRODUCED WE WERE ALARMED BY A VIOLENT KNOCKING AT THE DOOR
LJ010-0218 IN AN INSTANT OUR FACES WERE COVERED WE COCKED OUR PISTOLS AND WITH DRAWN SWORDS STOOD WAITING TO RECEIVE THE ENEMY
LJ010-0219 WHILE ONE STOOD OVER THE FIRE WITH THE PAPERS ANOTHER STOOD WITH LIGHTED TORCH TO FIRE THE HOUSE
LJ010-0220 WE THEN SENT THE OLD WOMAN TO OPEN THE DOOR AND IT PROVED TO BE SOME LITTLE BOYS WHO HAD KNOCKED AND RAN AWAY
LJ010-0221 ANOTHER LETTER DIRECTED OXFORD TO ATTEND AN EXTRAORDINARY MEETING OF YOUNG ENGLAND
LJ010-0222 IN CONSEQUENCE OF HAVING RECEIVED SOME INFORMATION OF AN IMPORTANT NATURE FROM HANOVER
LJ010-0223 YOU MUST ATTEND AND IF YOUR MASTER WILL NOT GIVE YOU LEAVE YOU MUST COME IN DEFIANCE OF HIM
LJ010-0224 NO SERIOUS IMPORTANCE COULD BE ATTACHED TO THESE THE MANIFEST INVENTIONS OF A DISORDERED INTELLECT
LJ010-0225 THE WHOLE OF THE EVIDENCE POINTED SO STRONGLY TOWARDS INSANITY THAT THE JURY BROUGHT IN A VERDICT OF ACQUITTAL ON THAT GROUND
LJ010-0226 AND OXFORD WAS ORDERED TO BE DETAINED DURING HER MAJESTY'S PLEASURE
LJ010-0227 HE WENT FROM NEWGATE FIRST TO BETHLEHEM FROM WHICH HE WAS REMOVED TO BROADMOOR ON THE OPENING OF THE GREAT CRIMINAL LUNATIC ASYLUM AT THAT PLACE
LJ010-0228 HE WAS RELEASED FROM BROADMOOR IN 1878 AND WENT ABROAD
LJ010-0229 WITHIN A COUPLE OF YEARS A SECOND ATTEMPT TO ASSASSINATE THE QUEEN WAS PERPETRATED IN NEARLY THE SAME SPOT BY A MAN NAMED JOHN FRANCIS
LJ010-0230 WHO WAS ARRESTED IN THE VERY ACT JUST AS HE HAD FIRED ONE SHOT
LJ010-0231 HIS MOTIVES FOR THUS IMITATING THE DASTARDLY CRIME OF OXFORD ARE SHROUDED IN OBSCURITY
LJ010-0232 HE COULD NOT PLEAD INSANITY LIKE HIS PREDECESSOR AND NO ATTEMPT WAS MADE AT HIS TRIAL TO PROVE HIM OF UNSOUND MIND
LJ010-0233 HERE AGAIN PROBABLY IT WAS PARTLY THE LOVE OF NOTORIETY WHICH WAS THE INCENTIVE
LJ010-0234 BACKED POSSIBLY WITH THE HOPE THAT AS IN A MUCH MORE RECENT CASE
LJ010-0235 HE WOULD BE IN SOME WAY PROVIDED FOR HE HAVING BEEN FOR SOME TIME PREVIOUSLY IN ABJECT CIRCUMSTANCES
LJ010-0236 THE DEED WAS LONG PREMEDITATED AND WOULD HAVE BEEN EXECUTED A DAY EARLIER HAD NOT HIS COURAGE FAILED HIM AT THE LAST MOMENT
LJ010-0237 A YOUTH NAMED PEARSON HAD SEEN HIM PRESENT A PISTOL AT THE QUEEN'S CARRIAGE
LJ010-0238 BUT DRAW IT BACK AGAIN EXCLAIMING PRESENTLY I WISH I HAD DONE IT
LJ010-0239 PEARSON WEAKLY ALLOWED FRANCIS TO GO OFF WITHOUT SECURING HIS APPREHENSION BUT LATER HE GAVE FULL INFORMATION
LJ010-0240 THE QUEEN WAS APPRISED OF THE DANGER AND BEGGED NOT TO GO ABROAD
LJ010-0241 BUT SHE DECLARED SHE WOULD NOT REMAIN A PRISONER IN HER OWN PALACE AND NEXT DAY DROVE OUT AS USUAL IN AN OPEN BAROUCHE
LJ010-0242 NOTHING HAPPENED TILL HER MAJESTY RETURNED TO BUCKINGHAM PALACE ABOUT SIX P.M. WHEN ON DESCENDING CONSTITUTION HILL
LJ010-0243 WITH AN EQUERRY RIDING CLOSE ON EACH SIDE OF HER CARRIAGE A MAN WHO HAD BEEN LEANING AGAINST THE PALACE GARDEN WALL SUDDENLY ADVANCED
LJ010-0244 LEVELED A PISTOL AT THE QUEEN AND FIRED. HE WAS SO CLOSE TO THE CARRIAGE THAT THE SMOKE OF HIS PISTOL ENVELOPED THE FACE OF COLONEL WYLDE
LJ010-0245 ONE OF THE EQUERRIES. THE QUEEN WAS UNTOUCHED AND AT FIRST IT IS SAID HARDLY REALIZED THE DANGER SHE HAD ESCAPED
LJ010-0246 FRANCIS HAD ALREADY BEEN SEIZED BY A POLICEMAN NAMED TROUNCE WHO SAW HIS MOVEMENT WITH THE PISTOL BUT TOO LATE TO PREVENT ITS DISCHARGE
LJ010-0247 THE PRISONER WAS CONVEYED WITHOUT DELAY TO THE HOME OFFICE AND THERE EXAMINED BY THE PRIVY COUNCIL WHICH HAD BEEN HASTILY SUMMONED FOR THE PURPOSE
LJ010-0248 ON SEARCHING HIM THE PISTOL WAS FOUND IN HIS POCKET THE BARREL STILL WARM ALSO SOME LOOSE POWDER AND A BULLET
LJ010-0249 THERE WAS SOME DOUBT AS TO WHETHER THE PISTOL WHEN FIRED WAS ACTUALLY LOADED WITH BALL BUT THE JURY BROUGHT IN A VERDICT OF GUILTY
LJ010-0250 OF THE CRIMINAL INTENT TO KILL
LJ010-0251 FRANCIS WAS SENTENCED TO BE HANGED DECAPITATED AND QUARTERED
LJ010-0252 THE OLD TRAITOR'S DOOM BUT WAS SPARED AND SUBSEQUENTLY TRANSPORTED FOR LIFE
LJ010-0253 THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE PEOPLE AT THE QUEEN'S ESCAPE WAS UPROARIOUS AND HER DRIVE NEXT DAY WAS ONE LONG TRIUMPHAL PROGRESS
LJ010-0254 AT THE ITALIAN OPERA IN THE EVENING THE AUDIENCE ON THE QUEEN'S APPEARANCE GREETED HER WITH LOUD CHEERS AND CALLED FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM
LJ010-0255 THIS WAS IN MAY EIGHTEEN FORTY TWO
LJ010-0256 UNDETERRED BY THE WELLMERITED PUNISHMENT WHICH HAD OVERTAKEN FRANCIS
LJ010-0257 A THIRD MISCREANT MADE A SIMILAR BUT FAR LESS SERIOUS ATTEMPT IN THE MONTH OF JULY FOLLOWING
LJ010-0258 AS THE QUEEN WAS DRIVING FROM BUCKINGHAM PALACE TO THE CHAPEL ROYAL
LJ010-0259 A DEFORMED LAD AMONG THE CROWD WAS SEEN TO PRESENT A PISTOL AT HER MAJESTY'S CARRIAGE
LJ010-0260 IN THE MALL ABOUT HALFWAY BETWEEN BUCKINGHAM AND ST. JAMES'S PALACES
LJ010-0261 ONLY ONE PERSON SAW THE MOVEMENT A LAD NAMED DASSET WHO AT ONCE COLLARED THE CRIPPLE AND TAKING HIM UP TO TWO POLICEMEN
LJ010-0262 CHARGED HIM WITH THE OFFENSE
LJ010-0263 THE POLICEMEN TREATED THE MATTER AS A HOAX AND ALLOWED THE CULPRIT TO MAKE OFF
LJ010-0264 LATER ON HOWEVER DASSET WAS HIMSELF SEIZED AND INTERROGATED
LJ010-0265 AND ON HIS INFORMATION HANDBILLS WERE CIRCULATED GIVING THE EXACT DESCRIPTION OF THE DEFORMED YOUTH WHO HAD A HUMPBACK
LJ010-0266 AND A LONG SICKLY PALE FACE WITH LIGHT HAIR
LJ010-0267 HIS NOSE WAS MARKED WITH A SCAR OR BLACK PATCH AND HE WAS ALTOGETHER OF A DIRTY APPEARANCE
LJ010-0268 IT HAPPENED THAT A LAD NAMED BEAN HAD ABSCONDED FROM HIS FATHER'S HOME SOME WEEKS BEFORE
LJ010-0269 WHOSE DESCRIPTION AS GIVEN BY HIS FATHER TO THE POLICE
LJ010-0270 EXACTLY TALLIED WITH THAT OF THE DEFORMED PERSON WANTED FOR THE ASSAULT ON THE QUEEN
LJ010-0271 A VISIT TO THE FATHER'S RESIDENCE WAS FOLLOWED BY THE ARREST OF THE SON WHO HAD BY THIS TIME RETURNED
LJ010-0272 THIS SON JOHN WILLIAM BEAN WAS FULLY IDENTIFIED BY DASSET AND PRESENTLY EXAMINED BY THE PRIVY COUNCIL
LJ010-0273 HE WAS EVENTUALLY CHARGED WITH A MISDEMEANOR THE CAPITAL CHARGE HAVING BEEN ABANDONED AND COMMITTED FOR TRIAL
LJ010-0274 MUCH THE SAME MOTIVES OF SEEKING NOTORIETY SEEM TO HAVE IMPELLED BEAN WHO WAS PERFECTLY SANE TO HIS RASH ACT
LJ010-0275 BUT IT WAS PROVED THAT THE PISTOL WAS NOT LOADED WITH BALL
LJ010-0276 AND HE WAS ONLY CONVICTED OF AN ATTEMPT TO HARASS VEX AND GRIEVE THE SOVEREIGN
LJ010-0277 LORD ABINGER SENTENCED HIM TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS' IMPRISONMENT IN NEWGATE
LJ010-0278 BUT THE PLACE OF DURANCE WAS CHANGED TO MEET THE EXISTING LAW TO MILLBANK PENITENTIARY
LJ010-0279 I SHALL MENTION BRIEFLY ONE MORE CASE IN WHICH HOWEVER THERE WAS NO MURDEROUS INTENT BEFORE I PASS ON TO OTHER CRIMES
LJ010-0280 ON JUNE EIGHTEEN FIFTY THE QUEEN WAS ONCE MORE SUBJECTED TO COWARDLY OUTRAGE THE OFFENDER BEING A MR. PATE A GENTLEMAN BY BIRTH
LJ010-0281 WHO HAD BORNE THE QUEEN'S COMMISSION FIRST AS CORNET AND THEN LIEUTENANT IN THE 10TH HUSSARS
LJ010-0282 PATE WAS SAID TO BE AN ECCENTRIC PERSON GIVEN TO STRANGE ACTS AND ANTICS SUCH AS MIXING WHISKEY AND CAMPHOR WITH HIS MORNING BATHWATER
LJ010-0283 AND WALKING FOR CHOICE THROUGH PRICKLY GORSE BUSHES
LJ010-0284 HE ALWAYS KEPT THE BLINDS DOWN AT HIS CHAMBERS IN JERMYN STREET AND AS THE ST. JAMES'S CLOCK CHIMED QUARTERPAST THREE
LJ010-0285 INVARIABLY WENT OUT IN A CAB FOR WHICH HE ALWAYS PAID THE SAME FARE
LJ010-0286 NINE SHILLINGS ALL IN SHILLINGS AND NO OTHER COIN
LJ010-0287 BUT THIS WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TO CONSTITUTE LUNACY NOR WAS HIS PLEA OF MOMENTARY UNCONTROLLABLE IMPULSE
LJ010-0288 DEEMED VALID AS ANY PALLIATION OF HIS OFFENSE
LJ010-0289 THAT OFFENSE WAS A BRUTAL ASSAULT UPON HER MAJESTY WHOM HE STRUCK IN THE FACE WITH A SMALL STICK JUST AS SHE WAS LEAVING CAMBRIDGE HOUSE
LJ010-0290 THE BLOW CRUSHED THE BONNET AND BRUISED THE FOREHEAD OF THE QUEEN WHO WAS HAPPILY NOT OTHERWISE INJURED
LJ010-0291 PATE WAS FOUND GUILTY AND SENTENCED TO SEVEN YEARS' TRANSPORTATION THE JUDGE BARON ALDERSON ABSTAINING FROM INFLICTING THE PENALTY OF WHIPPING
LJ010-0292 WHICH WAS AUTHORIZED BY A RECENT ACT ON ACCOUNT OF MR. PATE'S FAMILY AND POSITION IN LIFE
LJ010-0293 I HAVE ALREADY REMARKED THAT AS VIOLENCE WAS MORE AND MORE ELIMINATED FROM CRIMES AGAINST THE PERSON
LJ010-0294 FRAUDS INDICATING GREAT BOLDNESS EXTENSIVE DESIGN AND INGENUITY BECAME MORE PREVALENT
LJ010-0295 THE INCREASE OF BANK FORGERIES AND ITS CAUSE I REFERRED TO IN A PREVIOUS CHAPTER
LJ010-0296 AT ONE SESSION OF THE OLD BAILEY IN 1821 NO LESS THAN THIRTYFIVE TRUE BILLS WERE FOUND FOR PASSING FORGED NOTES
LJ010-0297 BUT THERE WERE OTHER NOTORIOUS CASES OF FORGERY
LJ010-0298 THAT OF FAUNTLEROY THE BANKER IN 1824
LJ010-0299 CAUSED MUCH EXCITEMENT AT THE TIME ON ACCOUNT OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE FRAUD AND THE SEEMING PROBITY OF THE CULPRIT
LJ010-0300 MR. FAUNTLEROY WAS A MEMBER OF A BANKING FIRM WHICH HIS FATHER HAD ESTABLISHED IN CONJUNCTION WITH A GENTLEMAN OF THE NAME OF MARSH AND OTHERS
LJ010-0301 HE HAD ENTERED THE HOUSE AS CLERK IN 1800
LJ010-0302 IN 1807 AND WHEN ONLY TWENTYTWO HE SUCCEEDED TO HIS FATHER'S SHARE IN THE BUSINESS
LJ010-0303 ACCORDING TO FAUNTLEROY'S OWN CASE HE FOUND AT ONCE THAT THE FIRM WAS HEAVILY INVOLVED
LJ010-0304 THROUGH ADVANCES MADE TO VARIOUS BUILDERS AND THAT IT COULD ONLY MAINTAIN ITS CREDIT BY WHOLESALE DISCOUNTING
LJ010-0305 ITS EMBARRASSMENTS WERE GREATLY INCREASED BY THE BANKRUPTCY OF TWO OF ITS CLIENTS IN THE BUILDING TRADE
LJ010-0306 AND THE BANK BECAME LIABLE FOR A SUM OF £170000
LJ010-0307 NEW LIABILITIES WERE INCURRED TO THE EXTENT OF £100000 BY MORE FAILURES AND IN 1819
LJ010-0308 BY THE DEATH OF ONE OF THE PARTNERS A LARGE SUM IN CASH HAD TO BE WITHDRAWN FROM THE BANK TO PAY HIS HEIRS
LJ010-0309 DURING THESE NUMEROUS AND TRYING DIFFICULTIES  IT IS MR. FAUNTLEROY WHO SPEAKS 
LJ010-0310 THE HOUSE WAS NEARLY WITHOUT RESOURCES AND THE WHOLE BURTHEN OF MANAGEMENT FALLING ON ME I SOUGHT RESOURCES WHERE I COULD
LJ010-0311 IN OTHER WORDS HE FORGED POWERS OF ATTORNEY AND PROCEEDED TO REALIZE SECURITIES LODGED IN HIS BANK UNDER VARIOUS NAMES
LJ010-0312 AMONG THE PRISONER'S PRIVATE PAPERS ONE WAS FOUND GIVING FULL DETAILS OF THE STOCK HE HAD FELONIOUSLY SOLD OUT
LJ010-0313 THE SUM TOTAL AMOUNTING TO SOME £170000 WITH A DECLARATION IN HIS OWN HANDWRITING TO THE FOLLOWING EFFECT
LJ010-0314 IN ORDER TO KEEP UP THE CREDIT OF OUR HOUSE I HAVE FORGED POWERS OF ATTORNEY FOR THE ABOVE SUMS AND PARTIES
LJ010-0315 AND SOLD OUT TO THE AMOUNT HERE STATED AND WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF MY PARTNERS
LJ010-0316 I KEPT UP THE PAYMENTS OF THE DIVIDENDS BUT MADE NO ENTRIES OF SUCH PAYMENTS IN MY BOOKS
LJ010-0317 THE BANK BEGAN FIRST TO REFUSE OUR ACCEPTANCES AND TO DESTROY THE CREDIT OF OUR HOUSE THE BANK SHALL SMART FOR IT
LJ011-0001 THE CHRONICLES OF NEWGATE VOLUME TWO BY ARTHUR GRIFFITHS SECTION FOURTEEN NEWGATE NOTORIETIES PART ONE
LJ011-0002 MANY STORIES WERE IN CIRCULATION AT THE TIME OF FAUNTLEROY'S TRIAL WITH REGARD TO HIS FORGERIES. IT WAS SAID THAT HE HAD BY MEANS OF THEM
LJ011-0003 SOLD OUT SO LARGE AN AMOUNT OF STOCK THAT HE PAID £16000 A YEAR IN DIVIDENDS TO ESCAPE DETECTION
LJ011-0004 ONCE HE RAN A NARROW RISK OF BEING FOUND OUT
LJ011-0005 A LADY IN THE COUNTRY WHO HAD £13000 IN THE STOCKS DESIRED HER LONDON AGENT TO SELL THEM OUT
LJ011-0006 HE WENT TO THE BANK AND FOUND THAT NO STOCKS STOOD IN HER NAME HE CALLED AT ONCE UPON FAUNTLEROY HIS CLIENT'S BANKERS FOR AN EXPLANATION
LJ011-0007 AND WAS TOLD BY MR. FAUNTLEROY THAT THE LADY HAD DESIRED HIM TO SELL OUT WHICH I HAVE DONE ADDED THE FRAUDULENT BANKER AND HERE ARE THE PROCEEDS
LJ011-0008 WHEREUPON HE PRODUCED EXCHEQUER BILLS TO THE AMOUNT
LJ011-0009 NOTHING MORE WAS HEARD OF THE AFFAIR ALTHOUGH THE LADY DECLARED THAT SHE HAD NEVER INSTRUCTED FAUNTLEROY TO SELL
LJ011-0010 ON ANOTHER OCCASION THE BANKER FORGED A GENTLEMAN'S NAME WHILE THE LATTER WAS SITTING WITH HIM IN HIS PRIVATE ROOM
LJ011-0011 AND TOOK THE INSTRUMENT OUT TO A CLERK WITH THE INK NOT DRY
LJ011-0012 IT MUST BE ADDED THAT THE BANK OF ENGLAND ON DISCOVERING THE FORGERIES
LJ011-0013 REPLACED THE STOCK IN THE NAMES OF THE ORIGINAL HOLDERS WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY RUINED
LJ011-0014 A NEWSPAPER REPORT OF THE TIME DESCRIBES FAUNTLEROY AS A WELLMADE MAN OF MIDDLE STATURE
LJ011-0015 HIS HAIR THOUGH GRAY WAS THICK AND LAY SMOOTH OVER HIS FOREHEAD
LJ011-0016 HIS COUNTENANCE HAD AN EXPRESSION OF MOST SUBDUED RESIGNATION
LJ011-0017 THE IMPRESSION WHICH HIS APPEARANCE ALTOGETHER WAS CALCULATED TO MAKE WAS THAT OF THE PROFOUNDEST COMMISERATION
LJ011-0018 THE CRIME LONG CARRIED ON WITHOUT DETECTION WAS FIRST DISCOVERED IN 1820
LJ011-0019 WHEN IT WAS FOUND THAT A SUM OF £10000 STANDING IN THE NAME OF THREE TRUSTEES OF WHOM FAUNTLEROY WAS ONE
LJ011-0020 HAD BEEN SOLD OUT UNDER A FORGED POWER OF ATTORNEY
LJ011-0021 FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS BROUGHT OTHER SIMILAR FRAUDS TO LIGHT
LJ011-0022 AND FIXED THE WHOLE SUM MISAPPROPRIATED AT £170000 THE FIRST FORGERY DATING BACK TO EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN
LJ011-0023 A RUN UPON THE BANK IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED WHICH WAS ONLY MET BY A SUSPENSION OF PAYMENT AND THE CLOSING OF ITS DOORS
LJ011-0024 MEANWHILE PUBLIC GOSSIP WAS BUSY WITH FAUNTLEROY'S NAME
LJ011-0025 AND IT WAS OPENLY STATED IN THE PRESS AND IN CONVERSATION THAT THE PROCEEDS OF THESE FRAUDS HAD BEEN SQUANDERED IN CHAMBERING GAMBLING AND DEBAUCHERY
LJ011-0026 FAUNTLEROY WAS SCOUTED AS A LICENTIOUS LIBERTINE A DEEP AND DETERMINED GAMESTER A SPENDTHRIFT WHOSE EXTRAVAGANCE KNEW NO BOUNDS
LJ011-0027 THE VEIL WAS LIFTED FROM HIS PRIVATE LIFE AND HE WAS ACCUSED OF PERSISTENT IMMORALITY
LJ011-0028 IN HIS DEFENSE
LJ011-0029 HE SOUGHT TO REBUT THESE CHARGES WHICH INDEED WERE NEVER CLEARLY MADE OUT AND IT IS PRETTY CERTAIN THAT HIS OWN ACCOUNT OF THE CAUSES WHICH LED HIM INTO DISHONESTY
LJ011-0030 WAS SUBSTANTIALLY TRUE
LJ011-0031 HE CALLED MANY WITNESSES SEVENTEEN IN ALL TO SPEAK OF HIM AS THEY HAD FOUND HIM AND THESE ALL RESPECTABLE CITY MERCHANTS AND BUSINESS MEN
LJ011-0032 DECLARED THAT THEY HAD HITHERTO FORMED A HIGH OPINION OF HIS HONOR INTEGRITY AND GOODNESS OF DISPOSITION
LJ011-0033 DEEMING HIM THE LAST PERSON CAPABLE OF A DISHONORABLE ACTION
LJ011-0034 THESE ARGUMENTS AVAILED LITTLE WITH THE JURY WHO AFTER A SHORT DELIBERATION FOUND FAUNTLEROY GUILTY AND HE WAS SENTENCED TO DEATH
LJ011-0035 EVERY ENDEAVOR WAS USED HOWEVER TO OBTAIN A COMMUTATION OF SENTENCE. HIS CASE WAS TWICE ARGUED BEFORE THE JUDGES ON POINTS OF LAW
LJ011-0036 BUT THE RESULT IN BOTH CASES WAS UNFAVORABLE
LJ011-0037 APPEALS WERE MADE TO THE HOME SECRETARY AND ALL POSSIBLE POLITICAL INTEREST BROUGHT TO BEAR BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS
LJ011-0038 FAUNTLEROY MEANWHILE LAY IN NEWGATE NOT HERDED WITH OTHER CONDEMNED PRISONERS AS THE CUSTOM WAS
LJ011-0039 BUT IN A SEPARATE CHAMBER THAT BELONGING TO ONE OF THE WARDERS OF THE JAIL
LJ011-0040 I FIND IN THE CHAPLAIN'S JOURNAL UNDER DATE 1824 VARIOUS ENTRIES RELATIVE TO THIS PRISONER
LJ011-0041 VISITED MR. FAUNTLEROY. MY APPLICATION FOR BOOKS FOR HIM NOT HAVING BEEN ATTENDED I HAD NO PRAYERBOOK TO GIVE HIM
LJ011-0042 VISITED MR. FAUNTLEROY THE SHERIFFS HAVE VERY KINDLY PERMITTED HIM TO REMAIN IN THE TURNKEY'S ROOM WHERE HE WAS ORIGINALLY PLACED NOR CAN I OMIT EXPRESSING A HOPE
LJ011-0043 THAT THIS MAY PROVE THE BEGINNING OF A BETTER SYSTEM OF CONFINEMENT AND THAT EVERY DESCRIPTION OF PERSONS WHO MAY BE UNFORTUNATELY UNDER SENTENCE OF DEATH
LJ011-0044 WILL NO LONGER BE HERDED INDISCRIMINATELY TOGETHER
LJ011-0045 THE KINDLINESS OF THE CITY AUTHORITIES TO FAUNTLEROY WAS NOT LIMITED TO THE ASSIGNMENT OF A SEPARATE PLACE OF DURANCE
LJ011-0046 AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID THEY TOOK THE CHAPLAIN SERIOUSLY TO TASK FOR THE BAD TASTE SHOWN IN THE CONDEMNED SERMON PREACHED BEFORE FAUNTLEROY
LJ011-0047 THIS WAS ON THE TEXT
LJ011-0048 WHEREFORE LET HIM THAT THINKETH HE STANDETH TAKE HEED LEST HE FALL AND WAS FULL OF THE MOST POINTED ALLUSIONS TO THE CULPRIT
LJ011-0049 FAUNTLEROY CONSTANTLY GROANED ALOUD WHILE THE SERMON PROCEEDED AND CONTEMPORARY REPORTS DECLARED
LJ011-0050 THAT HE APPEARED TO FEEL DEEPLY THE FORCE OF THE REVEREND GENTLEMAN'S OBSERVATIONS ESPECIALLY WHEN THE CHAPLAIN SPOKE OF
LJ011-0051 THE GREAT MAGNITUDE OF OUR ERRING BROTHER'S OFFENSE ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS DESCRIPTION IN A TRADING COMMUNITY
LJ011-0052 THE SERMON ENDED WITH AN APPEAL TO THE DYING MAN EXHORTING HIM TO PENITENCE
LJ011-0053 THIS PERSONALITY AND IT CAN BE CALLED BY NO OTHER NAME IS CAREFULLY EXCLUDED FROM PRISON PULPIT UTTERANCES ON THE EVE OF AN EXECUTION
LJ011-0054 A VERY CURIOUS AND IN ITS WAY AMUSING CIRCUMSTANCE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS CASE WAS THE OFFER OF A CERTAIN ITALIAN
LJ011-0055 EDMUND ANGELINI TO TAKE FAUNTLEROY'S PLACE
LJ011-0056 ANGELINI WROTE TO THE LORD MAYOR TO THIS EFFECT
LJ011-0057 URGING THAT FAUNTLEROY WAS A FATHER A CITIZEN HIS LIFE IS USEFUL MINE A BURTHEN TO THE STATE
LJ011-0058 HE WAS SUMMONED TO THE MANSION HOUSE WHERE HE REPEATED HIS REQUEST CRYING ACCORDEZ MOI CETTE GRÂCE WITH MUCH URGENCY
LJ011-0059 THERE WERE DOUBTS OF HIS SANITY
LJ011-0060 HE WROTE AFTERWARDS TO THE EFFECT THAT THE MOMENT HE HAD OFFERED HIMSELF AN UNKNOWN ASSASSIN CAME TO AIM A BLOW AT HIM
LJ011-0061 LET THIS MONSTER GIVE HIS NAME I AM READY TO FIGHT HIM. I AM STILL DETERMINED TO PUT MYSELF IN THE PLACE OF MR. FAUNTLEROY
LJ011-0062 IF THE LAW OF THIS COUNTRY CAN RECEIVE SUCH A SACRIFICE MY DEATH WILL RENDER TO HEAVEN AN INNOCENT MAN AND TO EARTH A REPENTANT SINNER
LJ011-0063 FAUNTLEROY WAS NOT ENTIRELY DEPENDENT UPON THE ORDINARY FOR GHOSTLY COUNSEL IN HIS EXTREMITY
LJ011-0064 HE WAS ALSO ATTENDED BY THE REV MR. SPRINGETT AND THE INDEFATIGABLE MR. BAKER WHOSE NAME HAS ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED
LJ011-0065 WHEN LED OUT ON THE MORNING OF HIS EXECUTION THESE TWO LASTNAMED GENTLEMEN EACH TOOK HOLD OF ONE OF HIS ARMS AND SO ACCOMPANIED HIM TO THE SCAFFOLD
LJ011-0066 THE CONCOURSE IN FRONT OF NEWGATE WAS ENORMOUS BUT MUCH SYMPATHY WAS EVINCED FOR THIS UNFORTUNATE VICTIM TO HUMAN WEAKNESS AND RUTHLESS LAWS
LJ011-0067 A REPORT WAS MOREOVER WIDELY CIRCULATED AND THE IMPRESSION LONG PREVAILED THAT HE ACTUALLY ESCAPED DEATH
LJ011-0068 IT WAS SAID THAT STRANGULATION HAD BEEN PREVENTED BY THE INSERTION OF A SILVER TUBE IN HIS WINDPIPE
LJ011-0069 AND THAT AFTER HANGING FOR THE REGULATED TIME HE WAS TAKEN DOWN AND EASILY RESTORED TO CONSCIOUSNESS
LJ011-0070 AFTERWARDS ACCORDING TO THE COMMON RUMOR HE WENT ABROAD AND LIVED THERE FOR MANY YEARS BUT THE STORY IS NOT ONLY WHOLLY UNSUBSTANTIATED
LJ011-0071 BUT THERE IS GOOD EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT THE BODY AFTER EXECUTION WAS HANDED OVER TO HIS FRIENDS AND INTERRED PRIVATELY
LJ011-0072 SOME YEARS WERE STILL TO ELAPSE BEFORE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT CEASED TO BE THE PENALTY FOR FORGERY AND IN THE INTERVAL
LJ011-0073 SEVERAL PERSONS WERE SENTENCED TO OR SUFFERED DEATH FOR THIS CRIME
LJ011-0074 THERE WERE TWO NOTABLE CAPITAL CONVICTIONS FOR FORGERY IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY EIGHT
LJ011-0075 ONE WAS THAT OF CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY WHO ASSUMED THE ALIASES OF COLONEL WALLACE AND COLONEL MORGAN
LJ011-0076 HIS OFFENSE WAS UTTERING FORGED NOTES AND THERE WAS STRONG SUSPICION THAT HE HAD LONG SUBSISTED ENTIRELY BY THIS FRAUD
LJ011-0077 THE ACT FOR WHICH HE WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY WAS THE PAYMENT OF A FORGED TENPOUND NOTE FOR HALFADOZEN SILVER SPOONS
LJ011-0078 MONTGOMERY WAS AN ADEPT AT FORGERY HE HAD GONE WRONG EARLY ALTHOUGH BORN OF RESPECTABLE PARENTS AND GAZETTED TO A COMMISSION IN THE ARMY
LJ011-0079 HE SOON LEFT THE SERVICE AND BETOOK HIMSELF TO DISHONEST WAYS
LJ011-0080 HIS FIRST FORGERY WAS THE MARVELOUS IMITATION OF THE SIGNATURE OF THE HON. MR. NEVILLE M.P. WHO WROTE AN EXTREMELY CRAMPED AND CURIOUS HAND
LJ011-0081 HE WAS NOT PROSECUTED FOR THIS FRAUD ON ACCOUNT OF THE RESPECTABILITY OF HIS FAMILY AND SOON AFTER THIS ESCAPE
LJ011-0082 HE CAME TO LONDON WHERE HE PRACTICED AS A PROFESSIONAL SWINDLER AND CHEAT
LJ011-0083 FOR A LONG TIME JUSTICE DID NOT OVERTAKE HIM FOR ANY CRIMINAL OFFENSE BUT HE WAS FREQUENTLY IN NEWGATE AND IN THE KING'S BENCH FOR DEBT
LJ011-0084 AFTER THREE YEARS' CONFINEMENT IN THE LATTER PRISON HE PASSED HIMSELF OFF AS HIS BROTHER COLONEL MONTGOMERY
LJ011-0085 A DISTINGUISHED OFFICER AND WOULD HAVE MARRIED AN HEIRESS HAD NOT THE IMPOSTURE BEEN DISCOVERED IN TIME
LJ011-0086 HE THEN TOOK TO FORGING BANKNOTES AND WAS ARRESTED AS I HAVE DESCRIBED ABOVE
LJ011-0087 MONTGOMERY WAS DULY SENTENCED TO DEATH BUT HE PREFERRED SUICIDE TO THE GALLOWS. AFTER SENTENCE HIS DEMEANOR WAS SERIOUS YET FIRM
LJ011-0088 THE NIGHT PREVIOUS TO THAT FIXED FOR HIS EXECUTION HE WROTE SEVERAL LETTERS ONE OF THEM BEING TO EDWARD GIBBON WAKEFIELD A FELLOWPRISONER
LJ011-0089 AND LISTENED ATTENTIVELY TO THE ORDINARY WHO READ HIM THE WELLKNOWN ADDRESS WRITTEN AND DELIVERED BY DR. DODD PREVIOUS TO HIS OWN EXECUTION FOR FORGERY
LJ011-0090 BUT NEXT MORNING HE WAS FOUND DEAD IN HIS CELL
LJ011-0091 IN ONE CORNER AFTER MUCH SEARCH A PHIAL WAS FOUND LABELED PRUSSIC ACID
LJ011-0092 WHICH IT WAS ASSERTED HE HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF CARRYING ABOUT HIS PERSON EVER SINCE HE HAD TAKEN TO PASSING FORGED NOTES AS AN ANTIDOTE AGAINST DISGRACE
LJ011-0093 THIS PHIAL HE HAD MANAGED TO RETAIN IN HIS POSSESSION IN SPITE OF THE FREQUENT SEARCHES TO WHICH HE WAS SUBJECTED IN NEWGATE
LJ011-0094 THE SECOND CONVICTION FOR FORGERY IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY EIGHT WAS THAT OF THE QUAKER JOSEPH HUNTON A MAN OF PREVIOUSLY THE HIGHEST REPUTE IN THE CITY OF LONDON
LJ011-0095 HE HAD PROSPERED IN EARLY LIFE WAS A SLOPSELLER ON A LARGE SCALE AT BURY ST. EDMUNDS AND A SUGARBAKER IN THE METROPOLIS
LJ011-0096 HE MARRIED A LADY ALSO BELONGING TO THE SOCIETY OF FRIENDS WHO BROUGHT HIM A LARGE FORTUNE WHICH AND HIS OWN MONEY HE PUT INTO A CITY FIRM
LJ011-0097 THAT OF DICKSON AND CO
LJ011-0098 HE SOON HOWEVER BECAME DEEPLY INVOLVED IN STOCK EXCHANGE SPECULATIONS
LJ011-0099 AND LOSING HEAVILY TO MEET THE CLAIMS UPON HIM HE PUT OUT A NUMBER OF FORGED BILLS OF EXCHANGE OR ACCEPTANCES
LJ011-0100 TO WHICH THE SIGNATURE OF ONE WILKINS OF ABINGDON WAS FOUND TO BE FORGED
LJ011-0101 HUNTON TRIED TO FLY THE COUNTRY ON THE DETECTION OF THE FRAUD BUT WAS ARRESTED AT PLYMOUTH JUST AS HE WAS ON THE POINT OF LEAVING ENGLAND IN THE NEW YORK PACKET
LJ011-0102 HE HAD GONE ON BOARD IN HIS QUAKER DRESS BUT WHEN CAPTURED WAS FOUND IN A LIGHTGREEN FROCK
LJ011-0103 A PAIR OF LIGHT GRAY PANTALOONS A BLACK STOCK AND A FORAGING CAP
LJ011-0104 HUNTON WAS PUT UPON HIS TRIAL AT THE OLD BAILEY AND IN DUE COURSE SENTENCED TO DEATH
LJ011-0105 HIS DEFENSE WAS THAT THE FORGED ACCEPTANCES WOULD HAVE BEEN MET ON COMING TO MATURITY AND THAT HE HAD NO REAL DESIRE TO DEFRAUD
LJ011-0106 HUNTON ACCEPTED HIS SENTENCE WITH GREAT RESIGNATION ALTHOUGH HE PROTESTED AGAINST THE INHUMANITY OF THE LAWS WHICH CONDEMNED HIM TO DEATH
LJ011-0107 ON ENTERING NEWGATE HE SAID
LJ011-0108 I WISH AFTER THIS DAY TO HAVE COMMUNICATION WITH NOBODY LET ME TAKE LEAVE OF MY WIFE AND FAMILY AND FRIENDS. I HAVE ALREADY SUFFERED AN EXECUTION
LJ011-0109 MY HEART HAS UNDERGONE THAT HORRIBLE PENALTY
LJ011-0110 HE WAS HOWEVER VISITED BY AND RECEIVED HIS WIFE AND SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE SOCIETY OF FRIENDS
LJ011-0111 TWO ELDERS OF THE MEETING SAT UP WITH HIM IN THE PRESS YARD THE WHOLE OF THE NIGHT PREVIOUS TO EXECUTION AND A THIRD
LJ011-0112 MR. SPARKS MOLINE CAME TO ATTEND HIM TO THE SCAFFOLD
LJ011-0113 HE MET HIS DEATH WITH UNSHAKEN FIRMNESS ONLY ENTREATING THAT A CERTAIN BLUE HANDKERCHIEF
LJ011-0114 TO WHICH HE SEEMED FONDLY ATTACHED SHOULD BE USED TO BANDAGE HIS EYES WHICH REQUEST WAS READILY GRANTED
LJ011-0115 HUNTON'S EXECUTION NO DOUBT AROUSED PUBLIC ATTENTION TO THE CRUELTY AND FUTILITY OF THE CAPITAL LAW AGAINST FORGERY
LJ011-0116 A SOCIETY WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN STARTED AGAINST CAPITAL PUNISHMENT
LJ011-0117 DEVOTED ITS EFFORTS FIRST TO A MITIGATION OF THE FORGERY STATUTE BUT COULD NOT IMMEDIATELY ACCOMPLISH MUCH
LJ011-0118 IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINE THE GALLOWS CLAIMED TWO MORE VICTIMS FOR THIS OFFENSE
LJ011-0119 ONE WAS RICHARD GIFFORD A WELLEDUCATED YOUTH WHO HAD BEEN AT CHRIST'S HOSPITAL AND AFTERWARDS IN THE NATIONAL DEBT OFFICE
LJ011-0120 UNFORTUNATELY HE TOOK TO DRINK LOST HIS APPOINTMENT AND FELL FROM BAD TO WORSE
LJ011-0121 SUDDENLY AFTER BEING AT THE LOWEST DEPTHS HE EMERGED AND WAS FOUND BY HIS FRIENDS LIVING IN COMFORT IN THE WATERLOO ROAD
LJ011-0122 HIS FUNDS WHICH HE PRETENDED CAME TO HIM WITH A RICH WIFE WERE REALLY THE PROCEEDS OF FRAUDS UPON THE BANK OF ENGLAND
LJ011-0123 HE FORGED THE NAMES OF PEOPLE WHO HELD STOCK ON THE BANK BOOKS AND GOT THE VALUE OF THE STOCK
LJ011-0124 HE ALSO FORGED DIVIDEND RECEIPTS AND GOT THE DIVIDENDS. HE WAS ONLY SIXANDTWENTY WHEN HE WAS HANGED
LJ011-0125 THE OTHER AND THE LAST CRIMINAL EXECUTED FOR FORGERY IN THIS COUNTRY WAS ONE MAYNARD WHO WAS CONVICTED OF A FRAUD UPON THE CUSTOM HOUSE
LJ011-0126 IN CONJUNCTION WITH TWO OTHERS ONE OF WHOM WAS A CLERK IN THE CUSTOM HOUSE
LJ011-0127 AND HAD ACCESS TO THE OFFICIAL RECORDS HE FORGED A WARRANT FOR ONE THOUSAND NINEHUNDRED SEVENTYTHREE POUNDS AND WAS PAID THE MONEY BY THE COMPTROLLER GENERAL
LJ011-0128 MAYNARD WAS CONVICTED OF UTTERING THE FORGED DOCUMENT JONES OF BEING AN ACCESSORY THE THIRD PRISONER WAS ACQUITTED
LJ011-0129 MAYNARD WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO SUFFERED DEATH
LJ011-0130 THIS WAS ON THE LAST DAY OF EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINE IN THE FOLLOWING SESSION SIR ROBERT PEEL BROUGHT IN A BILL TO CONSOLIDATE THE ACTS RELATING TO FORGERY
LJ011-0131 UPON THE THIRD READING OF THIS BILL SIR JAMES MACINTOSH MOVED AS AN AMENDMENT THAT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT SHOULD BE ABOLISHED FOR ALL CRIMES OF FORGERY
LJ011-0132 EXCEPT THE FORGERY OF WILLS AND POWERS OF ATTORNEY
LJ011-0133 THIS AMENDMENT WAS STRONGLY SUPPORTED OUTSIDE THE HOUSE AND A PETITION IN FAVOR OF ITS PASSING WAS PRESENTED
LJ011-0134 SIGNED BY MORE THAN A THOUSAND MEMBERS OF BANKING FIRMS
LJ011-0135 MACINTOSH'S AMENDMENT WAS CARRIED IN THE COMMONS BUT THE NEW LAW DID NOT PASS THE LORDS WHO REENACTED THE CAPITAL PENALTY
LJ011-0136 STILL NO SENTENCE OF DEATH WAS CARRIED OUT FOR THE OFFENSE AND IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO
LJ011-0137 THE ATTORNEYGENERAL INTRODUCED A BILL TO ABOLISH CAPITAL PUNISHMENT ENTIRELY FOR FORGERY
LJ011-0138 IT PASSED THE COMMONS BUT OPPOSITION WAS AGAIN ENCOUNTERED IN THE LORDS
LJ011-0139 THIS TIME THEY SENT BACK THE BILL REENACTING ONLY THE TWO PENALTIES FOR WILL FORGING AND THE FORGING OF POWERS OF ATTORNEY
LJ011-0140 IN OTHER WORDS THEY HAD ADVANCED IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO TO THE POINT AT WHICH THE LOWER HOUSE HAD ARRIVED IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY
LJ011-0141 THERE WERE AT THE MOMENT IN NEWGATE SIX CONVICTS SENTENCED TO DEATH FOR FORGING WILLS
LJ011-0142 THE QUESTION WAS WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT WOULD DARE TO TAKE THEIR LIVES AT THE BIDDING OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS
LJ011-0143 AND IN DEFIANCE OF THE VOTE OF THE ASSEMBLY WHICH MORE ACCURATELY REPRESENTED PUBLIC OPINION. IT WAS INDEED ANNOUNCED THAT THEIR FATE WAS SEALED
LJ011-0144 BUT MR. JOSEPH HUME PRESSED THE GOVERNMENT HARD AND OBTAINED AN ASSURANCE THAT THE MEN SHOULD NOT BE EXECUTED
LJ011-0145 THE NEW FORGERY ACT WITH THE LORDS' AMENDMENT PASSED INTO LAW BUT THE LATTER PROVED PERFECTLY HARMLESS
LJ011-0146 AND NO PERSON EVER AFTER SUFFERED DEATH FOR ANY VARIETY OF THIS CRIME
LJ011-0147 I WILL INCLUDE IN THIS PART OF THE PRESENT CHAPTER ALMOST ONE OF THE LAST INSTANCES OF A CRIME WHICH IN TIME PAST
LJ011-0148 HAD INVARIABLY BEEN VISITED WITH THE DEATH PENALTY AND WHICH WAS OF A DISTINCTLY FRAUDULENT NATURE
LJ011-0149 THE ABDUCTION OF MISS TURNER BY THE BROTHERS WAKEFIELD BORE A STRONG RESEMBLANCE TO THE CARRYING OFF AND FORCIBLE MARRYING OF HEIRESSES AS ALREADY DESCRIBED
LJ011-0150 MISS TURNER WAS A SCHOOLGIRL OF BARELY FIFTEEN
LJ011-0151 ONLY CHILD OF A GENTLEMAN OF LARGE PROPERTY IN CHESHIRE OF WHICH COUNTY HE WAS ACTUALLY HIGH SHERIFF AT THE TIME OF HIS DAUGHTER'S ABDUCTION
LJ011-0152 THE ELDER BROTHER
LJ011-0153 EDWARD GIBBON WAKEFIELD THE PRIME MOVER IN THE ABDUCTION WAS A BARRISTER NOT EXACTLY BRIEFLESS BUT WITHOUT A LARGE PRACTICE
LJ011-0154 HE HAD IT WAS SAID A GOOD PRIVATE INCOME AND WAS ALREADY A WIDOWER WITH TWO CHILDREN AT THE TIME OF HIS COMMITTING THE OFFENSE FOR WHICH HE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY TRIED
LJ011-0155 HE HAD ELOPED WITH HIS FIRST WIFE FROM SCHOOL
LJ011-0156 WHILE ON A VISIT TO MACCLESFIELD HE HEARD BY CHANCE OF MISS TURNER AND THAT SHE WOULD INHERIT ALL HER FATHER'S POSSESSIONS
LJ011-0157 HE THEREUPON CONCEIVED AN IDEA OF CARRYING HER OFF AND MARRYING HER WILLY NILLY AT GRETNA GREEN
LJ011-0158 THE TWO BROTHERS STARTED AT ONCE FOR LIVERPOOL WHERE MISS TURNER WAS AT SCHOOL WITH A MRS. DAULBY
LJ011-0159 AT MANCHESTER EN ROUTE A TRAVELING CARRIAGE WAS PURCHASED WHICH WAS DRIVEN UP TO MRS. DAULBY'S DOOR AT EIGHT IN THE MORNING
LJ011-0160 AND A SERVANT HURRIEDLY ALIGHTED FROM IT BEARING A LETTER FOR MISS TURNER
LJ011-0161 THIS PURPORTED TO BE FROM THE MEDICAL ATTENDANT OF MR. TURNER WRITTEN AT SHRIGLEY MR. TURNER'S PLACE OF RESIDENCE
LJ011-0162 AND IT STATED THAT MRS. TURNER HAD BEEN STRICKEN WITH PARALYSIS
LJ011-0163 SHE WAS NOT IN IMMEDIATE DANGER BUT SHE WISHED TO SEE HER DAUGHTER AS IT WAS POSSIBLE SHE MIGHT SOON BECOME INCAPABLE OF RECOGNIZING ANY ONE
LJ011-0164 MISS TURNER GREATLY AGITATED ACCOMPANIED THE MESSENGER WHO HAD BROUGHT THIS NEWS A DISGUISED SERVANT OF WAKEFIELD'S
LJ011-0165 WHO HAD PLAUSIBLY EXPLAINED THAT HE HAD ONLY RECENTLY BEEN ENGAGED AT SHRIGLEY
LJ011-0166 THE ROAD TAKEN WAS VIA MANCHESTER WHERE THE SERVANT SAID A DR. HULL WAS TO BE PICKED UP TO GO ON WITH THEM TO SHRIGLEY
LJ011-0167 AT MANCHESTER HOWEVER THE CARRIAGE STOPPED AT THE ALBION HOTEL
LJ011-0168 MISS TURNER WAS SHOWN INTO A PRIVATE ROOM WHERE MR. WAKEFIELD SOON PRESENTED HIMSELF
LJ011-0169 MISS TURNER NOT KNOWING HIM WOULD HAVE LEFT THE ROOM BUT HE SAID HE CAME FROM HER FATHER AND SHE REMAINED
LJ011-0170 WAKEFIELD IN REPLY TO HER INQUIRIES SATISFIED HER THAT HER MOTHER WAS WELL AND THAT THE REAL REASON FOR SUMMONING HER FROM SCHOOL
LJ011-0171 WAS THE STATE OF HER FATHER'S AFFAIRS
LJ011-0172 MR. TURNER WAS ON THE VERGE OF BANKRUPTCY HE WAS AT THAT MOMENT AT KENDAL AND WISHED HER TO JOIN HIM THERE AT ONCE
LJ011-0173 MISS TURNER CONSENTED TO GO ON AND THEY TRAVELED NIGHT AND DAY TOWARDS THE NORTH
LJ011-0174 BUT AT KENDAL THERE WAS NO MR. TURNER AND TO ALLAY MISS TURNER'S GROWING ANXIETY
LJ011-0175 WAKEFIELD FOUND IT NECESSARY TO BECOME MORE EXPLICIT REGARDING HER FATHER'S AFFAIRS
LJ011-0176 HE NOW PRETENDED THAT MR. TURNER WAS ALSO ON HIS WAY TO THE BORDER PURSUED BY SHERIFFS' OFFICERS
LJ011-0177 THE FACT WAS WAKEFIELD WENT ON TO SAY AN UNCLE OF HIS HAD ADVANCED MR. TURNER £60000 WHICH HAD TEMPORARILY STAVED OFF RUIN
LJ011-0178 BUT ANOTHER BANK HAD SINCE FAILED AND NOTHING COULD SAVE MR. TURNER BUT THE TRANSFER OF SOME PROPERTY TO MISS TURNER AND ITS SETTLEMENT ON HER
LJ011-0179 SO THAT IT MIGHT BECOME THE EXCLUSIVE PROPERTY OF HER HUSBAND WHOEVER HE MIGHT BE
LJ011-0180 WAKEFIELD ADDED THAT IT HAD BEEN SUGGESTED HE SHOULD MARRY MISS TURNER BUT THAT HE HAD LAUGHED AT THE IDEA
LJ011-0181 WAKEFIELD'S UNCLE TOOK THE MATTER MORE SERIOUSLY AND DECLARED THAT UNLESS THE MARRIAGE CAME OFF MR. TURNER MUST BE SOLD UP
LJ011-0182 MISS TURNER THUS PRESSED CONSENTED TO GO ON TO GRETNA GREEN
LJ011-0183 PASSING THROUGH CARLISLE SHE WAS TOLD THAT MR. TURNER WAS IN THE TOWN BUT COULD NOT SHOW HIMSELF
LJ011-0184 NOTHING COULD RELEASE HIM FROM HIS TROUBLE BUT THE ARRIVAL OF THE MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE FROM GRETNA GREEN
LJ011-0185 FILIAL AFFECTION ROSE SUPERIOR TO ALL SCRUPLES AND MISS TURNER HAVING CROSSED THE BORDER WAS MARRIED TO WAKEFIELD
LJ011-0186 BY THE BLACKSMITH IN THE USUAL WAY
LJ011-0187 RETURNING TO CARLISLE SHE NOW HEARD THAT HER FATHER HAD BEEN SET FREE AND HAD GONE HOME TO SHRIGLEY WHITHER THEY WERE TO FOLLOW HIM
LJ011-0188 THEY SET OUT BUT AT LEEDS WAKEFIELD FOUND HIMSELF CALLED SUDDENLY TO PARIS
LJ011-0189 THE OTHER BROTHER WAS ACCORDINGLY SENT ON A PRETENDED MISSION TO SHRIGLEY TO BRING MR. TURNER ON TO LONDON WHITHER WAKEFIELD AND MISS TURNER ALSO PROCEEDED
LJ011-0190 ON ARRIVAL WAKEFIELD PRETENDED THAT THEY HAD MISSED MR. TURNER AND MUST FOLLOW HIM OVER TO FRANCE
LJ011-0191 THE STRANGELYMARRIED COUPLE THEREUPON PRESSED ON TO DOVER AND CROSSED OVER TO CALAIS
LJ011-0192 THE FACT OF THE ABDUCTION DID NOT TRANSPIRE FOR SOME DAYS
LJ011-0193 THEN MRS. DAULBY LEARNT THAT MISS TURNER HAD NOT ARRIVED AT SHRIGLEY BUT THAT SHE HAD GONE TO MANCHESTER
LJ011-0194 FRIENDS WENT IN PURSUIT AND TRACED HER TO HUDDERSFIELD AND FURTHER NORTH
LJ011-0195 THE TERROR AND DISMAY OF HER PARENTS WERE SOON INTENSIFIED BY THE RECEIPT OF A LETTER FROM WAKEFIELD AT CARLISLE ANNOUNCING THE MARRIAGE
LJ011-0196 MR. TURNER AT ONCE SET OFF FOR LONDON WHERE HE SOUGHT THE ASSISTANCE OF THE POLICE
LJ011-0197 AND PRESENTLY ASCERTAINED THAT WAKEFIELD HAD GONE TO THE CONTINENT WITH HIS INVOLUNTARY BRIDE
LJ011-0198 AN UNCLE OF MISS WAKEFIELD'S ACCOMPANIED BY HIS SOLICITOR AND A BOW STREET RUNNER AT ONCE WENT IN PURSUIT
LJ011-0199 MEANWHILE A SECOND LETTER TURNED UP FROM WAKEFIELD AT CALAIS IN WHICH HE ASSURED MRS. TURNER THAT MISS TURNER WAS FONDLY ATTACHED TO HIM
LJ011-0200 AND WENT ON TO SAY I DO ASSURE YOU MADAM THAT IT SHALL BE THE ANXIOUS ENDEAVOR OF MY LIFE TO PROMOTE HER HAPPINESS BY EVERY MEANS IN MY POWER
LJ011-0201 THE GAME HOWEVER WAS NEARLY UP MISS TURNER WAS MET BY HER UNCLE ON CALAIS PIER AS SHE WAS WALKING WITH WAKEFIELD
LJ011-0202 THE UNCLE CLAIMED HER THE HUSBAND RESISTED
LJ011-0203 MONSIEUR LE MAIRE WAS APPEALED TO AND DECIDED TO LEAVE IT TO THE YOUNG LADY WHO AT ONCE ABANDONED WAKEFIELD
LJ011-0204 AS HE STILL URGED HIS RIGHTS OVER HIS WIFE MISS TURNER CRIED OUT IN PROTEST NO NO I AM NOT HIS WIFE
LJ011-0205 HE CARRIED ME AWAY BY FRAUD AND STRATAGEM AND FORCED ME TO ACCOMPANY HIM TO GRETNA GREEN
LJ011-0206 BY THE SAME FORCIBLE MEANS I WAS COMPELLED TO QUIT ENGLAND AND TO TRUST MYSELF TO THE PROTECTION OF THIS PERSON
LJ011-0207 WHOM I NEVER SAW UNTIL I WAS TAKEN FROM LIVERPOOL AND NEVER WANT TO SEE AGAIN
LJ011-0208 ON THIS WAKEFIELD GAVE IN
LJ011-0209 HE SURRENDERED THE BRIDE WHO HAD NEVER BEEN A WIFE AND SHE RETURNED TO ENGLAND WITH HER FRIENDS WHILE WAKEFIELD WENT ON ALONE TO PARIS
LJ011-0210 MR. WILLIAM WAKEFIELD WAS ARRESTED AT DOVER CONVEYED TO CHESTER AND COMMITTED TO LANCASTER JAIL FOR TRIAL AT THE NEXT ASSIZES
LJ011-0211 WHEN INDICTMENTS WERE PREFERRED AGAINST BOTH BROTHERS FOR HAVING CARRIED AWAY ELLEN TURNER SPINSTER
LJ011-0212 THEN A MAID AND HEIR APPARENT UNTO HER FATHER FOR THE SAKE OF THE LUCRE OF HER SUBSTANCE AND FOR HAVING AFTERWARDS UNLAWFULLY AND AGAINST HER WILL
LJ011-0213 MARRIED THE SAID ELLEN TURNER
LJ011-0214 THEY WERE TRIED IN MARCH OF THE FOLLOWING YEAR EDWARD WAKEFIELD HAVING APPARENTLY GIVEN HIMSELF UP
LJ011-0215 AND FOUND GUILTY REMAINING IN LANCASTER JAIL FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS WHEN THEY WERE BROUGHT UP TO THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH FOR JUDGMENT
LJ011-0216 THE PROSECUTION PRESSED FOR A SEVERE PENALTY. EDWARD WAKEFIELD PLEADED THAT HIS TRIAL HAD ALREADY COST HIM £3000
LJ011-0217 MR. JUSTICE BAYLEY IN SUMMING UP
LJ011-0218 SPOKE SEVERELY OF THE GROSS DECEPTION PRACTICED UPON AN INNOCENT GIRL AND SENTENCED THE BROTHERS EACH TO THREE YEARS' IMPRISONMENT
LJ011-0219 WILLIAM WAKEFIELD IN LANCASTER JAIL AND EDWARD GIBBON WAKEFIELD IN NEWGATE WHICH SENTENCES WERE DULY ENFORCED
LJ011-0220 THE MARRIAGE WAS ANNULLED BY AN ACT OF PARLIAMENT ALTHOUGH WAKEFIELD PETITIONED AGAINST IT
LJ011-0221 AND WAS BROUGHT FROM NEWGATE AT HIS OWN REQUEST TO OPPOSE THE SECOND READING OF THE BILL
LJ011-0222 HE ALSO WROTE AND PUBLISHED A PAMPHLET FROM THE JAIL TO SHOW THAT MISS TURNER HAD BEEN A CONSENTING PARTY TO THE MARRIAGE AND WAS REALLY HIS WIFE
LJ011-0223 NEITHER HIS ADDRESS NOR HIS PAMPHLET AVAILED MUCH FOR THE BILL FOR THE DIVORCE PASSED BOTH HOUSES
LJ011-0224 THAT MR. WAKEFIELD WAS A SHREWD CRITIC AND CLOSE OBSERVER OF ALL THAT WENT ON IN THE NEWGATE OF THOSE DAYS
LJ011-0225 WILL BE ADMITTED BY THOSE WHO HAVE READ HIS BOOK ON THE PUNISHMENT OF DEATH
LJ011-0226 WHICH WAS BASED ON HIS JAIL EXPERIENCES AND OF WHICH I HAVE AVAILED MYSELF IN THE LAST CHAPTER
LJ011-0227 AFTER THEIR RELEASE FROM LANCASTER AND NEWGATE RESPECTIVELY BOTH WAKEFIELDS WENT ABROAD
LJ011-0228 MR. W. WAKEFIELD SERVED IN A CONTINENTAL ARMY AND ROSE TO THE RANK OF COLONEL
LJ011-0229 AFTER WHICH HE WENT TO NEW ZEALAND AND HELD AN IMPORTANT POST IN THAT COLONY
LJ011-0230 MR. E. G. WAKEFIELD TOOK PART IN THE SCHEME FOR THE COLONIZATION OF NORTH AUSTRALIA AND FOR SOME YEARS RESIDED IN THAT COLONY
LJ011-0231 MISS TURNER SUBSEQUENTLY MARRIED MR. LEGH OF LYM HALL CHESHIRE
LJ011-0232 IT MUST NOT BE IMAGINED THAT ALTHOUGH HIGHWAY ROBBERY WAS NOW NEARLY EXTINCT AND FELONIOUS OUTRAGES IN THE STREETS WERE RARE
LJ011-0233 THAT THIEVES OR DEPREDATORS WERE IDLE OR ENTIRELY UNSUCCESSFUL
LJ011-0234 BIGGER JOBS THAN EVER WERE PLANNED AND ATTEMPTED
LJ011-0235 AS IN THE BURGLARY AT LAMBETH PALACE WHEN THE THIEVES WERE FORTUNATELY DISAPPOINTED THE ARCHBISHOP HAVING BEFORE HE LEFT TOWN
LJ011-0236 SENT HIS PLATECHESTS EIGHT IN NUMBER TO THE SILVERSMITH'S FOR GREATER SECURITY
LJ011-0237 THE JEWELERS WERE ALWAYS A FAVORITE PREY OF THE LONDON THIEVES
LJ011-0238 SHOPS WERE BROKEN INTO AS WHEN THAT OF GRIMALDI AND JOHNSON IN THE STRAND WAS ROBBED OF WATCHES TO THE VALUE OF £6000
LJ011-0239 WHERE ROBBERY WITH VIOLENCE WAS INTENDED THE PERPETRATORS HAD NOW TO ADOPT VARIOUS SHIFTS AND CONTRIVANCES TO SECURE THEIR VICTIM
LJ011-0240 NO MORE CURIOUS INSTANCE OF THIS EVER OCCURRED THAN THE ASSAULT MADE BY ONE HOWARD UPON A MR. MULLAY WITH INTENT TO ROB HIM
LJ011-0241 THE LATTER HAD ADVERTISED OFFERING A SUM OF £1000 TO ANYONE WHO WOULD INTRODUCE HIM TO SOME MERCANTILE EQUIPMENT
LJ011-0242 HOWARD REPLIED DESIRING MR. MULLAY TO CALL UPON HIM IN A HOUSE IN RED LION SQUARE
LJ011-0243 MR. MULLAY WENT AND A SECOND INTERVIEW WAS AGREED UPON WHEN A THIRD PERSON MR. OWEN
LJ011-0244 THROUGH WHOSE INTEREST AN APPOINTMENT UNDER GOVERNMENT WAS TO BE OBTAINED FOR MULLAY WOULD BE PRESENT
LJ011-0245 MR. MULLAY CALLED AGAIN TAKING WITH HIM £500 IN CASH HOWARD DISCOVERED THIS AND HIS MANNER WAS VERY SUSPICIOUS
LJ011-0246 THERE WERE WEAPONS IN THE ROOM  A LONG KNIFE A HEAVY TRAPBALL BAT AND A POKER
LJ011-0247 MR. MULLAY BECAME ALARMED AND AS MR. OWEN DID NOT APPEAR WITHDREW
LJ011-0248 HOWARD STRANGE TO SAY MAKING NO ATTEMPT TO DETAIN HIM PROBABLY BECAUSE MULLAY PROMISED TO RETURN A FEW DAYS LATER AND TO BRING MORE MONEY
LJ011-0249 ON THIS RENEWED VISIT MR. OWEN WAS STILL ABSENT AND MR. MULLAY AGREED TO WRITE HIM A NOTE FROM A COPY HOWARD GAVE HIM
LJ011-0250 WHILE THUS ENGAGED HOWARD THRUST THE POKER INTO THE FIRE
LJ011-0251 MULLAY PROTESTED AND THEN HOWARD UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF UNGOVERNABLE RAGE AS IT SEEMED JUMPED UP
LJ011-0252 LOCKED THE DOOR AND ATTACKED MULLAY VIOLENTLY WITH THE TRAPBALL BAT AND KNIFE
LJ011-0253 MULLAY DEFENDED HIMSELF AND MANAGED TO BREAK THE KNIFE BUT NOT BEFORE HE HAD CUT HIMSELF SEVERELY
LJ011-0254 A LIFE AND DEATH STRUGGLE ENSUED MULLAY CRIED MURDER
LJ011-0255 HOWARD SWORE HE WOULD FINISH HIM BUT PROVED THE WEAKER OF THE TWO AND MULLAY GOT HIM DOWN ON THE FLOOR
LJ011-0256 BY THIS TIME THE NEIGHBORS WERE AROUSED AND SEVERAL PEOPLE CAME TO THE SCENE OF THE AFFRAY
LJ011-0257 HOWARD WAS SECURED GIVEN INTO CUSTODY AND COMMITTED TO NEWGATE
LJ011-0258 THE DEFENSE HE SET UP WAS THAT MULLAY HAD USED EPITHETS TOWARDS HIM WHILE THEY WERE NEGOTIATING A BUSINESS MATTER
LJ011-0259 AND THAT BEING AN IRRITABLE TEMPER HE HAD STRUCK MULLAY AFTER WHICH A VIOLENT SCUFFLE TOOK PLACE
LJ011-0260 IT WAS HOWEVER PROVED THAT HOWARD WAS IN NEEDY CIRCUMSTANCES AND THAT HIS PROPOSALS TO MR. MULLAY COULD ONLY HAVE ORIGINATED IN A DESIRE TO ROB HIM
LJ011-0261 HE WAS FOUND GUILTY OF AN ASSAULT WITH INTENT AND SENTENCED TO TRANSPORTATION FOR FOURTEEN YEARS
LJ011-0262 A MORE COMPLICATED AND ALTOGETHER MOST EXTRAORDINARY CASE OF ASSAULT WITH INTENT TO EXTORT MONEY OCCURRED A FEW YEARS LATER
LJ011-0263 IT WAS PERPETRATED UPON A RESPECTABLE COUNTRY SOLICITOR
LJ011-0264 MR. GEE OF BISHOP STORTFORD WHO ADMINISTERED THE ESTATE OF A CERTAIN MR. CANNING DECEASED
LJ011-0265 THIS MR. CANNING HAD LEFT HIS WIDOW A LIFE INTEREST IN £2000 SO LONG AS SHE REMAINED UNMARRIED
LJ011-0266 THE MONEY WENT AFTER HER TO HER CHILDREN
LJ011-0267 MR. GEE HAD INVESTED £1200 OF THIS AND WAS SEEKING HOW BEST TO PLACE THE REMAINING £800
LJ011-0268 WHEN HE WAS ASKED TO MEET A MR. HEATH IN LONDON WITH REGARD TO THE SALE OF CERTAIN LANDS AT BISHOP STORTFORD
LJ011-0269 AN APPOINTMENT WAS MADE AND KEPT BY MR. GEE
LJ011-0270 BUT ON ARRIVAL HE WAS MET BY A YOUNG SAILOR WITH A LETTER WHICH BEGGED MR. GEE TO GO TO HEATH'S HOUSE AS THE LATTER WAS NOT WELL
LJ011-0271 MR. GEE WENT IN THE COACH SENT FOR HIM AND ALIGHTED AT 27 YORK STREET WEST COMMERCIAL ROAD
LJ011-0272 THE COACH IMMEDIATELY DROVE OFF MR. GEE ENTERED THE HOUSE ASKED FOR MR. HEATH WAS TOLD HE WOULD FIND HIM IN THE BACK KITCHEN AT BREAKFAST
LJ011-0273 HE WAS ABOUT TO DESCEND THE STAIRS WHEN THREE PERSONS ONE OF THEM THE YOUNG SAILOR
LJ011-0274 FELL UPON HIM AND IN SPITE OF HIS RESISTANCE CARRIED HIM INTO A SORT OF DEN PARTITIONED OFF AT THE END OF THE BACK KITCHEN
LJ011-0275 THERE HE WAS SEATED ON SOME SORT OF WOODEN BENCH AND SECURELY FASTENED
LJ011-0276 A CHAIN FIXED TO STAPLES AT HIS BACK PASSED ROUND HIS CHEST UNDER HIS ARMS AND WAS PADLOCKED ON THE LEFT SIDE
LJ011-0277 HIS FEET WERE BOUND WITH CORDS AND MADE FAST TO RINGS IN THE FLOOR THUS MANACLED ONE OF THE PARTY WHO PRETENDED TO BE MRS. CANNING'S BROTHER
LJ011-0278 ADDRESSED HIM INSISTING THAT HE SHOULD FORTHWITH SIGN A CHEQUE FOR THE £800 OF THE CANNING INHERITANCE STILL UNINVESTED
LJ011-0279 AND WRITE AN ORDER SUFFICIENT TO SECURE THE SURRENDER OF THE OTHER £1200
LJ011-0280 MR. GEE AT FIRST STOUTLY REFUSED
LJ011-0281 THEN AS THEY WARNED HIM THAT HE WOULD BE KEPT A PRISONER IN TOTAL DARKNESS IN THIS HORRIBLE DEN UNTIL HE AGREED TO THEIR DEMANDS
LJ011-0282 HE GAVE IN AND SIGNED THE DOCUMENTS THUS ILLEGALLY EXTORTED
LJ011-0283 ONE WAS A CHEQUE FOR £800 ON HIS BANKERS THE OTHER AN ORDER TO MR. BELL OF NEWPORT ESSEX REQUESTING THE SURRENDER OF A DEED
LJ011-0284 HIS CAPTORS HAVING THUS SUCCEEDED IN THEIR DESIGNS LEFT HIM NO DOUBT TO REALIZE THE MONEY
LJ011-0285 THE DOOR OF HIS PLACE OF DURANCE STOOD OPEN AND MR. GEE BEGAN TO CONSIDER WHETHER HE MIGHT NOT ESCAPE
LJ011-0286 FOR THREE HOURS HE STRUGGLED WITHOUT SUCCESS WITH HIS BONDS
LJ011-0287 BUT AT LENGTH MANAGED TO WRIGGLE OUT OF THE CHAIN WHICH CONFINED HIS BODY AND SOON LOOSENED THE ROPES ROUND HIS FEET
LJ011-0288 THUS FREE HE ELUDED THE VIGILANCE OF TWO OF THE PARTY WHO WERE AT DINNER IN THE FRONT KITCHEN
LJ011-0289 AND CREEPING OUT INTO THE GARDEN AT THE BACK CLIMBED THE WALL AND GOT INTO THE STREET
LJ011-0290 HIS FIRST ACT WAS TO SEND A MESSENGER TO STOP THE CHEQUE AND THE ORDER TO MR. BELL HIS NEXT TO SEEK THE HELP OF THE POLICE
LJ011-0291 TWO BOW STREET RUNNERS WERE DISPATCHED TO THE HOUSE IN YORK STREET WHICH HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN TAKEN ON PURPOSE FOR THE OUTRAGE
LJ011-0292 THERE WAS NO FURNITURE IN THE PLACE AND THE DEN IN THE KITCHEN HAD BEEN RECENTLY AND SPECIALLY CONSTRUCTED OF BOARDS OF IMMENSE STRENGTH AND THICKNESS
LJ011-0293 IT WAS A CELL FIVE FEET BY THREE WITHIN ANOTHER THE INTERVENING BEING FILLED WITH RAMMED EARTH TO DEADEN THE SOUND
LJ012-0001 THE CHRONICLES OF NEWGATE VOLUME TWO BY ARTHUR GRIFFITHS SECTION FIFTEEN NEWGATE NOTORIETIES PART THREE
LJ012-0002 ON THE ARRIVAL OF THE POLICE THE HOUSE WAS EMPTY
LJ012-0003 THE TWO MEN ON GUARD HAD GONE OFF IMMEDIATELY AFTER MR. GEE HAD ESCAPED BUT THEY RETURNED LATER IN THE DAY AND WERE APPREHENDED
LJ012-0004 INQUIRIES SET ON FOOT ALSO ELICITED THE SUSPICION THAT THE PERSON WHO HAD REPRESENTED MRS. CANNING'S BROTHER
LJ012-0005 WAS A BLIND MAN NAMED EDWARDS WHO HAD TAKEN THIS HOUSE IN YORK STREET AND WHO WAS KNOWN TO BE A FREQUENT VISITOR AT MRS. CANNING'S
LJ012-0006 A WATCH WAS SET ON HIM AT HER HOUSE WHERE HE WAS SOON AFTERWARDS ARRESTED
LJ012-0007 EDWARDS WHOM MR. GEE EASILY IDENTIFIED WITH THE OTHERS AT ONCE ADMITTED THAT HE WAS THE PRIME MOVER OF THE CONSPIRACY
LJ012-0008 HE HAD SOUGHT BY ALL LEGAL MEANS TO OBTAIN POSSESSION OF THE £2000 BUT HAD FAILED AND HAD HAD RECOURSE TO MORE VIOLENT MEANS
LJ012-0009 IT TURNED OUT THAT HE WAS REALLY MARRIED TO MRS. CANNING
LJ012-0010 BOTH HAVING BEEN RECOGNIZED BY THE CLERGYMAN WHO HAD PERFORMED THE CEREMONY AND THE ASSAULT HAD BEEN COMMITTED TO SECURE THE MONEY
LJ012-0011 WHICH MRS. CANNING HAD LOST BY REMARRIAGE
LJ012-0012 ALL THREE MEN WERE COMMITTED FOR TRIAL ALTHOUGH EDWARDS WISHED TO EXCULPATE THE OTHERS AS HAVING ONLY ACTED UNDER HIS ORDER
LJ012-0013 AT THE TRIAL THE INDICTMENT CHARGING THEM WITH FELONY COULD NOT BE SUSTAINED BUT THEY WERE FOUND GUILTY OF CONSPIRACY AND ASSAULT
LJ012-0014 EDWARDS WAS SENTENCED TO TWO YEARS' IMPRISONMENT IN NEWGATE
LJ012-0015 WEEDON AND LECASSER TO TWELVE AND SIX MONTHS RESPECTIVELY IN COLDBATH FIELDS
LJ012-0016 AT NO PERIOD COULD THIEVES IN LONDON OR ELSEWHERE HAVE PROSPERED HAD THEY BEEN UNABLE TO DISPOSE OF THEIR ILLGOTTEN GOODS
LJ012-0017 THE TRADE OF FENCE OR RECEIVER THEREFORE IS VERY NEARLY AS OLD AS THE CRIMES WHICH IT SO OBVIOUSLY FOSTERED
LJ012-0018 ONE OF THE MOST NOTORIOUS AND FOR A TIME MOST SUCCESSFUL PRACTITIONERS IN THIS ILLICIT TRADE PASSED THROUGH NEWGATE IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY ONE
LJ012-0019 THE NAME OF IKEY SOLOMONS WAS LONG REMEMBERED BY THIEF AND THIEFTAKER
LJ012-0020 HE BEGAN AS AN ITINERANT STREET VENDOR AT EIGHT AT TEN HE PASSED BAD MONEY
LJ012-0021 AT FOURTEEN HE WAS A PICKPOCKET AND A DUFFER OR A SELLER OF SHAM GOODS
LJ012-0022 HE EARLY SAW THE PROFITS TO BE MADE OUT OF PURCHASING STOLEN GOODS BUT COULD NOT EMBARK IN IT AT FIRST FOR WANT OF CAPITAL
LJ012-0023 HE WAS TAKEN UP WHEN STILL IN HIS TEENS FOR STEALING A POCKETBOOK AND WAS SENTENCED TO TRANSPORTATION BUT DID NOT GET BEYOND THE HULKS AT CHATHAM
LJ012-0024 ON HIS RELEASE AN UNCLE A SLOPSELLER IN CHATHAM GAVE HIM A SITUATION AS BARKER OR SALESMAN
LJ012-0025 AT WHICH HE REALIZED £150 WITHIN A COUPLE OF YEARS
LJ012-0026 WITH THIS CAPITAL HE RETURNED TO LONDON AND SET UP AS A FENCE
LJ012-0027 HE HAD SUCH GREAT APTITUDE FOR BUSINESS AND SUCH A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF THE REAL VALUE OF GOODS
LJ012-0028 THAT HE WAS SOON ADMITTED TO BE ONE OF THE BEST JUDGES KNOWN OF ALL KINDS OF PROPERTY FROM A GLASS BOTTLE TO A FIVE HUNDRED GUINEA CHRONOMETER
LJ012-0029 BUT HE NEVER PAID MORE THAN A FIXED PRICE FOR ALL ARTICLES OF THE SAME CLASS WHATEVER THEIR INTRINSIC VALUE
LJ012-0030 THUS A WATCH WAS PAID FOR AS A WATCH WHETHER IT WAS OF GOLD OR SILVER A PIECE OF LINEN AS SUCH WHETHER THE STUFF WAS COARSE OR FINE
LJ012-0031 THIS RULE IN DEALING WITH STOLEN GOODS CONTINUES TO THIS DAY AND HAS MADE THE FORTUNE OF MANY SINCE IKEY
LJ012-0032 SOLOMONS ALSO ESTABLISHED A SYSTEM OF PROVINCIAL AGENCY BY WHICH STOLEN GOODS WERE PASSED ON FROM LONDON TO THE SEAPORTS AND SO ABROAD
LJ012-0033 JEWELS WERE RESET
LJ012-0034 DIAMONDS REFACED ALL MARKS BY WHICH OTHER ARTICLES MIGHT BE IDENTIFIED THE SELVAGES OF LINEN THE STAMPS ON SHOES
LJ012-0035 THE NUMBER AND NAMES ON WATCHES WERE CAREFULLY REMOVED OR OBLITERATED AFTER THE GOODS PASSED OUT OF HIS HANDS
LJ012-0036 ON ONE OCCASION THE WHOLE OF THE PROCEEDS OF A ROBBERY FROM A BOOT SHOP WAS TRACED TO SOLOMONS'
LJ012-0037 THE OWNER CAME WITH THE POLICE AND WAS MORALLY CONVINCED THAT IT WAS HIS PROPERTY
LJ012-0038 BUT COULD NOT POSITIVELY IDENTIFY IT AND IKEY DEFIED THEM TO REMOVE A SINGLE SHOE
LJ012-0039 IN THE END THE INJURED BOOTMAKER AGREED TO BUY BACK HIS STOLEN STOCK
LJ012-0040 AT THE PRICE SOLOMONS HAD PAID FOR IT AND IT COST HIM ABOUT A HUNDRED POUNDS TO RESTOCK HIS SHOP WITH HIS OWN GOODS
LJ012-0041 AS A GENERAL RULE IKEY SOLOMONS CONFINED HIS PURCHASES TO SMALL ARTICLES MOSTLY OF JEWELERY AND PLATE
LJ012-0042 WHICH HE KEPT CONCEALED IN A HIDINGPLACE WITH A TRAPDOOR JUST UNDER HIS BED
LJ012-0043 HE LIVED IN ROSEMARY LANE AND SOMETIMES HE HAD AS MUCH AS £20000 WORTH OF GOODS SECRETED ON THE PREMISES
LJ012-0044 WHEN HIS TRADE WAS BUSIEST HE SET UP A SECOND ESTABLISHMENT AT THE HEAD OF WHICH ALTHOUGH HE WAS MARRIED
LJ012-0045 HE PUT ANOTHER LADY WITH WHOM HE WAS ON INTIMATE TERMS
LJ012-0046 THE SECOND HOUSE WAS IN LOWER QUEEN STREET ISLINGTON AND HE USED IT FOR SOME TIME AS A DEPOT FOR VALUABLES
LJ012-0047 BUT IT WAS EVENTUALLY DISCOVERED BY MRS. SOLOMONS A VERY JEALOUS WIFE
LJ012-0048 AND THIS WITH THE DANGER ARISING FROM AN EXTENSIVE ROBBERY OF WATCHES IN CHEAPSIDE IN WHICH IKEY WAS IMPLICATED AS A RECEIVER
LJ012-0049 LED HIM TO THINK SERIOUSLY OF TRYING HIS FORTUNES IN ANOTHER LAND
LJ012-0050 HE WAS ABOUT TO EMIGRATE TO NEW SOUTH WALES WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED AT ISLINGTON AND COMMITTED TO NEWGATE ON A CHARGE OF RECEIVING STOLEN GOODS
LJ012-0051 WHILE THUS INCARCERATED HE MANAGED TO ESCAPE FROM CUSTODY BUT NOT ACTUALLY FROM JAIL BY AN INGENIOUS CONTRIVANCE WHICH IS WORTH MENTIONING
LJ012-0052 HE CLAIMED TO BE ADMITTED TO BAIL AND WAS TAKEN FROM NEWGATE ON A WRIT OF HABEAS BEFORE ONE OF THE JUDGES SITTING AT WESTMINSTER
LJ012-0053 HE WAS CONVEYED IN A COACH DRIVEN BY A CONFEDERATE AND UNDER THE ESCORT OF A COUPLE OF TURNKEYS
LJ012-0054 SOLOMONS WHILE WAITING TO APPEAR IN COURT PERSUADED THE TURNKEYS TO TAKE HIM TO A PUBLICHOUSE WHERE ALL MIGHT REFRESH
LJ012-0055 WHILE THERE HE WAS JOINED BY HIS WIFE AND OTHER FRIENDS
LJ012-0056 AFTER A SHORT CAROUSE THE PRISONER WENT INTO WESTMINSTER HIS CASE WAS HEARD BAIL REFUSED AND HE WAS ORDERED BACK TO NEWGATE
LJ012-0057 BUT HE ONCE MORE PERSUADED THE TURNKEYS TO PAUSE AT THE PUBLIC WHERE MORE LIQUOR WAS CONSUMED
LJ012-0058 WHEN THE JOURNEY WAS RESUMED MRS. SOLOMONS ACCOMPANIED HER HUSBAND IN THE COACH. HALFWAY TO NEWGATE SHE WAS TAKEN WITH A FIT
LJ012-0059 ONE TURNKEY WAS STUPIDLY DRUNK AND IKEY PERSUADED THE OTHER WHO WAS NOT MUCH BETTER
LJ012-0060 TO LET THE COACH CHANGE AND PASS PETTICOAT LANE EN ROUTE TO THE JAIL WHERE THE SUFFERING WOMAN MIGHT BE HANDED OVER TO HER FRIENDS
LJ012-0061 ON STOPPING AT A DOOR IN THIS LOW STREET IKEY JUMPED OUT RAN INTO THE HOUSE SLAMMING THE DOOR BEHIND HIM
LJ012-0062 HE PASSED THROUGH AND OUT AT THE BACK AND WAS SOON BEYOND PURSUIT
LJ012-0063 BYANDBY THE TURNKEYS SOBERED BY THEIR LOSS RETURNED TO NEWGATE ALONE AND PLEADED IN EXCUSE THAT THEY HAD BEEN DRUGGED
LJ012-0064 IKEY LEFT NO TRACES AND THE POLICE COULD HEAR NOTHING OF HIM HE HAD IN FACT GONE OUT OF THE COUNTRY TO COPENHAGEN WHENCE HE PASSED ON TO NEW YORK
LJ012-0065 THERE HE DEVOTED HIMSELF TO THE CIRCULATION OF FORGED NOTES HE WAS ALSO ANXIOUS TO DO BUSINESS IN WATCHES
LJ012-0066 AND BEGGED HIS WIFE TO SEND HIM OVER A CONSIGNMENT OF CHEAP RIGHTEOUS WATCHES OR SUCH AS HAD BEEN HONESTLY OBTAINED AND NOT ON THE CROSS
LJ012-0067 BUT MRS. SOLOMONS COULD NOT RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO DABBLE IN STOLEN GOODS AND SHE WAS FOUND SHIPPING WATCHES OF THE WRONG CATEGORY TO NEW YORK
LJ012-0068 FOR THIS SHE RECEIVED A SENTENCE OF FOURTEEN YEARS' TRANSPORTATION AND WAS SENT TO VAN DIEMEN'S LAND
LJ012-0069 IKEY JOINED HER AT HOBART TOWN WHERE THEY SET UP A GENERAL SHOP AND SOON BEGAN TO PROSPER
LJ012-0070 HE WAS HOWEVER RECOGNIZED AND ERE LONG AN ORDER CAME OUT FROM HOME FOR HIS ARREST AND TRANSFER TO ENGLAND
LJ012-0071 WHICH PRESENTLY FOLLOWED AND AGAIN FOUND HIMSELF AN INMATE OF NEWGATE WAITING TRIAL AS A RECEIVER AND A PRISONBREAKER
LJ012-0072 HE WAS INDICTED ON EIGHT CHARGES TWO ONLY OF WHICH WERE SUBSTANTIATED BUT ON EACH OF THEM HE RECEIVED A SENTENCE OF SEVEN YEARS' TRANSPORTATION
LJ012-0073 AT HIS OWN REQUEST HE WAS RECONVEYED TO HOBART TOWN WHERE HIS SON HAD BEEN CARRYING ON THE BUSINESS
LJ012-0074 WHETHER IKEY WAS ASSIGNED TO HIS OWN FAMILY IS NOT RECORDED BUT NO DOUBT HE SUCCEEDED TO HIS OWN PROPERTY WHEN THE TERM OF SERVITUDE HAD EXPIRED
LJ012-0075 NO DOUBT ON THE REMOVAL OF IKEY SOLOMONS FROM THE SCENE HIS MANTLE FELL UPON WORTHY SUCCESSORS
LJ012-0076 THERE WAS AN INCREASE RATHER THAN AN ABATEMENT IN JEWEL AND BULLION ROBBERIES IN THE YEARS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING
LJ012-0077 AND THE THIEVES SEEM TO HAVE HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN DISPOSING OF THEIR SPOIL
LJ012-0078 ONE OF THE LARGEST ROBBERIES OF ITS CLASS WAS THAT EFFECTED UPON THE CUSTOM HOUSE IN THE WINTER OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY FOUR
LJ012-0079 A LARGE AMOUNT OF SPECIE WAS NEARLY ALWAYS RETAINED HERE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF THE RECEIVER OF FINES
LJ012-0080 THIS WAS KNOWN TO SOME CLERKS IN THE OFFICE WHO BEGAN TO CONSIDER HOW THEY MIGHT LAY HANDS ON A LOT OF CASH
LJ012-0081 BEING INEXPERIENCED THEY DECIDED TO CALL IN THE SERVICES OF A COUPLE OF PROFESSIONAL HOUSEBREAKERS
LJ012-0082 JORDAN AND SULLIVAN WHO AT ONCE SET TO WORK IN A BUSINESSLIKE WAY TO OBTAIN IMPRESSIONS OF THE KEYS OF THE STRONG ROOM AND CHEST
LJ012-0083 BUT BEFORE COMMITTING THEMSELVES TO AN ATTEMPT ON THE LATTER IT WAS OF IMPORTANCE TO ASCERTAIN HOW MUCH IT USUALLY CONTAINED
LJ012-0084 FOR THIS PURPOSE JORDAN WAITED ON THE RECEIVER TO MAKE A SMALL PAYMENT FOR WHICH HE TENDERED A FIFTYPOUND NOTE
LJ012-0085 THE CHEST WAS OPENED TO GIVE CHANGE AND A HEAVY TRAY LIFTED OUT WHICH PLAINLY HELD SOME £4000 IN CASH
LJ012-0086 SOME DIFFICULTY THEN AROSE AS TO GAINING ADMISSION TO THE STRONG ROOM AND IT WAS ARRANGED THAT A MAN MAY ANOTHER CUSTOM HOUSE CLERK
LJ012-0087 SHOULD BE INTRODUCED INTO THE BUILDING AND SECRETED THERE DURING THE NIGHT TO ACCOMPLISH THE ROBBERY
LJ012-0088 MAY WAS SMUGGLED IN THROUGH A WINDOW ON THE ESPLANADE BEHIND AN OPENED UMBRELLA WHEN THE PLACE WAS QUITE DESERTED
LJ012-0089 HE BROKE OPEN THE CHEST AND STOLE £4700 IN NOTES WITH A QUANTITY OF GOLD AND SOME SILVER
LJ012-0090 HE WENT OUT NEXT MORNING WITH THE BOOTY WHEN THE DOORS WERE REOPENED AND ATTRACTED NO ATTENTION
LJ012-0091 THE SPOIL WAS FAIRLY DIVIDED PART OF THE NOTES WERE DISPOSED OF TO A TRAVELING RECEIVER WHO PASSED OVER TO THE CONTINENT AND THERE CASHED THEM EASILY
LJ012-0092 THIS OCCURRED IN NOVEMBER EIGHTEEN THIRTY FOUR THE CUSTOM HOUSE OFFICIALS WERE IN A STATE OF CONSTERNATION
LJ012-0093 AND THE POLICE WERE UNABLE AT FIRST TO GET ON THE TRACK OF THE THIEVES
LJ012-0094 WHILE THE EXCITEMENT WAS STILL FRESH A NEW ROBBERY OF DIAMONDS WAS COMMITTED AT A BONDED WAREHOUSE IN THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORHOOD ON CUSTOM HOUSE QUAY
LJ012-0095 THE JEWELS HAD BELONGED TO A SPANISH COUNTESS RECENTLY DECEASED WHO HAD SENT THEM TO ENGLAND FOR GREATER SECURITY ON THE OUTBREAK OF THE FIRST CARLIST WAR
LJ012-0096 AT HER DEATH THE DIAMONDS WERE DIVIDED BETWEEN HER FOUR DAUGHTERS BUT ONLY HALF HAD BEEN CLAIMED
LJ012-0097 AND AT THE TIME OF THE ROBBERY THERE WERE STILL £6000 WORTH IN THE WAREHOUSE
LJ012-0098 THESE WERE DEPOSITED IN AN IRON CHEST OF GREAT STRENGTH ON THE SECOND FLOOR
LJ012-0099 THE THIEVES IT WAS SUPPOSED HAD SECRETED THEMSELVES IN THE WAREHOUSE DURING BUSINESS HOURS AND WAITED TILL NIGHT TO CARRY OUT THEIR PLANS
LJ012-0100 SOME HAM SANDWICHES SEVERAL CIGAR ENDS AND TWO EMPTY CHAMPAGNE BOTTLES WERE FOUND ON THE PREMISES NEXT DAY SHOWING HOW THEY HAD PASSED THEIR TIME
LJ012-0101 THEY HAD HAD SERIOUS WORK TO GET AT THE DIAMONDS. IT WAS NECESSARY TO FORCE ONE HEAVY DOOR FROM ITS HINGES AND TO CUT THROUGH THE THICK PANELS OF ANOTHER
LJ012-0102 THE LOCK AND FASTENINGS OF THE CHEST WERE FORCED BY MEANS OF A JACK AN INSTRUMENT KNOWN TO HOUSEBREAKERS
LJ012-0103 WHICH IF INTRODUCED INTO A KEYHOLE AND WORKED LIKE A BIT AND BRACE WILL SOON DESTROY THE STRONGEST LOCK
LJ012-0104 THE THIEVES WERE SATISFIED WITH THE DIAMONDS THEY BROKE OPEN OTHER CASES CONTAINING GOLD WATCHES AND PLATE BUT ABSTRACTED NOTHING
LJ012-0105 THE POLICE WERE OF OPINION THAT THESE ROBBERIES WERE BOTH THE WORK OF THE SAME HAND
LJ012-0106 BUT IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE AUTUMN THAT THEY TRACED SOME OF THE NOTES STOLEN FROM THE CUSTOM HOUSE TO JORDAN AND SULLIVAN
LJ012-0107 ABOUT THIS TIME ALSO SUSPICION FELL UPON HUEY ONE OF THE CLERKS WHO WAS ARRESTED SOON AFTERWARDS AND MADE A CLEAN BREAST OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR
LJ012-0108 THERE WAS A HUNT FOR THE TWO WELLKNOWN HOUSEBREAKERS WHO WERE EVENTUALLY HEARD OF AT A LODGING IN KENNINGTON
LJ012-0109 BUT THEY AT ONCE MADE TRACKS AND TOOK UP THEIR RESIDENCE UNDER ASSUMED NAMES IN A TAVERN IN BLOOMSBURY
LJ012-0110 THE POLICE LOST ALL TRACE OF THEM FOR SOME DAYS BUT AT LENGTH SULLIVAN'S BROTHER WAS FOLLOWED FROM THE HOUSE IN KENNINGTON TO THE ABOVEMENTIONED TAVERN
LJ012-0111 BOTH THE THIEVES WERE NOW APPREHENDED BUT ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF THE LOST PROPERTY WAS RECOVERED
LJ012-0112 NOTWITHSTANDING A MINUTE SEARCH THROUGH THE ROOM THEY HAD OCCUPIED
LJ012-0113 AFTER THEIR ARREST JORDAN'S WIFE AND SULLIVAN'S BROTHER CAME TO THE INN AND BEGGED TO BE ALLOWED TO VISIT THIS ROOM
LJ012-0114 BUT THEIR REQUEST IN SPITE OF THEIR EARNEST ENTREATIES
LJ012-0115 WAS REFUSED AT THE INSTIGATION OF THE POLICE A FEW DAYS LATER A FREQUENT GUEST AT THE TAVERN ARRIVED AND HAD THIS SAME ROOM ALLOTTED TO HIM
LJ012-0116 A FIRE WAS LIT IN IT AND THE MAID IN DOING SO THREW A LOT OF RUBBISH AS IT SEEMED WHICH HAD ACCUMULATED UNDER THE GRATE ON TOP OF THE BURNING COALS
LJ012-0117 BYANDBY THE OCCUPANT OF THE ROOM NOTICED SOMETHING GLITTERING IN THE CENTER OF THE FIRE WHICH TO INSPECT MORE CLOSELY HE TOOK OUT WITH THE TONGS
LJ012-0118 IT WAS A LARGE GOLD BROOCH SET IN PEARLS BUT A PORTION OF THE MOUNTING HAD MELTED WITH THE HEAT
LJ012-0119 THE FIRE WAS RAKED OUT AND IN THE ASHES WERE FOUND SEVEN LARGE AND FOUR DOZEN SMALL BRILLIANTS ALSO SEVEN EMERALDS
LJ012-0120 ONE OF THEM OF CONSIDERABLE SIZE
LJ012-0121 A PART OF THE SWAG STOLEN FROM THE BONDED WAREHOUSE WAS THUS RECOVERED BUT IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT A NUMBER OF THE STOLEN NOTES HAD PERISHED IN THE FIRE
LJ012-0122 THE CONDIGN PUNISHMENT METED OUT TO THESE CUSTOM HOUSE ROBBERS HAD NO DETERRENT EFFECT SEEMINGLY
LJ012-0123 WITHIN THREE MONTHS THREE NEW AND MOST MYSTERIOUS BURGLARIES WERE COMMITTED AT THE WEST END ALL IN HOUSES ADJOINING EACH OTHER
LJ012-0124 ONE WAS OCCUPIED BY THE PORTUGUESE AMBASSADOR WHO LOST A QUANTITY OF JEWELERY FROM AN ESCRITOIRE AND HIS NEIGHBORS LOST PLATE AND CASH
LJ012-0125 NOT THE SLIGHTEST CLUE TO THESE LARGE AFFAIRS WAS EVER OBTAINED BUT IT IS PROBABLE THAT THEY WERE PUT UP JOBS OR MANAGED WITH THE COMPLICITY OF SERVANTS
LJ012-0126 THE NEXT YEAR TWELVE THOUSAND SOVEREIGNS WERE CLEVERLY STOLEN IN THE MILE END ROAD
LJ012-0127 THE GOLDDUST ROBBERY OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE THE FIRST OF ITS KIND WAS CLEVERLY AND CAREFULLY PLANNED WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF A DISHONEST EMPLOYEE
LJ012-0128 A YOUNG MAN NAMED CASPAR CLERK TO A STEAMSHIP COMPANY
LJ012-0129 LEARNT THROUGH THE FIRM'S CORRESPONDENCE THAT A QUANTITY OF GOLDDUST
LJ012-0130 BROUGHT IN A MANOFWAR FROM BRAZIL HAD BEEN TRANSHIPPED AT FALMOUTH FOR CONVEYANCE TO LONDON
LJ012-0131 THE LETTER INFORMED HIM OF THE MARKS AND SIZES OF THE CASES CONTAINING THE PRECIOUS METAL
LJ012-0132 AND HE WITH HIS FATHER ARRANGED THAT A MESSENGER SHOULD CALL FOR THE STUFF WITH FORGED CREDENTIALS AND ANTICIPATING THE RIGHTFUL OWNER
LJ012-0133 THE FRAUDULENT MESSENGER BY THE HELP OF YOUNG CASPAR ESTABLISHED HIS CLAIM TO THE BOXES PAID THE WHARFAGE DUES AND CARRIED OFF THE GOLDDUST
LJ012-0134 PRESENTLY THE PROPER PERSON ARRIVED FROM THE CONSIGNEES BUT FOUND THE GOLDDUST GONE
LJ012-0135 THE POLICE WERE AT ONCE EMPLOYED AND AFTER INFINITE PAINS THEY DISCOVERED THE PERSON ONE MOSS WHO HAD ACTED AS THE MESSENGER
LJ012-0136 MOSS WAS KNOWN TO BE INTIMATE WITH THE ELDER CASPAR
LJ012-0137 FATHER OF THE CLERK TO THE STEAMSHIP COMPANY AND THESE FACTS WERE DEEMED SUFFICIENT TO JUSTIFY THE ARREST OF ALL THREE
LJ012-0138 THEY ALSO ASCERTAINED THAT A GOLDREFINER
LJ012-0139 SOLOMONS HAD SOLD BAR GOLD TO THE VALUE OF £1200 TO CERTAIN BULLION DEALERS
LJ012-0140 SOLOMONS WAS NOT STRAIGHTFORWARD IN HIS REPLIES AS TO WHERE HE GOT THE GOLD AND HE WAS SOON PLACED IN THE DOCK WITH THE CASPARS AND MOSS
LJ012-0141 MOSS PRESENTLY TURNED APPROVER
LJ012-0142 AND IMPLICATED MONEY MOSES ANOTHER JEW FOR THE WHOLE AFFAIR HAD BEEN PLANNED AND EXECUTED BY MEMBERS OF THE HEBREW PERSUASION
LJ012-0143 MONEY MOSES HAD RECEIVED THE STOLEN GOLDDUST FROM MOSS' FATHERINLAW DAVIS OR ISAACS WHO WAS NEVER ARRESTED
LJ012-0144 AND PASSED IT ON TO SOLOMONS BY HIS DAUGHTER A WIDOW NAMED ABRAHAMS
LJ012-0145 SOLOMONS WAS NOW ALSO ADMITTED AS A WITNESS AND HIS EVIDENCE WITH THAT OF MOSS SECURED THE TRANSPORTATION OF THE PRINCIPAL ACTORS IN THE THEFT
LJ012-0146 IN THE COURSE OF THE TRIAL IT CAME OUT THAT ALMOST EVERY ONE CONCERNED EXCEPT THE CASPARS HAD ENDEAVORED TO DEFRAUD HIS ACCOMPLICES
LJ012-0147 MOSS PEACHED BECAUSE HE DECLARED HE HAD BEEN DONE OUT OF THE PROPER PRICE OF THE GOLDDUST BUT IT WAS CLEAR THAT HE HAD TRIED TO APPROPRIATE THE WHOLE OF THE STUFF
LJ012-0148 INSTEAD OF HANDING IT OR THE PRICE OF IT BACK TO THE CASPARS
LJ012-0149 MONEY MOSES AND MRS. ABRAHAMS IMPOSED UPON MOSS AS TO THE PRICE PAID BY SOLOMONS
LJ012-0150 MRS. ABRAHAMS IMPOSED UPON HER FATHER BY ABSTRACTING A PORTION OF THE DUST AND SELLING IT ON HER OWN ACCOUNT
LJ012-0151 SOLOMONS CHEATED THE WHOLE LOT BY RETAINING HALF THE GOLD IN HIS POSSESSION AND ONLY GIVING AN I. O. U. FOR IT
LJ012-0152 WHICH HE REFUSED TO REDEEM ON ACCOUNT OF THE ROW ABOUT THE ROBBERY
LJ012-0153 MOSES IT MAY BE ADDED WAS A DIRECT DESCENDANT OF IKEY SOLOMONS
LJ012-0154 HE WAS OSTENSIBLY A PUBLICAN
LJ012-0155 AND KEPT THE BLACK LION IN VINEGAR YARD DRURY LANE WHERE SECRETLY HE DID BUSINESS AS ONE OF THE MOST DARING AND SUCCESSFUL FENCERS EVER KNOWN IN THE METROPOLIS
LJ012-0156 HIS ARREST AND CONVICTION CAST DISMAY OVER THE WHOLE GANG OF RECEIVERS AND FOR A TIME SERIOUSLY CHECKED THE NEFARIOUS TRAFFIC
LJ012-0157 IT MAY BE ADDED THAT PRISON LIFE DID NOT AGREE WITH MONEY MOSES A STRIKING CHANGE CAME OVER HIS APPEARANCE WHILE IN NEWGATE
LJ012-0158 BEFORE HIS CONFINEMENT HE HAD BEEN A SLEEK ROUND PERSON ADDICTED OBVIOUSLY TO THE PLEASURES OF THE TABLE
LJ012-0159 HE DID NOT THRIVE ON PRISON FARE
LJ012-0160 NOW MORE STRICTLY MEAGER THANKS TO THE INSPECTORS AND THE MORE STRINGENT DISCIPLINE AND BEFORE HE EMBARKED FOR AUSTRALIA TO UNDERGO HIS FOURTEEN YEARS
LJ012-0161 HE WAS REPORTED TO HAVE FALLEN AWAY TO A SHADOW
LJ012-0162 HAVING BROUGHT DOWN THE RECORDS OF GREAT FRAUDS FORGERIES AND THEFTS FROM ABOUT 1825 TO 1840
LJ012-0163 I WILL NOW RETRACE MY STEPS AND GIVE SOME ACCOUNT OF THE MORE REMARKABLE MURDERS DURING THAT PERIOD
LJ012-0164 NO MURDER HAS CREATED GREATER SENSATION AND HORROR THROUGHOUT ENGLAND THAN THAT OF MR. WEARE BY THURTELL HUNT AND PROBERT
LJ012-0165 AS THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED BEYOND THE LIMITS OF THE METROPOLIS AND ITS PERPETRATORS ARRAIGNED AT HERTFORD
LJ012-0166 WHERE THE PRINCIPAL ACTOR SUFFERED DEATH THE CASE HARDLY COMES WITHIN THE LIMITS OF MY SUBJECT
LJ012-0167 BUT PROBERT WHO TURNED KING'S EVIDENCE AND MATERIALLY ASSISTED CONVICTION
LJ012-0168 WAS TRIED AT THE OLD BAILEY THE FOLLOWING YEAR FOR HORSESTEALING AND HANGED IN FRONT OF NEWGATE
LJ012-0169 THE MURDER WAS STILL FRESH IN THE MEMORY OF THE POPULACE AND PROBERT WAS ALL BUT LYNCHED ON HIS WAY TO JAIL
LJ012-0170 ACCORDING TO HIS STATEMENT WHEN SENTENCED TO DEATH HE HAD BEEN DRIVEN TO HORSESTEALING BY THE EXECRATION WHICH HAD PURSUED HIM AFTER THE MURDER
LJ012-0171 EVERY DOOR HAD BEEN CLOSED AGAINST HIM EVERY HOPE OF FUTURE SUPPORT BLASTED
LJ012-0172 SINCE THE CALAMITOUS EVENT HE WENT ON THAT HAPPENED AT HERTFORD I HAVE BEEN A LOST MAN
LJ012-0173 THE EVENT WHICH HE STYLES CALAMITOUS WE MAY WELL CHARACTERIZE AS ONE OF THE MOST DELIBERATELY ATROCIOUS MURDERS ON RECORD
LJ012-0174 THURTELL WAS A GAMBLER AND WEARE HAD WON A GOOD DEAL OF MONEY FROM HIM
LJ012-0175 WEARE WAS SUPPOSED TO CARRY A PRIVATE BANK ABOUT WITH HIM IN A POCKET IN HIS UNDER WAISTCOAT
LJ012-0176 TO OBTAIN POSSESSION OF THIS THURTELL WITH HIS TWO ASSOCIATES RESOLVED TO KILL HIM
LJ012-0177 THE VICTIM WAS INVITED TO VISIT PROBERT'S COTTAGE IN THE COUNTRY NEAR ELSTREE
LJ012-0178 THURTELL DROVE HIM DOWN IN A GIG TO BE KILLED AS HE TRAVELED IN THURTELL'S OWN WORDS
LJ012-0179 THE OTHERS FOLLOWED AND ON OVERTAKING THURTELL FOUND HE HAD DONE THE JOB ALONE IN A RETIRED PART OF THE ROAD KNOWN AS GILL'S HILL LANE
LJ012-0180 THE MURDERER EXPLAINED THAT HE HAD FIRST FIRED A PISTOL AT WEARE'S HEAD BUT THE SHOT GLANCED OFF HIS CHEEK
LJ012-0181 THEN HE ATTACKED THE OTHER'S THROAT WITH A PENKNIFE AND LAST OF ALL DROVE THE PISTOL BARREL INTO HIS FOREHEAD
LJ012-0182 AFTER THE MURDER THE VILLAINS DIVIDED THE SPOIL AND WENT ON TO PROBERT'S COTTAGE AND SUPPED OFF PORKCHOPS BROUGHT DOWN ON PURPOSE
LJ012-0183 DURING THE NIGHT THEY SOUGHT TO DISPOSE OF THE BODY BY THROWING IT INTO A POND BUT TWO DAYS LATER HAD TO THROW IT INTO ANOTHER POND
LJ012-0184 MEANWHILE THE DISCOVERY OF PISTOL AND KNIFE SPATTERED WITH HUMAN BLOOD AND BRAINS
LJ012-0185 RAISED THE ALARM AND SUSPICION FELL UPON THE THREE MURDERERS WHO WERE ARRESTED
LJ012-0186 THE CRIME WAS BROUGHT HOME TO THURTELL BY THE CONFESSION OF HUNT
LJ012-0187 ONE OF HIS ACCOMPLICES WHO TOOK THE POLICE TO THE POND WHERE THE REMAINS OF THE UNFORTUNATE MR. WEARE WERE DISCOVERED SUNK IN A SACK WEIGHTED BY STONES
LJ012-0188 PROBERT WAS THEN ADMITTED AS A WITNESS AND THE CASE WAS FULLY PROVED AGAINST THURTELL WHO WAS HANGED IN FRONT OF HERTFORD JAIL
LJ012-0189 HUNT IN CONSIDERATION OF THE INFORMATION HE HAD GIVEN ESCAPED DEATH AND WAS SENTENCED TO TRANSPORTATION FOR LIFE
LJ012-0190 WIDESPREAD HORROR AND INDIGNATION WAS EVOKED THROUGHOUT THE KINGDOM BY THE DISCOVERY OF THE SERIES
LJ012-0191 OF ATROCIOUS MURDERS PERPETRATED IN EDINBURGH BY THE MISCREANTS BURKE AND HARE
LJ012-0192 THE FIRST OF WHOM HAS ADDED TO THE BRITISH LANGUAGE A SYNONYM FOR ILLEGAL SUPPRESSION
LJ012-0193 THE CRIMES OF THESE INHUMAN PURVEYORS TO MEDICAL SCIENCE DO NOT FALL WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THIS WORK
LJ012-0194 BUT BURKE AND HARE HAD THEIR IMITATORS FURTHER SOUTH
LJ012-0195 AND OF THESE BISHOP AND WILLIAMS WHO WERE GUILTY OF MANY PECULIAR ATROCITIES ENDED THEIR MURDEROUS CAREERS IN FRONT OF THE DEBTORS' DOOR AT NEWGATE
LJ012-0196 BISHOP WHOSE REAL NAME WAS HEAD MARRIED A HALFSISTER OF WILLIAMS'. WILLIAMS WAS A PROFESSIONAL RESURRECTIONIST OR BODYSNATCHER
LJ012-0197 A TRADE ALMOST OPENLY COUNTENANCED WHEN SUBJECTS FOR THE ANATOMY SCHOOLS WERE ONLY TO BE GOT BY RIFLING GRAVES OR WORSE
LJ012-0198 BISHOP WAS A CARPENTER BUT HAVING BEEN SUDDENLY THROWN OUT OF WORK HE JOINED HIS BROTHERINLAW IN HIS LINE OF BUSINESS
LJ012-0199 AFTER A LITTLE
LJ012-0200 BISHOP GOT WEARY OF THE DANGERS AND FATIGUES OF EXHUMATION AND PROPOSED TO WILLIAMS THAT INSTEAD OF DISINTERRING THEY SHOULD MURDER THEIR SUBJECTS
LJ012-0201 BISHOP CONFESSED THAT HE WAS MOVED TO THIS BY THE EXAMPLE OF BURKE AND HARE
LJ012-0202 THEY PURSUED THEIR TERRIBLE TRADE FOR FIVE YEARS WITHOUT SCRUPLE AND WITHOUT DETECTION
LJ012-0203 EVENTUALLY THE LAW OVERTOOK THEM BUT ALMOST BY ACCIDENT
LJ012-0204 THEY PRESENTED THEMSELVES ABOUT NOON ONE DAY AT THE DISSECTING ROOM OF KING'S COLLEGE HOSPITAL ACCOMPANIED BY A THIRD MAN
LJ012-0205 AN AVOWED SNATCHER AND HABITUÉ OF THE FORTUNE OF WAR A PUBLICHOUSE IN SMITHFIELD FREQUENTED OPENLY BY MEN OF THIS AWFUL PROFESSION
LJ012-0206 THIS MAN MAY ASKED THE PORTER AT KING'S COLLEGE IF HE WANTED ANYTHING THE EUPHEMISM FOR OFFERING A BODY
LJ012-0207 THE PORTER ASKED WHAT HE HAD GOT AND THE ANSWER WAS A MALE SUBJECT
LJ012-0208 REFERENCE WAS MADE TO MR. PARTRIDGE THE DEMONSTRATOR IN ANATOMY
LJ012-0209 AND AFTER SOME HAGGLING THEY AGREED ON A PRICE AND IN THE AFTERNOON THE SNATCHERS BROUGHT A HAMPER WHICH CONTAINED A BODY IN A SACK
LJ012-0210 THE PORTER RECEIVED IT BUT FROM ITS FRESHNESS BECAME SUSPICIOUS OF FOUL PLAY
LJ012-0211 MR. PARTRIDGE WAS SENT FOR AND HE WITH SOME OF THE STUDENTS SOON DECIDED THAT THE CORPSE HAD NOT DIED A NATURAL DEATH
LJ012-0212 THE SNATCHERS WERE DETAINED THE POLICE SENT FOR AND ARREST FOLLOWED AS A MATTER OF COURSE
LJ012-0213 AN INQUEST WAS HELD ON THE BODY WHICH WAS IDENTIFIED AS THAT OF AN ITALIAN BOY
LJ012-0214 CARLO FERRARI WHO MADE A LIVING BY EXHIBITING WHITE MICE ABOUT THE STREETS
LJ012-0215 AND THE JURY RETURNED A VERDICT OF WILLFUL MURDER AGAINST PERSONS UNKNOWN EXPRESSING A STRONG OPINION THAT BISHOP
LJ012-0216 WILLIAMS AND MAY HAD BEEN CONCERNED IN THE TRANSACTION
LJ012-0217 MEANWHILE A SEARCH HAD BEEN MADE AT NOVA SCOTIA GARDENS BETHNAL GREEN WHERE BISHOP AND WILLIAMS LIVED
LJ012-0218 AT FIRST NOTHING PECULIAR WAS FOUND BUT AT A SECOND SEARCH THE BACKGARDEN GROUND WAS DUG UP
LJ012-0219 AND IN ONE CORNER AT SOME DEPTH A BUNDLE OF CLOTHES WERE UNEARTHED WHICH WITH A HAIRY CAP
LJ012-0220 WERE KNOWN TO BE WHAT FERRARI HAD WORN WHEN LAST SEEN
LJ012-0221 IN ANOTHER PORTION OF THE GARDEN MORE CLOTHING PARTLY MALE AND PARTLY FEMALE WAS DISCOVERED
LJ012-0222 PLAINLY POINTING TO THE PERPETRATION OF OTHER CRIMES
LJ012-0223 THESE FACTS WERE REPRESENTED BEFORE THE POLICE MAGISTRATE
LJ012-0224 WHO EXAMINED BISHOP AND HIS FELLOWS AND FURTHER INCRIMINATING EVIDENCE ADDUCED TO THE EFFECT THAT THE PRISONERS HAD BARTERED FOR A COACH TO CARRY A STIFF 'UN
LJ012-0225 THEY HAD ALSO BEEN SEEN TO LEAVE THEIR COTTAGE CARRYING OUT A SACK WITH SOMETHING HEAVY INSIDE. ON THIS THEY WERE FULLY COMMITTED TO NEWGATE FOR TRIAL
LJ012-0226 THIS TRIAL CAME OFF IN DUE COURSE AT THE CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT WHERE THE PRISONERS WERE CHARGED ON TWO COUNTS
LJ012-0227 ONE THAT OF THE MURDER OF THE ITALIAN BOY THE OTHER THAT OF A BOY UNKNOWN
LJ012-0228 THE EVIDENCE FROM FIRST TO LAST WAS CIRCUMSTANTIAL
LJ012-0229 BUT THE JURY AFTER A SHORT DELIBERATION DID NOT HESITATE TO BRING IN A VERDICT OF GUILTY AND ALL THREE WERE CONDEMNED TO DEATH
LJ012-0230 SHORTLY BEFORE THE DAY FIXED FOR EXECUTION BISHOP MADE A FULL CONFESSION THE BULK OF WHICH BORE THE IMPRESS OF TRUTH
LJ012-0231 ALTHOUGH IT INCLUDED STATEMENTS THAT WERE IMPROBABLE AND UNSUBSTANTIATED
LJ012-0232 HE ASSERTED THAT THE VICTIM WAS A LINCOLNSHIRE LAD AND NOT AN ITALIAN BOY ALTHOUGH THE LATTER WAS FULLY PROVED
LJ012-0233 ACCORDING TO THE CONFESSION DEATH HAD BEEN INFLICTED BY DROWNING IN A WELL WHEREAS THE MEDICAL EVIDENCE ALL POINTED TO VIOLENCE
LJ012-0234 IT WAS HOWEVER PRETTY CLEAR THAT THIS VICTIM LIKE PRECEDING ONES HAD BEEN LURED TO NOVA SCOTIA GARDENS AND THERE DRUGGED WITH A LARGE DOSE OF LAUDANUM
LJ012-0235 WHILE THEY WERE IN A STATE OF INSENSIBILITY THE MURDER WAS COMMITTED
LJ012-0236 BISHOP'S CONFESSION WAS ENDORSED BY WILLIAMS AND THE IMMEDIATE RESULT WAS THE RESPITE OF MAY
LJ012-0237 A VERY PAINFUL SCENE OCCURRED IN NEWGATE WHEN THE NEWS OF HIS ESCAPE FROM DEATH WAS IMPARTED TO MAY
LJ012-0238 HE FAINTED AND THE WARRANT OF MERCY NEARLY PROVED HIS DEATHBLOW. THE OTHER TWO LOOKED ON AT HIS AGITATION WITH AN INDIFFERENCE AMOUNTING TO APATHY
LJ012-0239 THE EXECUTION TOOK PLACE A WEEK OR TWO LATER IN THE PRESENCE OF SUCH A CROWD AS HAD NOT BEEN SEEN NEAR NEWGATE FOR YEARS
LJ012-0240 I WILL CLOSE THIS CHAPTER WITH A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF ANOTHER MURDER
LJ012-0241 THE MEMORY OF WHICH IS STILL FRESH IN THE MINDS OF LONDONERS ALTHOUGH HALF A CENTURY HAS PASSED SINCE IT WAS COMMITTED
LJ012-0242 THE HORROR WITH WHICH GREENACRE'S CRIME STRUCK THE TOWN WAS UNPARALLELED SINCE THE TIME WHEN CATHERINE HAYES SLEW HER HUSBAND
LJ012-0243 THERE WERE MANY FEATURES OF RESEMBLANCE IN THESE CRIMES
LJ012-0244 THE DECAPITATION AND DISMEMBERMENT THE BESTOWAL OF THE REMAINS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE TOWN THE PRESERVATION OF THE HEAD IN SPIRITS OF WINE
LJ012-0245 IN THE HOPE THAT THE FEATURES MIGHT SOME DAY BE RECOGNIZED WERE ALIKE IN BOTH
LJ012-0246 THE MURDER IN BOTH CASES WAS LONG A PROFOUND MYSTERY. IN THIS WHICH I AM NOW DESCRIBING
LJ012-0247 A BRICKLAYER FOUND A HUMAN TRUNK NEAR SOME NEW BUILDINGS IN THE EDGEWARE ROAD ONE MORNING IN THE LAST WEEK OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY SIX
LJ012-0248 THE INQUEST ON THESE REMAINS WHICH MEDICAL EXAMINATION SHOWED TO BE THOSE OF A FEMALE
LJ012-0249 RETURNED A VERDICT OF WILLFUL MURDER AGAINST SOME PERSON UNKNOWN
LJ012-0250 ON THE SEVENTH JULY EIGHTY THIRTY SEVEN
LJ012-0251 THE LOCKMAN OF BEN JONSON LOCK IN STEPNEY FIELDS FOUND A HUMAN HEAD JAMMED INTO THE LOCK GATES
LJ012-0252 CLOSER INVESTIGATION PROVED THAT IT BELONGED TO THE TRUNK ALREADY DISCOVERED ON THE SECOND FEBRUARY
LJ012-0253 A FURTHER DISCOVERY WAS MADE IN AN OSIER BED NEAR COLD HARBOR LANE CAMBERWELL
LJ012-0254 WHERE A WORKMAN FOUND A BUNDLE CONTAINING TWO HUMAN LEGS IN A DRAIN
LJ012-0255 THESE WERE THE MISSING MEMBERS OF THE SAME MUTILATED TRUNK
LJ012-0256 AND THERE WAS NOW EVIDENCE SUFFICIENT TO ESTABLISH CONCLUSIVELY THAT THE WOMAN THUS COLLECTED PIECEMEAL HAD BEEN BARBAROUSLY DONE TO DEATH
LJ012-0257 BUT THE AFFAIR STILL REMAINED A PROFOUND MYSTERY NO LIGHT WAS THROWN UPON IT TILL TOWARDS THE END OF MARCH
LJ012-0258 A MR. GAY OF GOODGE STREET CAME TO VIEW THE HEAD AND IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IT AS THAT OF A WIDOWED SISTER HANNAH BROWN
LJ012-0259 WHO HAD BEEN MISSING SINCE THE PREVIOUS CHRISTMAS DAY
LJ012-0260 THE MURDERED INDIVIDUAL WAS THUS IDENTIFIED. THE NEXT STEP WAS TO ASCERTAIN WHERE AND WITH WHOM SHE HAD LAST BEEN SEEN
LJ012-0261 THIS BROUGHT SUSPICION ON TO A CERTAIN JAMES GREENACRE
LJ012-0262 WHOM SHE WAS TO HAVE MARRIED AND IN WHOSE COMPANY SHE HAD LEFT HER OWN LODGINGS TO VISIT HIS IN CAMBERWELL
LJ012-0263 THE POLICE WISHED TO REFER TO GREENACRE BUT AS HE WAS NOT FORTHCOMING
LJ012-0264 A WARRANT WAS ISSUED FOR HIS APPREHENSION WHICH WAS EFFECTED AT KENNINGTON ON THE 24TH MARCH
LJ012-0265 A WOMAN NAMED GALE WHO LIVED WITH HIM WAS ARRESTED AT THE SAME TIME. THE PRISONERS WERE EXAMINED AT THE MARYLEBONE POLICE COURT
LJ012-0266 GREENACRE A STOUT MIDDLEAGED MAN WRAPPED IN A BROWN GREATCOAT ASSUMED AN AIR OF INSOLENT BRAVADO
LJ012-0267 BUT HIS DESPAIR MUST HAVE BEEN GREAT AS WAS EVIDENT FROM HIS ATTEMPT TO STRANGLE HIMSELF IN THE STATIONHOUSE
LJ012-0268 SUSPICION GREW ALMOST TO CERTAINTY AS THE EVIDENCE WAS UNFOLDED
LJ012-0269 MRS. BROWN WAS A WASHERWOMAN SUPPOSED TO BE WORTH SOME MONEY HENCE GREENACRE'S OFFER OF MARRIAGE
LJ012-0270 SHE HAD REALIZED ALL HER EFFECTS AND BROUGHT THEM WITH HER FURNITURE TO GREENACRE'S LODGINGS. THE TWO WHEN MARRIED WERE TO EMIGRATE TO HUDSON'S BAY
LJ012-0271 WHETHER IT WAS GREED OR A QUARREL THAT DROVE GREENACRE TO THE DESPERATE DEED REMAINS OBSCURE
LJ012-0272 THEY WERE APPARENTLY GOOD FRIENDS WHEN LAST SEEN TOGETHER AT A NEIGHBOR'S WHERE THEY SEEMED PERFECTLY HAPPY AND SOCIABLE AND EAGER FOR THE WEDDING DAY
LJ012-0273 BUT GREENACRE IN HIS CONFESSION PRETENDED THAT HE AND HIS INTENDED HAD QUARRELED OVER HER PROPERTY OR THE WANT OF IT
LJ012-0274 AND THAT IN A MOMENT OF ANGER HE KNOCKED HER DOWN
LJ012-0275 HE THOUGHT HE HAD KILLED HER AND IN HIS TERROR BEGAN AT ONCE TO CONSIDER HOW HE MIGHT DISPOSE OF THE BODY AND ESCAPE ARREST
LJ012-0276 WHILE SHE WAS SENSELESS BUT REALLY STILL ALIVE HE CUT OFF HER HEAD AND DISMEMBERED THE BODY IN THE MANNER ALREADY DESCRIBED
LJ012-0277 IT IS SCARCELY PROBABLE THAT HE WOULD HAVE GONE TO THIS EXTREMITY IF HE HAD HAD NO PREVIOUS EVIL INTENTION
LJ012-0278 AND THE MOST PROBABLE INFERENCE IS THAT HE INVEIGLED MRS. BROWN TO HIS LODGINGS WITH THE SET PURPOSE OF TAKING HER LIFE
LJ012-0279 HIS MEASURES FOR THE DISPOSAL OF THE CORPUS DELICTI REMIND US OF THOSE TAKEN BY MRS. HAYES AND HER ASSOCIATES
LJ012-0280 OR OF GARDELLE'S FRANTIC EFFORTS TO CONCEAL HIS CRIME
LJ012-0281 THE MOST GHASTLY PART OF THE STORY IS THAT WHICH DEALS WITH HIS GETTING RID OF THE HEAD
LJ012-0282 THIS WRAPPED UP IN A SILK HANDKERCHIEF
LJ012-0283 HE CARRIED UNDER HIS COATFLAPS THROUGH THE STREETS AND AFTERWARDS ON HIS CAP IN A CROWDED CITY OMNIBUS
LJ012-0284 IT WAS NOT UNTIL HE LEFT THE BUS AND WALKED UP BY THE REGENT'S CANAL THAT HE CONCEIVED THE IDEA OF THROWING THE HEAD INTO THE WATER
LJ012-0285 ANOTHER DAY ELAPSED BEFORE HE GOT RID OF THE REST OF THE BODY
LJ012-0286 ALL OF WHICH ACCORDING TO HIS OWN CONFESSION MADE NO DOUBT WITH THE IDEA OF EXONERATING MRS. GALE HE ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT HER ASSISTANCE
LJ012-0287 ON THE OTHER HAND IT WAS ADDUCED IN EVIDENCE THAT MRS. GALE HAD BEEN AT HIS LODGINGS THE VERY DAY AFTER THE MURDER
LJ012-0288 AND WAS SEEN TO BE BUSILY ENGAGED IN WASHING DOWN THE HOUSE WITH BUCKET AND MOP
LJ012-0289 GREENACRE WHEN TRIED AT THE OLD BAILEY ADMITTED THAT HE HAD BEEN GUILTY OF MANSLAUGHTER
LJ012-0290 WHILE CONVERSING WITH MRS. BROWN HE DECLARED THE UNFORTUNATE WOMAN WAS ROCKING HERSELF TO AND FRO IN A CHAIR
LJ012-0291 AS SHE LEANT BACK HE PUT HIS FOOT AGAINST THE CHAIR AND SO TILTED IT OVER
LJ012-0292 MRS. BROWN FELL WITH IT AND GREENACRE TO HIS HORROR FOUND THAT SHE WAS DEAD
LJ012-0293 BUT THE MEDICAL EVIDENCE WAS CLEAR THAT THE DECAPITATION HAD BEEN EFFECTED DURING LIFE AND THE JURY AFTER A SHORT DELIBERATION
LJ012-0294 WITHOUT HESITATION BROUGHT IN A VERDICT OF WILLFUL MURDER
LJ012-0295 THE WOMAN GALE WAS ALSO FOUND GUILTY BUT SENTENCE OF DEATH WAS ONLY PASSED ON GREENACRE
LJ012-0296 THE EXECUTION WAS AS USUAL ATTENDED BY AN IMMENSE CONCOURSE AND GREENACRE DIED AMIDST THE LOUDEST EXECRATIONS
LJ013-0001 THE CHRONICLES OF NEWGATE VOLUME 2. BY ARTHUR GRIFFITHS. SECTION 16 NEWGATE NOTORIETIES CONTINUED PART 1
LJ013-0002 AS THE CENTURY ADVANCED CRIMES OF FRAUD INCREASED
LJ013-0003 THEY NOT ONLY BECAME MORE NUMEROUS BUT THEY WERE ON A WIDER SCALE
LJ013-0004 THE MOST EXTENSIVE AND SYSTEMATIC ROBBERIES WERE PLANNED AND CARRIED OUT SO AS LONG TO ESCAPE DETECTION
LJ013-0005 ONE OF THE EARLIEST OF THE BIG OPERATORS IN FRAUDULENT FINANCE WAS EDWARD BEAUMONT SMITH
LJ013-0006 WHO WAS CONVICTED IN 1841 OF UTTERING FALSE EXCHEQUER BILLS TO AN ALMOST FABULOUS AMOUNT
LJ013-0007 A NOT ENTIRELY NOVEL KIND OF FRAUD BUT ONE CARRIED OUT ON A LARGER SCALE THAN HERETOFORE
LJ013-0008 CAME TO LIGHT IN THIS SAME YEAR 1841
LJ013-0009 THIS WAS THE WILLFUL SHIPWRECK AND CASTING AWAY OF A VESSEL WHICH WITH HER SUPPOSED CARGO HAD BEEN HEAVILY INSURED
LJ013-0010 THE DRYAD WAS A BRIG OWNED PRINCIPALLY BY TWO PERSONS NAMED WALLACE ONE A SEAMAN THE OTHER MERCHANT
LJ013-0011 SHE WAS FREIGHTED BY THE FIRM OF ZULUETA AND CO. FOR A VOYAGE TO SANTA CRUZ
LJ013-0012 HER OWNERS INSURED HER FOR A FULL SUM OF £2000 AFTER WHICH THE WALLACES INSURED HER PRIVILY
LJ013-0013 WITH OTHER UNDERWRITERS FOR A SECOND SUM OF £2000
LJ013-0014 AFTER THIS ON THE FAITH OF FORCED BILLS OF LADING THE CAPTAIN LOOSE BY NAME
LJ013-0015 BEING A PARTY TO THE INTENDED FRAUD THEY OBTAINED FURTHER INSURANCES ON GOODS NEVER SHIPPED
LJ013-0016 IT WAS FULLY PROVED IN EVIDENCE THAT WHEN THE DRYAD SAILED SHE CARRIED NOTHING BUT THE CARGO BELONGING TO ZULUETA AND CO
LJ013-0017 YET THE WALLACES PRETENDED TO HAVE PUT ON BOARD QUANTITIES OF FLANNELS CLOTHS COTTON PRINTS
LJ013-0018 BEEF PORK BUTTER AND EARTHENWARES ON ALL OF WHICH THEY EFFECTED INSURANCES
LJ013-0019 LOOSE HAD HIS INSTRUCTIONS TO CAST AWAY THE SHIP ON THE FIRST POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY AND FROM THE TIME OF HIS LEAVING LIVERPOOL
LJ013-0020 HE ACTED IN A MANNER WHICH EXCITED THE SUSPICIONS OF THE CREW
LJ013-0021 THE LARBOARD PUMP WAS SUFFERED TO REMAIN CHOKED UP AND THE LONGBOAT WAS FITTED WITH TACKLES AND HELD READY FOR USE AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE
LJ013-0022 THE SHIP HOWEVER MET WITH EXASPERATINGLY FINE WEATHER AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE CAPTAIN REACHED THE WEST INDIA ISLANDS
LJ013-0023 THAT HE GOT A CHANCE OF ACCOMPLISHING HIS CRIME
LJ013-0024 AT A PLACE CALLED THE SILVER KEYS HE RAN THE SHIP ON THE REEF
LJ013-0025 BUT ANOTHER SHIP CONCLUDING THAT HE WAS ACTING IN IGNORANCE RENDERED HIM ASSISTANCE
LJ013-0026 THE 'DRYAD' WAS GOT OFF REPAIRED AND HER VOYAGE RENEWED TO SANTA CRUZ
LJ013-0027 HE CREPT ALONG THE COAST CLOSE IN SHORE LOOKING FOR A QUIET SPOT TO CAST AWAY THE SHIP
LJ013-0028 AND AT LAST WHEN WITHIN FIFTEEN MILES OF PORT WITH WIND AND WEATHER PERFECTLY FAIR HE RAN HER ON TO THE ROCKS
LJ013-0029 EVEN THEN SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SAVED BUT THE CAPTAIN WOULD NOT SUFFER THE CREW TO ACT. NEARLY THE WHOLE OF THE CARGO WAS LOST AS WELL AS THE SHIP
LJ013-0030 THE CAPTAIN AND CREW HOWEVER GOT SAFELY TO JAMAICA AND SO TO ENGLAND THE CAPTAIN DYING ON THE VOYAGE HOME
LJ013-0031 THE CRIME SOON BECAME PUBLIC
LJ013-0032 MATE CARPENTER AND CREW WERE EAGER TO DISAVOW COMPLICITY AND VOLUNTARILY GAVE INFORMATION
LJ013-0033 THE WALLACES WERE ARRESTED COMMITTED TO NEWGATE AND TRIED AT THE OLD BAILEY
LJ013-0034 THE CASE WAS CLEARLY PROVED AGAINST THEM AND BOTH WERE SENTENCED TO TRANSPORTATION FOR LIFE
LJ013-0035 WHILE LYING IN NEWGATE AWAITING REMOVAL TO THE CONVICT SHIP BOTH PRISONERS MADE FULL CONFESSIONS
LJ013-0036 ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN STATEMENTS THE LOSS OF THE 'DRYAD' WAS ONLY ONE OF SIX INTENTIONAL SHIPWRECKS WITH WHICH THEY HAD BEEN CONCERNED
LJ013-0037 THE CRIME OF FRAUDULENT INSURANCE THEY DECLARED WAS VERY COMMON AND THE UNDERWRITERS MUST HAVE LOST GREAT SUMS IN THIS WAY
LJ013-0038 THE MERCHANT WALLACE SAID HE HAD BEEN LED INTO THE CRIME BY THE ADVICE AND EXAMPLE OF A CITY FRIEND WHO HAD GONE LARGELY INTO THIS NEFARIOUS BUSINESS
LJ013-0039 THIS WALLACE ADDED THAT HIS FRIEND HAD MADE SEVERAL VOYAGES WITH THE DISTINCT INTENTION OF SUPERINTENDING THE PREDETERMINED SHIPWRECKS
LJ013-0040 THE OTHER WALLACE THE SAILOR ALSO TRACED HIS LAPSE INTO CRIME TO EVIL COUNSEL
LJ013-0041 HE WAS AN HONEST SEACAPTAIN HE SAID TRADING FROM LIVERPOOL WHERE ONCE HE HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO BE INTRODUCED TO A MAN OF WEALTH
LJ013-0042 THE FOUNDATIONS OF WHICH HAD BEEN LAID BY BUYING OLD SHIPS ON PURPOSE TO CAST THEM AWAY
LJ013-0043 THIS PERSON MADE MUCH OF WALLACE ENCOURAGED HIS ATTENTIONS TO HIS DAUGHTER
LJ013-0044 AND TEMPTED HIM TO TAKE TO FRAUDULENT INSURANCE AS A CERTAIN METHOD OF ACHIEVING FORTUNE
LJ013-0045 WALLACE'S RELATIONS WARNED HIM AGAINST HIS LIVERPOOL FRIEND
LJ013-0046 BUT HE WOULD NOT TAKE THEIR ADVICE AND DEVELOPING HIS TRANSACTIONS ENDED AS WE HAVE SEEN
LJ013-0047 A CLERGYMAN NEARLY A CENTURY LATER FOLLOWED IN THE STEPS OF DR. DODD BUT DID NOT UNDER MORE HUMANE LAWS LOSE HIS LIFE
LJ013-0048 THE REV. W. BAILEY LL.D. WAS CONVICTED AT THE CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT IN FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN FOURTY THREE OF FORGERY
LJ013-0049 A NOTORIOUS MISER ROBERT SMITH HAD RECENTLY DIED IN SEVEN DIALS WHERE HE HAD AMASSED A CONSIDERABLE FORTUNE
LJ013-0050 BUT AMONG THE CHARGES ON THE ESTATE HE LEFT
LJ013-0051 WAS A PROMISSORY NOTE FOR £2875 PRODUCED BY DR. BAILEY AND PURPORTING TO BE SIGNED BY SMITH
LJ013-0052 THE EXECUTORS TO THE ESTATE DISPUTED THE VALIDITY OF THIS DOCUMENT
LJ013-0053 MISS BAILEY THE DOCTOR'S SISTER IN WHOSE FAVOR THE NOTE WAS SAID TO HAVE BEEN GIVEN
LJ013-0054 THEN BROUGHT AN ACTION AGAINST THE ADMINISTRATORS AND AT THE TRIAL DR. BAILEY SWORE THAT THE NOTE HAD BEEN GIVEN HIM BY SMITH
LJ013-0055 THE JURY DID NOT BELIEVE HIM AND THE VERDICT WAS FOR THE DEFENDANTS
LJ013-0056 SUBSEQUENTLY BAILEY WAS ARRESTED ON A CHARGE OF FORGERY AND AFTER A LONG TRIAL FOUND GUILTY. HIS SENTENCE WAS TRANSPORTATION FOR LIFE
LJ013-0057 A GIGANTIC CONSPIRACY TO DEFRAUD WAS DISCOVERED IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR WHEN A SOLICITOR NAMED WILLIAM HENRY BARBER
LJ013-0058 JOSHUA FLETCHER A SURGEON AND THREE OTHERS WERE CHARGED WITH FORGING WILLS FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBTAINING UNCLAIMED STOCK IN THE FUNDS
LJ013-0059 THERE WERE TWO SEPARATE AFFAIRS
LJ013-0060 IN THE FIRST A MAIDEN LADY MISS SLACK
LJ013-0061 WHO WAS THE POSSESSOR OF TWO SEPARATE SUMS IN CONSOLS NEGLECTED THROUGH STRANGE CARELESSNESS ON HER OWN PART AND THAT OF HER FRIENDS
LJ013-0062 TO DRAW THE DIVIDENDS ON MORE THAN ONE SUM
LJ013-0063 THE OTHER REMAINING UNCLAIMED FOR TEN YEARS WAS TRANSFERRED AT THE END OF THAT TIME TO THE COMMISSIONERS FOR THE REDUCTION OF THE NATIONAL DEBT
LJ013-0064 BARBER IT WAS SAID BECAME AWARE OF THIS
LJ013-0065 AND THAT HE GAINED ACCESS TO MISS SLACK ON PRETENSE OF CONVEYING TO HER SOME FUNDED PROPERTY LEFT HER BY AN AUNT
LJ013-0066 BY THIS MEANS HER SIGNATURE WAS OBTAINED A FORGED WILL WAS PREPARED BEQUEATHING THE UNCLAIMED STOCK TO MISS SLACK
LJ013-0067 A NOTE PURPORTING TO BE FROM MISS SLACK WAS ADDRESSED TO THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND BEGGING THAT THE SAID STOCK MIGHT BE HANDED OVER TO HER
LJ013-0068 AND A PERSON CALLING HERSELF MISS SLACK DULY ATTENDED AT THE BANK WHERE THE MONEY WAS HANDED OVER TO HER IN PROPER FORM
LJ013-0069 A SECOND WILL ALSO FORGED WAS PROPOUNDED AT DOCTORS COMMONS AS THAT OF A MRS. HUNT OF BRISTOL
LJ013-0070 MRS. HUNT HAD LEFT MONEY IN THE FUNDS WHICH REMAINED UNCLAIMED AND HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED AS IN MISS SLACK'S CASE
LJ013-0071 HERE AGAIN THE MONEY WITH TEN YEARS' INTEREST WAS HANDED OVER TO BARBER AND ANOTHER CALLING HIMSELF THOMAS HUNT AN EXECUTOR OF THE WILL
LJ013-0072 IT WAS SHOWN THAT THE WILL MUST BE A FORGERY
LJ013-0073 AS ITS SIGNATURE WAS DATED EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINE WHEREAS MRS. HUNT ACTUALLY DIED IN 1806
LJ013-0074 A THIRD SIMILAR FRAUD TO THE AMOUNT OF TWO THOUSAND POUNDS WAS ALSO BROUGHT TO LIGHT
LJ013-0075 FLETCHER WAS THE MOVING SPIRIT OF THE WHOLE BUSINESS IT WAS HE WHO HAD INTRODUCED BARBER TO MISS SLACK
LJ013-0076 AND HELD ALL THE THREADS OF THESE INTRICATE AND NEFARIOUS TRANSACTIONS
LJ013-0077 BARBER AND FLETCHER WERE BOTH TRANSPORTED FOR LIFE ALTHOUGH FLETCHER DECLARED THAT BARBER WAS INNOCENT AND HAD NO GUILTY KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT WAS BEING DONE
LJ013-0078 BARBER WAS SUBSEQUENTLY PARDONED BUT WAS NOT REPLACED ON THE ROLLS AS AN ATTORNEY TILL 1855
LJ013-0079 WHEN LORD CAMPBELL DELIVERED JUDGMENT ON BARBER'S PETITION TO THE EFFECT THAT
LJ013-0080 THE EVIDENCE TO ESTABLISH HIS BARBER'S CONNIVANCE IN THE FRAUDS WAS TOO DOUBTFUL FOR US TO CONTINUE HIS EXCLUSION ANY LONGER
LJ013-0081 BANKS AND BANKERS CONTINUED TO BE VICTIMIZED
LJ013-0082 IN EIGHTEEN FORTY FOUR
LJ013-0083 THE BANK OF ENGLAND WAS DEFRAUDED OF A SUM OF EIGHT THOUSAND POUNDS BY ONE OF ITS CLERKS BURGESS IN CONJUNCTION WITH AN ACCOMPLICE NAMED ELDER
LJ013-0084 BURGESS FRAUDULENTLY TRANSFERRED CONSOLS TO THE ABOVE AMOUNT STANDING IN THE NAME OF MR. OXENFORD TO ANOTHER PARTY
LJ013-0085 A PERSON ELDER OF COURSE WHO PERSONATED OXENFORD ATTENDED AT THE BANK TO COMPLETE THE TRANSFER AND SELL THE STOCK
LJ013-0086 BURGESS WHO WAS PURPOSELY ON LEAVE FROM THE BANK EFFECTED THE SALE WHICH WAS PAID FOR WITH A CHEQUE FOR NEARLY THE WHOLE AMOUNT ON LUBBOCK'S BANK
LJ013-0087 BURGESS AND ELDER PROCEEDED IN COMPANY TO CASH THIS BUT AS THEY WANTED ALL GOLD
LJ013-0088 THE CASHIER GAVE THEM EIGHT BANK OF ENGLAND NOTES FOR £1000 EACH SAYING THAT THEY COULD GET SO MUCH SPECIE NOWHERE ELSE
LJ013-0089 THITHER ELDER WENT ALONE PROVIDED WITH A NUMBER OF CANVAS AND ONE LARGE CARPETBAG
LJ013-0090 BUT WHEN THE LATTER WAS FILLED WITH GOLD IT WAS TOO HEAVY TO LIFT
LJ013-0091 AND ELDER HAD TO BE ASSISTED BY TWO BANK PORTERS WHO CARRIED IT FOR HIM TO A CARRIAGE WAITING NEAR THE MANSION HOUSE
LJ013-0092 THE THIEVES FOR ELDER WAS SOON JOINED BY BURGESS DROVE TOGETHER TO BEN CAUNT'S THE PUGILIST'S PUBLICHOUSE IN ST. MARTIN'S LANE
LJ013-0093 WHERE THE CASH WAS TRANSFERRED FROM THE CARPETBAG TO A PORTMANTEAU
LJ013-0094 THE SAME EVENING BOTH STARTED FOR LIVERPOOL AND EMBARKING ON BOARD THE MAIL STEAMER BRITANNIA ESCAPED TO THE UNITED STATES
LJ013-0095 BURGESS' CONTINUED ABSENCE WAS SOON NOTICED AT THE BANK
LJ013-0096 SUSPICIONS WERE AROUSED WHEN IT WAS FOUND THAT HE HAD BEEN EMPLOYED IN SELLING STOCK FOR MR. OXENFORD WHICH DEVELOPED INTO CERTAINTY
LJ013-0097 AS SOON AS THAT GENTLEMAN WAS REFERRED TO
LJ013-0098 MR. OXENFORD HAVING DENIED THAT HE HAD MADE ANY TRANSFER OF STOCK THE MATTER WAS AT ONCE PUT INTO THE HANDS OF THE POLICE
LJ013-0099 A SMART DETECTIVE FORRESTER AFTER A LITTLE INQUIRY
LJ013-0100 ESTABLISHED THE FACT THAT THE MAN WHO HAD PERSONATED MR. OXENFORD WAS A HORSEDEALER NAMED JOSEPH ELDER AN INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE OF BURGESS'
LJ013-0101 FORRESTER NEXT TRACED THE FUGITIVES TO LIVERPOOL
LJ013-0102 AND THENCE TO HALIFAX WHITHER HE FOLLOWED THEM ACCOMPANIED BY A CONFIDENTIAL CLERK FROM THE BANK
LJ013-0103 AT HALIFAX FORRESTER LEARNT THAT THE MEN HE WANTED HAD GONE ON TO BOSTON THENCE TO BUFFALO AND CANADA AND BACK TO BOSTON
LJ013-0104 HE FOUND THEM AT LENGTH RESIDING AT THE LATTER PLACE ONE AS A LANDED PROPRIETOR THE OTHER AS A PUBLICAN
LJ013-0105 ELDER THE FORMER WAS SOON APPREHENDED AT HIS HOUSE BUT HE EVADED THE LAW BY HANGING HIMSELF WITH HIS POCKETHANDKERCHIEF
LJ013-0106 THE INN BELONGING TO BURGESS WAS SURROUNDED
LJ013-0107 BUT HE ESCAPED THROUGH A BACK DOOR ON TO THE RIVER AND ROWED OFF IN A BOAT TO A HIDINGPLACE IN THE WOODS
LJ013-0108 NEXT DAY A PERSON BETRAYED HIM FOR THE REWARD AND HE WAS SOON CAPTURED
LJ013-0109 THE PROCEEDS OF THE ROBBERY WERE LODGED IN A BOSTON BANK
LJ013-0110 BUT FOUR HUNDRED SOVEREIGNS WERE FOUND ON ELDER WHILE TWO HUNDRED MORE WERE FOUND IN BURGESS' EFFECTS
LJ013-0111 BURGESS WAS EVENTUALLY BROUGHT BACK TO ENGLAND TRIED AT THE CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT AND SENTENCED TO TRANSPORTATION FOR LIFE
LJ013-0112 WITHIN A MONTH OR TWO THE BANK OF MESSRS. ROGERS AND CO. CLEMENT'S LANE WAS BROKEN INTO
LJ013-0113 ROBBERIES AS DARING IN CONCEPTION AS THEY WERE BOLDLY EXECUTED WERE COMMON ENOUGH
LJ013-0114 ONE NIGHT A QUANTITY OF PLATE WAS STOLEN FROM WINDSOR CASTLE ANOTHER TIME BUCKINGHAM PALACE WAS ROBBED
LJ013-0115 OF THIS CLASS WAS THE INGENIOUS YET PECULIARLY SIMPLE ROBBERY EFFECTED AT THE HOUSE OF LORD FITZGERALD IN BELGRAVE SQUARE
LJ013-0116 THE BUTLER ON THE OCCASION OF A DEATH IN THE FAMILY WHEN THE HOUSE WAS IN SOME CONFUSION ARRANGED WITH A BURGLAR TO COME IN
LJ013-0117 AND WITH ANOTHER CARRY OFF THE PLATECHEST IN BROAD DAYLIGHT AND AS A MATTER OF BUSINESS. NO ONE INTERFERED OR ASKED ANY QUESTIONS
LJ013-0118 THE THIEF WALKED INTO THE HOUSE IN BELGRAVE SQUARE AND OPENLY CARRIED OFF THE PLATECHEST DEPOSITED IT IN A LIGHT CART AT THE DOOR AND DROVE AWAY
LJ013-0119 HOWSE THE STEWARD ACCUSED THE OTHER SERVANTS BUT THEY RETORTED DECLARING THAT HE HAD BEEN VISITED BY THE THIEF THE DAY PREVIOUS
LJ013-0120 WHOM HE HAD SHOWN OVER THE PLATE CLOSET
LJ013-0121 HOWSE AND HIS ACCOMPLICE WERE ARRESTED THE FORMER WAS FOUND GUILTY AND SENTENCED TO FIFTEEN YEARS BUT THE LATTER WAS ACQUITTED
LJ013-0122 STEALING PLATE WAS ABOUT THIS PERIOD THE CRIME OF A MORE ARISTOCRATIC THIEF
LJ013-0123 THE CLUB SPOONS AND OTHER ARTICLES OF PLATE WERE LONG A SOURCE OF PROFITABLE INCOME TO A GENTLEMAN NAMED ASHLEY
LJ013-0124 WHO BELONGED TO FIVE GOOD LONDON CLUBS 
LJ013-0125 THE JUNIOR UNITED SERVICE THE UNION REFORM COLONIAL AND ERECHTHEUM CLUBS
LJ013-0126 WHEN ONE OF THESE CLUBS WAS TAKEN IN AT THE ARMY AND NAVY THAT ESTABLISHMENT ALSO SUFFERED
LJ013-0127 SUSPICION FELL AT LENGTH UPON ASHLEY WHO WAS SEEN TO HANDLE THE FORKS AND SPOONS AT TABLE IN A STRANGE MANNER
LJ013-0128 A WATCH WAS SET ON HIS HOUSE IN ALLINGTON STREET PIMLICO
LJ013-0129 AND ONE DAY A POLICE CONSTABLE TRACKED HIM TO A SILVERSMITH'S IN HOLBORN HILL
LJ013-0130 WHERE ASHLEY PRODUCED FOUR SILVER SPOONS AND BEGGED THAT HIS INITIALS MIGHT BE ENGRAVED UPON THEM
LJ013-0131 ASHLEY WAS ARRESTED AS HE LEFT THE SHOP THE SPOONS WERE IMPOUNDED AND IT WAS FOUND THAT THE CLUB MONOGRAM HAD BEEN ERASED FROM THEM
LJ013-0132 ON A SEARCH OF THE PRISONER'S LODGINGS IN ALLINGTON STREET A SILVER FORK WAS FOUND
LJ013-0133 A NUMBER OF PAWNBROKERS' DUPLICATES AND THREE SMALL FILES. IT WAS PROVED AT THE TRIAL THAT ASHLEY HAD ASKED HIS LANDLADY FOR BRICKDUST AND LEATHER
LJ013-0134 AND IT WAS CONTENDED THAT THESE WITH THE FILES WERE USED TO ALTER THE MARKS ON THE PLATE
LJ013-0135 AT MOST OF THE CLUBS THE SERVANTS HAD BEEN MULCTED TO MAKE GOOD LOST PLATE WHICH HAD NO DOUBT BEEN STOLEN BY THE PRISONER
LJ013-0136 SEVERAL PAWNBROKERS WERE SUBPOENAED AND OBLIGED TO SURRENDER PLATE TO THE EXTENT IN SOME CASES OF A COUPLE OF DOZEN OF SPOONS OR FORKS
LJ013-0137 WHICH THE VARIOUS CLUB SECRETARIES IDENTIFIED AS THE PROPERTY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE CLUBS
LJ013-0138 ASHLEY WAS THE SON OF AN ARMY AGENT AND BANKER
LJ013-0139 AND MANY WITNESSES WERE BROUGHT TO ATTEST TO HIS PREVIOUS GOOD CHARACTER BUT HE WAS FOUND GUILTY AND SENTENCED TO SEVEN YEARS' TRANSPORTATION
LJ013-0140 A ROBBERY OF A SOMEWHAT NOVEL KIND WAS EXECUTED IN RATHER A BUNGLING FASHION BY KER A SEACAPTAIN
LJ013-0141 WHOSE SHIP BROUGHT HOME A MIXED CARGO FROM BAHIA AND OTHER PORTS
LJ013-0142 PART OF THE FREIGHT WERE FOUR HUNDRED ROUGH DIAMONDS VALUED AT £4000
LJ013-0143 THESE PACKAGES WERE CONSIGNED TO MESSRS. SHROEDER OF LONDON AND AS IT WAS KNOWN THAT THEY WERE TO ARRIVE IN KER'S SHIP
LJ013-0144 ONE OF THE OWNERS HAD MET HER AT DEAL BUT THE CAPTAIN HAD ALREADY ABSCONDED WITH THE PACKAGES OF PRECIOUS STONES IN HIS POCKET
LJ013-0145 KER CAME AT ONCE TO LONDON AND BY THE HELP OF THE LANDLORD OF A PUBLICHOUSE IN SMITHFIELD AND OTHERS DISPOSED OF THE WHOLE OF THE DIAMONDS
LJ013-0146 A JEW NAMED BENJAMIN EFFECTED THE SALE TO CERTAIN MERCHANTS NAMED BLOGG AND MARTIN
LJ013-0147 WHO DECLARED THAT THE ROUGH DIAMOND MARKET WAS IN SUCH A DEPRESSED CONDITION THAT THEY COULD ONLY AFFORD TO GIVE £1750 FOR STONES WORTH
LJ013-0148 FOUR THOUSAND POUNDS
LJ013-0149 THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS PURCHASE OF BRILLIANTS FROM A STRANGER AT SUCH AN INADEQUATE PRICE WAS STRONGLY COMMENTED UPON AT KER'S TRIAL
LJ013-0150 THE MOMENT IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE DIAMONDS HAD DISAPPEARED THE AFFAIR WAS TAKEN UP BY THE POLICE
LJ013-0151 FORRESTER THE DETECTIVE WHO HAD PURSUED AND CAPTURED BURGESS AT BOSTON TRACKED KER TO FRANCE AND FOLLOWING HIM THERE EVENTUALLY CAPTURED HIM
LJ013-0152 AT MONTREUIL. HE WAS ARRAIGNED AT THE OLD BAILEY AND THE CASE FULLY PROVED. HIS SENTENCE WAS SEVEN YEARS' TRANSPORTATION
LJ013-0153 THE GRAVEST CRIMES CONTINUED AT INTERVALS TO INSPIRE THE TOWN WITH HORROR AND CONCENTRATE PUBLIC ATTENTION UPON THE JAIL OF NEWGATE
LJ013-0154 AND THE MURDERERS IMMURED WITHIN ITS WALLS
LJ013-0155 COURVOISIER'S CASE MADE A GREAT STIR THERE WAS UNUSUAL ATROCITY IN THIS MURDER OF AN AGED INFIRM GENTLEMAN
LJ013-0156 A SCION OF THE DUCAL HOUSE OF BEDFORD BY HIS CONFIDENTIAL VALET AND PERSONAL ATTENDANT
LJ013-0157 LORD WILLIAM RUSSELL LIVED ALONE IN NORFOLK STREET PARK LANE. HE WAS A WIDOWER AND SEVENTYTHREE YEARS OF AGE
LJ013-0158 ONE MORNING IN MAY HIS LORDSHIP WAS FOUND DEAD IN HIS BED WITH HIS THROAT CUT
LJ013-0159 THE FACT OF THE MURDER WAS FIRST DISCOVERED BY THE HOUSEMAID
LJ013-0160 WHO ON GOING DOWN EARLY WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THE DININGROOM IN A STATE OF UTTER CONFUSION
LJ013-0161 THE FURNITURE TURNED UPSIDE DOWN THE DRAWERS OF THE ESCRITOIRE OPEN AND RIFLED
LJ013-0162 A BUNDLE LYING ON THE FLOOR AS THOUGH THIEVES HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED IN THE ACT
LJ013-0163 THE HOUSEMAID SUMMONED THE COOK AND BOTH WENT TO CALL THE VALET COURVOISIER
LJ013-0164 WHO CAME FROM HIS ROOM READY DRESSED A SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCE AS HE WAS ALWAYS LATE IN THE MORNING
LJ013-0165 THE HOUSEMAID SUGGESTED THAT THEY SHOULD SEE IF HIS LORDSHIP WAS ALL RIGHT AND THE THREE WENT TO HIS BEDROOM
LJ013-0166 WHILE COURVOISIER OPENED THE SHUTTERS THE HOUSEMAID APPROACHING THE BED SAW THAT THE PILLOW WAS SATURATED WITH BLOOD
LJ013-0167 THE DISCOVERY OF THE MURDERED MAN IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED. THE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS ALARMED THE POLICE SENT FOR AND A CLOSE INQUIRY FORTHWITH COMMENCED
LJ013-0168 THAT LORD WILLIAM RUSSELL HAD COMMITTED SUICIDE WAS AT ONCE DECLARED IMPOSSIBLE
LJ013-0169 IT WAS ALSO CLEARLY PROVED THAT NO FORCIBLE ENTRY HAD BEEN MADE INTO THE HOUSE
LJ013-0170 THE FRESH MARKS OF VIOLENCE UPON THE DOOR HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN MADE INSIDE AND NOT FROM OUTSIDE
LJ013-0171 MOREOVER THE INSTRUMENTS POKER AND CHISEL BY WHICH THEY HAD NO DOUBT BEEN EFFECTED
LJ013-0172 WERE FOUND IN THE BUTLER'S PANTRY USED BY COURVOISIER
LJ013-0173 THE RESEARCHES OF THE POLICE SOON LAID BARE OTHER SUSPICIOUS FACTS
LJ013-0174 THE BUNDLE FOUND IN THE DININGROOM CONTAINED WITH CLOTHES VARIOUS SMALL ARTICLES OF PLATE AND JEWELERY WHICH A THIEF WOULD PROBABLY HAVE PUT INTO HIS POCKET
LJ013-0175 UPSTAIRS IN THE BEDROOM A ROULEAUX BOX FOR SOVEREIGNS HAD BEEN BROKEN OPEN
LJ013-0176 ALSO THE JEWELBOX AND NOTECASE FROM THE LATTER OF WHICH WAS ABSTRACTED A TENPOUND NOTE KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN IN THE POSSESSION OF THE DECEASED
LJ013-0177 HIS LORDSHIP'S WATCH WAS GONE
LJ013-0178 FURTHER SUSPICION WAS CAUSED BY THE POSITION OF A BOOK AND A WAX CANDLE BY THE BEDSIDE
LJ013-0179 THE LATTER WAS SO PLACED THAT IT COULD THROW NO LIGHT ON THE FORMER WHICH WAS A LIFE OF SIR SAMUEL ROMILLY
LJ013-0180 THE INTENTION OF THE REAL MURDERER TO SHIFT THE CRIME TO BURGLARS WAS EVIDENT ALTHOUGH FUTILE
LJ013-0181 AND THE POLICE FEELING CONVINCED THAT THE CRIME HAD BEEN COMMITTED BY SOME INMATE OF THE HOUSE
LJ013-0182 TOOK COURVOISIER INTO CUSTODY AND PLACED THE TWO FEMALE SERVANTS UNDER SURVEILLANCE
LJ013-0183 THE VALET'S STRANGE DEMEANOR HAD ATTRACTED ATTENTION FROM THE FIRST
LJ013-0184 HE HAD HUNG OVER THE BODY IN A STATE OF DREADFUL AGITATION ANSWERING NO QUESTIONS AND TAKING NO PART IN THE PROCEEDINGS
LJ013-0185 THREE DAYS LATER A CLOSE SEARCH OF THE BUTLER'S PANTRY PRODUCED FRESH CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE
LJ013-0186 BEHIND THE SKIRTING BOARD SEVERAL OF HIS LORDSHIP'S RINGS WERE DISCOVERED
LJ013-0187 NEAR IT WAS HIS WATERLOO MEDAL AND THE ABOVEMENTIONED TENPOUND NOTE
LJ013-0188 FURTHER INVESTIGATION WAS REWARDED BY THE DISCOVERY IN THE PANTRY OF A SPLIT GOLD RING USED BY LORD WILLIAM TO CARRY HIS KEYS ON
LJ013-0189 NEXT AND IN THE SAME PLACE A CHASED GOLD KEY
LJ013-0190 AND AT LAST HIS LORDSHIP'S WATCH WAS FOUND SECRETED UNDER THE LEADS OF THE SINK
LJ013-0191 ALL THIS WAS EVIDENCE SUFFICIENT TO WARRANT COURVOISIER'S COMMITTAL FOR TRIAL
LJ013-0192 BUT STILL HE FOUND FRIENDS AND A LIBERAL SUBSCRIPTION WAS RAISED AMONG THE FOREIGN SERVANTS IN LONDON TO PROVIDE FUNDS FOR HIS DEFENSE
LJ013-0193 COURVOISIER WHEN PUT ON HIS TRIAL PLEADED NOT GUILTY
LJ013-0194 BUT ON THE SECOND DAY THE DISCOVERY OF FRESH EVIDENCE MORE PARTICULARLY THE RECOVERY OF SOME OF LORD WILLIAM'S STOLEN PLATE
LJ013-0195 INDUCED THE PRISONER TO MAKE A FULL CONFESSION OF HIS CRIME TO THE LAWYERS WHO DEFENDED HIM
LJ013-0196 THIS PLACED THEM IN A POSITION OF MUCH EMBARRASSMENT. TO HAVE THROWN UP THEIR BRIEF WOULD HAVE BEEN TO HAVE SECURED COURVOISIER'S CONVICTION
LJ013-0197 MR. PHILLIPS WHO LED IN THE CASE WENT TO THE OTHER EXTREME
LJ013-0198 AND IN AN IMPASSIONED ADDRESS IMPLORED THE JURY NOT TO SEND AN INNOCENT MAN TO THE GALLOWS
LJ013-0199 IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT THE QUESTION WHETHER MR. PHILLIPS HAD NOT EXCEEDED THE LIMITS USUALLY ALLOWED TO COUNSEL WAS MUCH DEBATED AT THE TIME
LJ013-0200 THE JURY WITHOUT HESITATION FOUND COURVOISIER GUILTY AND HE WAS SENTENCED TO DEATH
LJ013-0201 THE PRISONER'S DEMEANOR HAD GREATLY CHANGED DURING THE TRIAL
LJ013-0202 COOLNESS AMOUNTING ALMOST TO EFFRONTERY GAVE WAY TO HOPELESS DEJECTION
LJ013-0203 ON HIS REMOVAL TO NEWGATE AFTER SENTENCE
LJ013-0204 HE ADMITTED THAT HE HAD BEEN JUSTLY CONVICTED AND EXPRESSED GREAT ANXIETY THAT HIS FELLOWSERVANTS SHOULD BE RELIEVED FROM ALL SUSPICION
LJ013-0205 LATER IN THE DAY HE TRIED TO COMMIT SUICIDE BY CRAMMING A TOWEL DOWN HIS THROAT BUT WAS PREVENTED
LJ013-0206 NEXT MORNING HE MADE A FULL CONFESSION IN PRESENCE OF HIS ATTORNEY AND THE GOVERNOR MR. COPE
LJ013-0207 IN THIS HE GAVE AS THE MOTIVES OF HIS CRIME A QUARREL HE HAD WITH HIS MASTER WHO THREATENED TO DISCHARGE HIM WITHOUT A CHARACTER
LJ013-0208 LORD WILLIAM ACCORDING TO THE VALET WAS OF A PEEVISH DIFFICULT TEMPER
LJ013-0209 HE WAS ANNOYED WITH HIS MAN FOR VARIOUS SMALL OMISSIONS AND ACTS OF FORGETFULNESS AND ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER HAD TAKEN COURVOISIER TO TASK RATHER SHARPLY
LJ013-0210 FINALLY ON COMING DOWNSTAIRS AFTER BEDTIME LORD WILLIAM HAD FOUND COURVOISIER IN THE DININGROOM
LJ013-0211 WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE ASKED HIS LORDSHIP
LJ013-0212 YOU CAN HAVE NO GOOD INTENTIONS YOU MUST QUIT MY SERVICE TOMORROW MORNING
LJ013-0213 THIS SEEMS TO HAVE DECIDED COURVOISIER
LJ013-0214 WHO TOOK A CARVINGKNIFE FROM THE SIDEBOARD IN THE DININGROOM WENT UPSTAIRS TO LORD WILLIAM'S BEDROOM AND DREW THE KNIFE ACROSS HIS THROAT
LJ013-0215 HE APPEARED TO DIE INSTANTLY SAID THE MURDERER IN CONCLUSION
LJ013-0216 HIS ACCOUNT OF HIS ACTS AND MOVEMENTS AFTER THE DEED
LJ013-0217 VARIED SO CONSIDERABLY IN THE SEVERAL DOCUMENTS HE LEFT BEHIND THAT TOO MUCH RELIANCE CANNOT BE PLACED UPON HIS CONFESSION
LJ013-0218 HIS LAST STATEMENT CONTAINS THE WORDS THE PUBLIC NOW THINK I AM A LIAR AND THEY WILL NOT BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY THE TRUTH
LJ013-0219 THIS WAS NO DOUBT THE CASE BUT THIS MUCH TRUTH HIS CONFESSION MAY BE TAKEN TO CONTAIN
LJ013-0220 THAT COURVOISIER WAS IDLE DISCONTENTED READY TO TAKE OFFENSE GREEDY OF GAIN
LJ013-0221 THAT HE COULD NOT RESIST THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ROBBERY OFFERED HIM BY HIS SITUATION AT LORD WILLIAM RUSSELL'S THAT WHEN VEXED WITH HIS MASTER
LJ013-0222 HE DID NOT SHRINK FROM MURDER BOTH FOR REVENGE AND TO CONCEAL HIS OTHER CRIMES
LJ013-0223 COURVOISIER WISHED TO COMMIT SUICIDE IN NEWGATE BUT WAS PREVENTED BY THE VIGILANT SUPERVISION TO WHICH HE WAS SUBJECTED WHILE IN JAIL
LJ013-0224 THE ATTEMPT WAS TO HAVE BEEN MADE BY OPENING A VEIN AND ALLOWING HIMSELF TO BLEED TO DEATH
LJ013-0225 THE SUNDAY NIGHT BEFORE HIS EXECUTION HE WOULD NOT GO TO BED WHEN ORDERED
LJ013-0226 THE GOVERNOR INSISTED BUT COURVOISIER SHOWED GREAT RELUCTANCE TO STRIP
LJ013-0227 THE ORDER WAS HOWEVER AT LENGTH OBEYED AND THE WHOLE OF THE PRISONER'S CLOTHES WERE MINUTELY SEARCHED
LJ013-0228 IN THE POCKET OF THE COAT MR. COPE THE GOVERNOR FOUND A NEATLYFOLDED CLOTH AND ASKED WHAT IT WAS FOR
LJ013-0229 COURVOISIER ADMITTED THAT HE HAD INTENDED TO BIND IT TIGHTLY ROUND HIS ARM AND BLEED HIMSELF TO DEATH IN THE NIGHT
LJ013-0230 THE NEXT INQUIRY WAS HOW HE HOPED TO OPEN A VEIN WITH A BIT OF SHARPENED STICK PICKED OUT OF THE ORDINARY FIREWOOD
LJ013-0231 WHERE IS IT ASKED THE GOVERNOR
LJ013-0232 THE PRISONER REPLIED THAT HE HAD LEFT IT IN THE MATTRESS OF WHICH HE HAD JUST BEEN DEPRIVED
LJ013-0233 THE BED WAS SEARCHED BUT NO PIECE OF SHARPENED WOOD WAS FOUND. IT WAS THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN LOST IN CHANGING THE MATTRESSES
LJ013-0234 THE CLOTH ABOVE REFERRED TO BELONGED TO THE INNER SEAM OF HIS TROUSERS WHICH HE HAD MANAGED TO TEAR OUT
LJ013-0235 THERE IS NOTHING TO SHOW THAT COURVOISIER REALLY CONTEMPLATED SELFDESTRUCTION
LJ013-0236 A MURDER WHICH REPRODUCED MANY OF THE FEATURES OF THAT COMMITTED BY GREENACRE SOON FOLLOWED AND EXCITED THE PUBLIC MIND EVEN MORE THAN THAT OF COURVOISIER'S
LJ013-0237 DANIEL GOOD'S CRIME MIGHT HAVE REMAINED LONG UNDISCOVERED BUT FOR HIS OWN CARELESS STUPIDITY
LJ013-0238 HE WAS COACHMAN TO A GENTLEMAN AT ROEHAMPTON ONE DAY HE WENT INTO A PAWNBROKER'S AT WANDSWORTH AND BOUGHT A PAIR OF BREECHES ON CREDIT
LJ013-0239 AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS SEEN TO STEAL AND SECRETE A PAIR OF TROUSERS. THE SHOPBOY GAVE INFORMATION
LJ013-0240 GOOD WAS FOLLOWED TO HIS STABLES BY A POLICEMAN BUT OBSTINATELY DENIED THE THEFT
LJ013-0241 THE POLICEMAN INSISTED ON SEARCHING THE PREMISES AT WHICH GOOD DISPLAYED SOME UNEASINESS
LJ013-0242 THIS INCREASED WHEN THE OFFICER ACCOMPANIED BY TWO OTHERS A NEIGHBOR AND A BAILIFF ENTERED ONE OF THE STABLES
LJ013-0243 GOOD NOW OFFERED TO GO TO WANDSWORTH AND SATISFY THE PAWNBROKER
LJ013-0244 JUST AT THIS MOMENT HOWEVER THE SEARCHERS FOUND CONCEALED UNDER TWO TRUSSES OF HAY A WOMAN'S HEADLESS AND DISMEMBERED TRUNK
LJ013-0245 AT THE CONSTABLE'S CRY OF ALARM GOOD RUSHED FROM THE STABLE AND LOCKED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM
LJ013-0246 SOME TIME ELAPSED BEFORE THE IMPRISONED PARTY COULD FORCE OPEN THE DOORS AND BY THEN THE FUGITIVE HAD ESCAPED
LJ013-0247 MEDICAL ASSISTANCE HAVING BEEN SUMMONED IT WAS ASCERTAINED HOW THE DISMEMBERMENT HAD BEEN EFFECTED
LJ013-0248 AT THE SAME TIME AN OVERPOWERING ODOR ATTRACTED THEM TO THE ADJOINING HARNESSROOM WHERE THE MISSING REMAINS WERE RAKED OUT
LJ013-0249 HALF CONSUMED IN THE ASHES OF A WOOD FIRE
LJ013-0250 IN THE SAME ROOM A LARGE AXE AND SAW WERE FOUND COVERED WITH BLOOD
LJ013-0251 INQUIRY INTO THE CHARACTER OF GOOD EXPOSED HIM AS A LOOSE LIVER WHO KEPT COMPANY WITH SEVERAL WOMEN
LJ013-0252 ONE CALLED HIS SISTER BUT SUPPOSED TO BE HIS WIFE HAD OCCUPIED A ROOM IN SOUTH STREET MANCHESTER SQUARE
LJ013-0253 WITH A SON OF GOOD'S BY A FORMER WIFE ANOTHER WIFE REAL OR FICTITIOUS EXISTED IN SPITALFIELDS
LJ013-0254 AND EVIDENCE WAS GIVEN OF CLOSE RELATION BETWEEN GOOD AND A THIRD WOMAN A GIRL NAMED BUTCHER RESIDING AT WOOLWICH
LJ013-0255 THE VICTIM WAS THE FIRST OF THESE THREE
LJ013-0256 GOOD HAD TOLD HER MUCH TO HER PERTURBATION THAT SHE WAS TO MOVE FROM SOUTH STREET TO ROEHAMPTON AND ONE DAY HE FETCHED HER
LJ013-0257 THEY WERE SEEN TOGETHER ON BARNES COMMON AND AGAIN IN PUTNEY PARK LANE WHERE THEY WERE TALKING LOUD AND ANGRILY
LJ013-0258 THE POOR CREATURE WAS NEVER SEEN AGAIN ALIVE
LJ013-0259 THE ACTUAL METHOD OF THE MURDER WAS NEVER EXACTLY ASCERTAINED
LJ013-0260 GOOD HIMSELF REMAINED AT LARGE FOR SOME WEEKS. HE HAD TRAMPED AS FAR AS TUNBRIDGE WHERE HE OBTAINED WORK AS A BRICKLAYER'S LABORER
LJ013-0261 HE THERE GAVE SATISFACTION FOR INDUSTRY BUT HE WAS TACITURN AND WOULD HOLD NO CONVERSE WITH HIS FELLOWS
LJ013-0262 THE WOMAN WHERE HE LODGED NOTICED THAT HE WAS VERY RESTLESS AT NIGHT MOANING AND SIGHING MUCH. DETECTION CAME UNEXPECTEDLY
LJ013-0263 HE WAS RECOGNIZED BY AN EXPOLICEMAN WHO HAD KNOWN HIM AT ROEHAMPTON AND IMMEDIATELY ARRESTED
LJ013-0264 IN HIS EFFECTS WERE FOUND THE CLOTHES HE HAD ON AT THE TIME OF HIS ESCAPE FROM THE STABLES AND UNDER THE JACKET HE WAS WEARING
LJ013-0265 WAS A PIECE OF A WOMAN'S CALICO APRON STAINED WITH BLOOD WHICH HE HAD USED TO SAVE THE PRESSURE ON HIS SHOULDER BY THE HOD
LJ013-0266 GOOD WAS COMMITTED TO NEWGATE AND TRIED AT THE CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT BEFORE A CROWDED COURT
LJ013-0267 HE MADE A RAMBLING DEFENSE ENDING BY SAYING
LJ013-0268 GOOD LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ALL I HAVE A GREAT DEAL MORE TO SAY BUT I AM SO BAD I CANNOT SAY IT
LJ014-0001 THE CHRONICLES OF NEWGATE VOLUME TWO BY ARTHUR GRIFFITHS SECTION 17 NEWGATE NOTORIETIES CONTINUED PART TWO
LJ014-0002 HOCKER'S MURDER IS IN ITS WAY INTERESTING AS AFFORDING ANOTHER PROOF OF THE EXTRAORDINARY WAY IN WHICH THE CULPRIT RETURNED TO THE SCENE OF HIS GUILT
LJ014-0003 THE CRIES OF HIS VICTIM A MR. DELARUE
LJ014-0004 BROUGHT PASSERSBY AND POLICEMEN TO THE SPOT A LONELY PLACE NEAR A DEAD WALL BEYOND BELSIZE HALL HAMPSTEAD
LJ014-0005 BUT TOO LATE TO GIVE SUBSTANTIAL AID
LJ014-0006 WHILE THE BODY LAY THERE STILL WARM BATTERED AND BLEEDING FROM THE CRUEL BLOWS INFLICTED UPON HIM BY HIS COWARDLY ASSAILANT A MAN CAME BY SINGING
LJ014-0007 HE ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION WITH THE POLICEMEN AND LEARNT AS IT SEEMED FOR THE FIRST TIME WHAT HAD HAPPENED
LJ014-0008 HIS REMARK WAS IT IS A NASTY JOB HE TOOK HOLD OF THE DEAD HAND AND CONFESSED THAT HE FELT QUEER AT THE SHOCKING SIGHT
LJ014-0009 THIS SIGHT WAS HIS OWN HANDIWORK
LJ014-0010 YET HE COULD NOT OVERCOME THE STRANGE FASCINATION IT HAD FOR HIM AND REMAINED BY THE SIDE OF THE CORPSE TILL THE STRETCHER CAME
LJ014-0011 EVEN THEN HE FOLLOWED IT AS FAR AS BELSIZE LANE
LJ014-0012 IT WAS HERE THAT THE OTHERS ENGAGED IN THEIR DISMAL OFFICE IN REMOVING THE DEAD FIRST GOT A GOOD LOOK AT THE STRANGER'S FACE
LJ014-0013 HE WANTED A LIGHT FOR A CIGAR AND GOT IT FROM A LANTERN WHICH WAS LIFTED UP AND FULLY BETRAYED HIS FEATURES
LJ014-0014 IT WAS NOTICED THAT HE WORE A MACKINTOSH. NEXT DAY THE POLICE IN MAKING A CAREFUL SEARCH OF THE SCENE OF THE MURDER
LJ014-0015 PICKED UP A COATBUTTON WHICH AFTERWARDS PLAYED AN IMPORTANT PART IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE MURDERER
LJ014-0016 A LETTER WHICH AFFORDED AN ADDITIONAL CLUE WAS ALSO FOUND IN THE POCKET OF THE DECEASED. STILL IT WAS MANY WEEKS BEFORE ANY ARREST WAS MADE
LJ014-0017 IN THE MEAN TIME THE POLICE WERE NOT IDLE
LJ014-0018 IT CAME OUT BY DEGREES THAT THE PERSON WHO HAD BEEN SEEN IN BELSIZE LANE ON THE NIGHT THE BODY WAS FOUND WAS A FRIEND OF THE DECEASED
LJ014-0019 HIS NAME WAS HOCKER HE WAS BY TRADE A LADIES' SHOEMAKER AND IT WAS ALSO ASCERTAINED THAT AFTER THE DAY OF THE MURDER HE WAS FLUSH OF MONEY
LJ014-0020 HE WAS SOON AFTERWARDS ARRESTED ON SUSPICION AND A SEARCH OF HIS LODGINGS BROUGHT TO LIGHT SEVERAL GARMENTS SATURATED WITH BLOOD
LJ014-0021 A COAT AMONG THEM MUCH TORN AND STAINED WITH THREE BUTTONS MISSING ONE OF WHICH CORRESPONDED WITH THAT PICKED UP AT HAMPSTEAD
LJ014-0022 THE LETTER FOUND IN THE POCKET OF THE DECEASED WAS SEALED WITH A WAFER MARKED F
LJ014-0023 AND MANY OF THE SAME SORT WERE FOUND IN THE POSSESSION OF THE ACCUSED. THIS WAS ENOUGH TO OBTAIN A COMMITTAL
LJ014-0024 AFTER SEVERAL REMANDS BUT THE CASE CONTAINED ELEMENTS OF DOUBT AND THE EVIDENCE AT THE TRIAL WAS ENTIRELY CIRCUMSTANTIAL
LJ014-0025 A WITNESS DEPOSED TO MEETING HOCKER SOON AFTER THE CRIES OF MURDER WERE HEARD
LJ014-0026 RUNNING AT A DOGTROT INTO LONDON AND OTHERS SWORE THAT THEY PLAINLY RECOGNIZED HIM AS THE MAN SEEN SOON AFTERWARDS IN THE LANE
LJ014-0027 A WOMAN WHOM HE CALLED ON THE SAME EVENING DECLARED HE HAD WORN A MACKINTOSH HIS COAT WAS MUCH TORN THERE WAS A STAIN OF BLOOD ON HIS SHIRTCUFF
LJ014-0028 AND HE WAS IN POSSESSION THE FIRST TIME TO HER KNOWLEDGE OF A WATCH
LJ014-0029 THIS WAS DELARUE'S WATCH FULLY IDENTIFIED AS SUCH WHICH HOCKER TOLD HIS BROTHER DELARUE HAD GIVEN HIM THE MORNING OF THE MURDER
LJ014-0030 THESE WERE DAMNATORY FACTS WHICH WELL SUPPORTED THE PROSECUTION
LJ014-0031 THE PRISONER MADE AN ELABORATE DEFENSE IN WHICH HE SOUGHT TO VILIFY THE CHARACTER OF DECEASED
LJ014-0032 AS THE SEDUCER OF AN INNOCENT GIRL TO WHOM HE HOCKER HAD BEEN FONDLY ATTACHED
LJ014-0033 WHEN HER RUIN WAS DISCOVERED HER BROTHER PANTED FOR REVENGE
LJ014-0034 HOCKER WHOSE SKILL IN COUNTERFEITING HANDWRITING WAS KNOWN WAS ASKED TO FABRICATE A LETTER MAKING AN ASSIGNATION WITH DELARUE
LJ014-0035 IN A LONELY PART OF HAMPSTEAD
LJ014-0036 HOCKER AND THE BROTHER WENT TO THE SPOT WHERE THE LATTER LEFT HIM TO MEET HIS SISTER'S SEDUCER ALONE
LJ014-0037 SOON AFTERWARDS HOCKER HEARD CRIES OF MURDER
LJ014-0038 AND PROCEEDING TO WHERE THEY CAME FROM FOUND DELARUE DEAD SLAIN BY THE FURIOUS BROTHER
LJ014-0039 HOCKER WAS SO OVERCOME FEELING HIMSELF THE PRINCIPAL CAUSE OF THE TRAGEDY
LJ014-0040 THAT HE RUSHED TO A SLAUGHTERHOUSE IN HAMPSTEAD AND PURPOSELY STAINED HIS CLOTHES WITH BLOOD
LJ014-0041 SUCH AN EXTRAVAGANT DEFENSE DID NOT WEIGH WITH JUDGE OR JURY
LJ014-0042 THE FIRST SUMMED UP DEAD AGAINST THE PRISONER AND THE LATTER AFTER RETIRING FOR TEN MINUTES FOUND HIM GUILTY
LJ014-0043 HOCKER'S CONDUCT IN NEWGATE WHILE UNDER SENTENCE OF DEATH WAS MOST EXTRAORDINARY
LJ014-0044 HE DREW UP SEVERAL LONG STATEMENTS CONTAINING NARRATIVES PURELY FICTITIOUS IMPUTING CRIMES TO HIS VICTIM AND REPEATING HIS LINE OF DEFENSE
LJ014-0045 THAT DELARUE HAD SUFFERED BY THE HANDS OF IMAGINARY OUTRAGED BROTHERS ACTING AS THE AVENGERS OF FEMALES DEEPLY INJURED BY HIM
LJ014-0046 HOCKER MADE SEVERAL PRETENDED CONFESSIONS AND REVELATIONS ALL OF WHICH WERE PROVED TO BE ABSOLUTELY FALSE BY THE POLICE ON INQUIRY
LJ014-0047 HIS DEMEANOR WAS A STRANGE COMPOUND OF WICKEDNESS FALSEHOOD AND DECEIT
LJ014-0048 BUT AT THE FATAL HOUR HIS HARDIHOOD FORSOOK HIM AND HE WAS ALMOST INSENSIBLE WHEN TAKEN OUT OF HIS CELL FOR EXECUTION
LJ014-0049 RESTORATIVES WERE APPLIED BUT HE WAS IN A FAINTING CONDITION WHEN TIED AND HAD TO BE SUPPORTED BY THE ASSISTANT EXECUTIONER
LJ014-0050 WHILE CALCRAFT ADJUSTED THE NOOSE
LJ014-0051 THERE WAS AN EPIDEMIC OF MURDER IN THE UNITED KINGDOM ABOUT EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT TO NINE
LJ014-0052 IN NOVEMBER OF THE FIRSTNAMED YEAR OCCURRED THE WHOLESALE SLAUGHTER OF THE JERMYS IN THEIR HOUSE STANFIELD HALL BY THE MISCREANT RUSH
LJ014-0053 SOON AFTERWARDS IN GLOUCESTERSHIRE
LJ014-0054 A MAIDSERVANT SARAH THOMAS MURDERED HER MISTRESS AN AGED WOMAN BY BEATING OUT HER BRAINS WITH A STONE
LJ014-0055 NEXT YEAR JOHN GLEESON WILSON AT LIVERPOOL MURDERED A WOMAN ANN HENRICHSON ALSO A MAIDSERVANT AND TWO CHILDREN
LJ014-0056 WHILE IN IRELAND A WIFE DASHED OUT HER HUSBAND'S BRAINS WITH A HAMMER
LJ014-0057 LONDON DID NOT ESCAPE THE CONTAGION AND PROMINENT AMONG THE DETESTABLE CRIMES OF THE PERIOD STANDS THAT OF THE MANNINGS AT BERMONDSEY
LJ014-0058 THESE GREAT CRIMINALS SUFFERED AT HORSEMONGER LANE JAIL BUT THEY WERE TRIED AT THE CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT AND WERE FOR SOME TIME INMATES OF NEWGATE
LJ014-0059 THEIR VICTIM WAS A MAN NAMED PATRICK O'CONNOR A CUSTOMHOUSE GAUGER WHO HAD BEEN A SUITOR OF MARIE DE ROUX BEFORE SHE BECAME MRS. MANNING
LJ014-0060 MARIE DE ROUX UP TO THE TIME OF HER MARRIAGE HAD BEEN IN SERVICE AS LADY'S MAID TO LADY BLANTYRE DAUGHTER OF THE DUCHESS OF SUTHERLAND
LJ014-0061 AND MANNING HOPED TO GET SOME SMALL GOVERNMENT APPOINTMENT THROUGH HIS WIFE'S INTEREST
LJ014-0062 HE HAD FAILED IN THIS AS WELL AS IN THE BUSINESS OF A PUBLICAN WHICH HE HAD AT ONE TIME ADOPTED
LJ014-0063 AFTER THE MARRIAGE A CLOSE INTIMACY WAS STILL MAINTAINED BETWEEN O'CONNOR AND THE MANNINGS
LJ014-0064 HE LIVED AT MILE END WHENCE HE WALKED OFTEN TO CALL AT 3 MINVER PLACE BERMONDSEY THE RESIDENCE OF HIS OLD LOVE
LJ014-0065 O'CONNOR WAS A MAN OF SUBSTANCE HE HAD LONG FOLLOWED THE PROFITABLE TRADE OF A MONEYLENDER
LJ014-0066 AND BY DINT OF USURIOUS INTEREST ON SMALL SUMS ADVANCED TO NEEDY NEIGHBORS HAD AMASSED AS MUCH AS EIGHT THOUSAND POUNDS OR TEN THOUSAND POUNDS
LJ014-0067 HIS WEALTH WAS WELL KNOWN TO MARIA AS HE CALLED MRS. MANNING WHO MADE SEVERAL INEFFECTUAL ATTEMPTS TO GET MONEY OUT OF HIM
LJ014-0068 AT LAST THIS FIENDISH WOMAN MADE UP HER MIND TO MURDER O'CONNOR AND APPROPRIATE ALL HIS POSSESSIONS
LJ014-0069 HER HUSBAND TO WHOM SHE COOLLY CONFIDED HER INTENTION
LJ014-0070 A HEAVY BRUTISH FELLOW WAS YET AGHAST AT HIS WIFE'S RESOLVE AND TRIED HARD TO DISSUADE HER FROM BAD PURPOSE
LJ014-0071 IN HIS CONFESSION AFTER SENTENCE HE DECLARED THAT SHE PLIED HIM WELL WITH BRANDY AT THIS PERIOD
LJ014-0072 AND THAT DURING THE WHOLE TIME HE WAS NEVER IN HIS RIGHT SENSES
LJ014-0073 MEANWHILE THIS WOMAN UNFLINCHING IN HER COLD BLOODY DETERMINATION CAREFULLY LAID ALL HER PLANS FOR THE CONSUMMATION OF THE DEED
LJ014-0074 ONE FINE AFTERNOON IN AUGUST O'CONNOR WAS MET WALKING IN THE DIRECTION OF BERMONDSEY
LJ014-0075 HE WAS DRESSED WITH PARTICULAR CARE AS HE WAS TO DINE AT THE MANNINGS AND MEET FRIENDS ONE A YOUNG LADY
LJ014-0076 HE WAS SEEN AFTERWARDS SMOKING AND TALKING WITH HIS HOSTS IN THEIR BACK PARLOR AND NEVER SEEN AGAIN ALIVE
LJ014-0077 IT CAME OUT IN THE HUSBAND'S CONFESSION THAT MRS. MANNING INDUCED O'CONNOR TO GO DOWN TO THE KITCHEN TO WASH HIS HANDS THAT SHE FOLLOWED HIM TO THE BASEMENT
LJ014-0078 THAT SHE STOOD BEHIND HIM AS HE STOOD NEAR THE OPEN GRAVE SHE HERSELF HAD DUG FOR HIM
LJ014-0079 AND WHICH HE MISTOOK FOR A DRAIN AND THAT WHILE HE WAS SPEAKING TO HER SHE PUT THE MUZZLE OF A PISTOL CLOSE TO THE BACK OF HIS HEAD AND SHOT HIM DOWN
LJ014-0080 SHE RAN UPSTAIRS TOLD HER HUSBAND MADE HIM GO DOWN TO LOOK AT HER HANDIWORK AND AS O'CONNOR WAS NOT QUITE DEAD
LJ014-0081 MANNING GAVE THE COUP DE GRACE WITH A CROWBAR
LJ014-0082 AFTER THIS MRS. MANNING CHANGED HER DRESS AND WENT OFF IN A CAB TO O'CONNOR'S LODGINGS
LJ014-0083 WHICH HAVING POSSESSED HERSELF OF THE MURDERED MAN'S KEYS SHE RIFLED FROM END TO END
LJ014-0084 RETURNING TO HER OWN HOME WHERE MANNING MEANTIME HAD BEEN CALMLY SMOKING AND TALKING TO THE NEIGHBORS OVER THE BASEMENT WALL
LJ014-0085 THE CORPSE LYING JUST INSIDE THE KITCHEN ALL THE WHILE THE TWO SET TO WORK TO STRIP THE BODY AND HIDE IT UNDER THE STONES OF THE FLOOR
LJ014-0086 THIS JOB WAS NOT COMPLETED TILL THE FOLLOWING DAY AS THE HOLE HAD TO BE ENLARGED AND THE ONLY TOOL THEY HAD WAS A DUSTSHOVEL
LJ014-0087 A QUANTITY OF QUICKLIME WAS THROWN IN WITH THE BODY TO DESTROY ALL IDENTIFICATION
LJ014-0088 THIS WAS ON A THURSDAY EVENING
LJ014-0089 FOR THE REMAINDER OF THAT WEEK AND PART OF THE NEXT THE MURDERERS STAYED IN THE HOUSE AND OCCUPIED THE KITCHEN CLOSE TO THE REMAINS OF THEIR VICTIM
LJ014-0090 ON THE SUNDAY MRS. MANNING ROASTED A GOOSE AT THIS SAME KITCHEN FIRE AND ATE IT WITH RELISH IN THE AFTERNOON
LJ014-0091 THIS COLDBLOODED INDIFFERENCE AFTER THE EVENT WAS ONLY OUTDONE BY THE PREMEDITATION OF THIS HORRIBLE MURDER
LJ014-0092 THE HOLE MUST HAVE BEEN EXCAVATED AND THE QUICKLIME PURCHASED QUITE THREE WEEKS BEFORE O'CONNOR MET HIS DEATH
LJ014-0093 AND DURING THAT TIME HE MUST FREQUENTLY HAVE STOOD OR SAT OVER HIS OWN GRAVE
LJ014-0094 DISCOVERY OF THE MURDER CAME IN THIS WISE. O'CONNOR A PUNCTUAL AND WELLCONDUCTED OFFICIAL WAS AT ONCE MISSED AT THE LONDON DOCKS
LJ014-0095 ON THE THIRD DAY HIS FRIENDS BEGAN TO INQUIRE FOR HIM
LJ014-0096 AND AT THEIR REQUEST TWO POLICE OFFICERS WERE SENT TO BERMONDSEY TO INQUIRE FOR HIM AT THE MANNINGS WITH WHOM IT WAS WELL KNOWN THAT HE WAS VERY INTIMATE
LJ014-0097 THE MANNINGS HAD SEEN OR HEARD NOTHING OF HIM OF COURSE. AS O'CONNOR STILL DID NOT TURN UP THE POLICE AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS RETURNED TO MINVER PLACE
LJ014-0098 THE HOUSE WAS EMPTY BARE AND STRIPPED OF ALL ITS FURNITURE AND ITS FORMER OCCUPANTS HAD DECAMPED
LJ014-0099 THE CIRCUMSTANCE WAS SUSPICIOUS AND A SEARCH WAS AT ONCE MADE OF THE WHOLE PREMISES
LJ014-0100 IN THE BACK KITCHEN ONE OF THE DETECTIVES REMARKED THAT THE CEMENT BETWEEN CERTAIN STONES LOOKED LIGHTER THAN THE REST AND ON TRYING IT WITH A KNIFE
LJ014-0101 HE FOUND THAT IT WAS SOFT AND NEW WHILE ELSEWHERE IT WAS SET AND HARD
LJ014-0102 THE STONES WERE AT ONCE TAKEN UP
LJ014-0103 BENEATH THEM WAS A LAYER OF FRESH MORTAR BENEATH THAT A LOT OF LOOSE EARTH AMONGST WHICH A STOCKING WAS TURNED UP AND PRESENTLY A HUMAN TOE
LJ014-0104 SIX INCHES LOWER THE BODY OF O'CONNOR WAS UNCOVERED
LJ014-0105 HE WAS LYING ON HIS FACE HIS LEGS TIED UP TO HIS HIPS SO AS TO ALLOW OF THE BODY FITTING INTO THE HOLE
LJ014-0106 THE LIME HAD DONE ITS WORK SO RAPIDLY THAT THE FEATURES WOULD HAVE BEEN INDISTINGUISHABLE BUT FOR THE PROMINENT CHIN AND A SET OF FALSE TEETH
LJ014-0107 THE CORPSE SETTLED ALL DOUBTS AND THE NEXT POINT WAS TO LAY HANDS UPON THE MANNINGS
LJ014-0108 IT WAS SOON ASCERTAINED THAT THE WIFE HAD GONE OFF IN A CAB WITH A QUANTITY OF LUGGAGE
LJ014-0109 PART OF THIS SHE HAD DEPOSITED TO BE LEFT TILL CALLED FOR AT ONE STATION WHILE SHE HAD GONE HERSELF TO ANOTHER THAT AT EUSTON SQUARE
LJ014-0110 AT THE FIRST THE BOXES WERE IMPOUNDED OPENED AND FOUND TO CONTAIN MANY OF O'CONNOR'S EFFECTS
LJ014-0111 AT THE SECOND EXACT INFORMATION WAS OBTAINED OF MRS. MANNING'S MOVEMENTS. SHE HAD GONE TO EDINBURGH
LJ014-0112 A TELEGRAPHIC MESSAGE THEN NEWLY ADAPTED TO THE PURPOSES OF CRIMINAL DETECTION
LJ014-0113 ADVISED THE EDINBURGH POLICE OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR AND WITHIN AN HOUR AN ANSWER WAS TELEGRAPHED STATING THAT MRS. MANNING WAS IN CUSTODY
LJ014-0114 SHE HAD BEEN TO BROKERS TO NEGOTIATE THE SALE OF CERTAIN FOREIGN RAILWAY STOCK WITH WHICH THEY HAD BEEN WARNED FROM LONDON NOT TO DEAL
LJ014-0115 AND THEY HAD GIVEN INFORMATION TO THE POLICE
LJ014-0116 HER ARREST WAS PLANNED AND WHEN THE TELEGRAM ARRIVED FROM LONDON COMPLETED
LJ014-0117 AN EXAMINATION OF HER BOXES DISCLOSED A QUANTITY OF O'CONNOR'S PROPERTY
LJ014-0118 MRS. MANNING WAS TRANSFERRED TO LONDON AND LODGED IN THE HORSEMONGER LANE JAIL WHERE HER HUSBAND SOON AFTERWARDS JOINED HER
LJ014-0119 HE HAD FLED TO JERSEY WHERE HE WAS RECOGNIZED AND ARRESTED
LJ014-0120 EACH TRIED TO THROW THE BLAME ON THE OTHER MANNING DECLARED HIS WIFE HAD COMMITTED THE MURDER MRS. MANNING INDIGNANTLY DENIED THE CHARGE
LJ014-0121 THE PRISONERS WERE IN DUE COURSE TRANSFERRED TO NEWGATE TO BE PUT UPON THEIR TRIAL AT THE CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT
LJ014-0122 A GREAT NUMBER OF DISTINGUISHED PEOPLE ASSEMBLED AS USUAL AT THE OLD BAILEY ON THE DAY OF TRIAL
LJ014-0123 THE MANNINGS WERE ARRAIGNED TOGETHER THE HUSBAND STANDING AT ONE OF THE FRONT CORNERS OF THE DOCK HIS WIFE AT THE OTHER END
LJ014-0124 MANNING WHO WAS DRESSED IN BLACK APPEARED TO BE A HEAVY BULLNECKED REPULSIVELOOKING MAN WITH A VERY FAIR COMPLEXION AND LIGHT HAIR
LJ014-0125 MRS. MANNING WAS NOT WITHOUT PERSONAL CHARMS
LJ014-0126 HER FACE WAS COMELY SHE HAD DARK HAIR AND GOOD EYES AND WAS ABOVE THE MIDDLE HEIGHT YET INCLINED TO BE STOUT
LJ014-0127 SHE WAS SMARTLY DRESSED IN A PLAID SHAWL A WHITE LACE CAP
LJ014-0128 HER HAIR WAS DRESSED IN LONG CREPE BANDS SHE HAD LACE RUFFLES AT HER WRIST AND WORE PRIMROSECOLORED KID GLOVES
LJ014-0129 THE CASE RESTED UPON THE FACTS WHICH HAVE BEEN ALREADY SET FORTH AND WAS PROVED TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE JURY WHO BROUGHT IN A VERDICT OF GUILTY
LJ014-0130 MANNING WHEN SENTENCE OF DEATH WAS PASSED ON HIM SAID NOTHING
LJ014-0131 BUT MRS. MANNING SPEAKING IN A FOREIGN ACCENT ADDRESSED THE COURT WITH GREAT FLUENCY AND VEHEMENCE
LJ014-0132 SHE COMPLAINED THAT SHE HAD NO JUSTICE THERE WAS NO LAW FOR HER SHE HAD FOUND NO PROTECTION EITHER FROM JUDGES THE PROSECUTOR OR HER HUSBAND
LJ014-0133 SHE HAD NOT BEEN TREATED LIKE A CHRISTIAN BUT LIKE A WILD BEAST OF THE FOREST. SHE DECLARED THAT THE MONEY FOUND IN HER POSSESSION HAD BEEN SENT HER FROM ABROAD
LJ014-0134 THAT O'CONNOR HAD BEEN MORE TO HER THAN HER HUSBAND THAT SHE OUGHT TO HAVE MARRIED HIM
LJ014-0135 IT WAS AGAINST COMMON SENSE TO CHARGE HER WITH MURDERING THE ONLY FRIEND SHE HAD IN THE WORLD
LJ014-0136 THE CULPRIT WAS REALLY HER HUSBAND WHO KILLED O'CONNOR OUT OF JEALOUSY AND REVENGEFUL FEELINGS
LJ014-0137 WHEN THE JUDGE ASSUMED THE BLACK CAP
LJ014-0138 MRS. MANNING BECAME STILL MORE VIOLENT SHOUTING NO NO I WILL NOT STAND IT YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES
LJ014-0139 AND WOULD HAVE LEFT THE DOCK HAD NOT MR. COPE THE GOVERNOR OF NEWGATE RESTRAINED HER
LJ014-0140 AFTER JUDGMENT WAS PASSED SHE REPEATEDLY CRIED OUT SHAME
LJ014-0141 AND STRETCHING OUT HER HAND SHE GATHERED UP A QUANTITY OF THE RUE WHICH FOLLOWING ANCIENT CUSTOM DATING FROM THE DAYS OF THE JAIL FEVER
LJ014-0142 WAS STREWN IN FRONT OF THE DOCK AND SPRINKLED IT TOWARDS THE BENCH WITH A CONTEMPTUOUS GESTURE
LJ014-0143 ON BEING REMOVED TO NEWGATE FROM THE COURT MRS. MANNING BECAME PERFECTLY FURIOUS
LJ014-0144 SHE UTTERED LOUD IMPRECATIONS CURSING JUDGE JURY BARRISTERS WITNESSES AND ALL WHO STOOD AROUND
LJ014-0146 THEY HAD TO HANDCUFF HER BY FORCE AGAINST THE MOST VIOLENT RESISTANCE AND STILL SHE RAGED AND STORMED
LJ014-0147 SHAKING HER CLENCHED AND MANACLED HANDS IN THE OFFICERS' FACES
LJ014-0148 FROM NEWGATE THE MANNINGS WERE TAKEN IN SEPARATE CABS TO HORSEMONGER LANE JAIL
LJ014-0149 ON THIS JOURNEY HER MANNER CHANGED COMPLETELY SHE BECAME FLIPPANT JOKED WITH THE OFFICERS ASKED HOW THEY LIKED HER RESOLUTION IN THE DOCK
LJ014-0150 AND EXPRESSED THE UTMOST CONTEMPT FOR HER HUSBAND WHOM SHE NEVER INTENDED TO ACKNOWLEDGE OR SPEAK TO AGAIN
LJ014-0151 LATER HER MOOD CHANGED TO ABJECT DESPAIR
LJ014-0152 ON REACHING THE CONDEMNED CELL SHE THREW HERSELF UPON THE FLOOR AND SHRIEKED IN AN HYSTERICAL AGONY OF TEARS
LJ014-0153 AFTER THIS UNTIL THE DAY OF EXECUTION SHE RECOVERED HER SPIRITS AND DISPLAYED RECKLESS EFFRONTERY
LJ014-0154 MOCKING AT THE CHAPLAIN AND TURNING A DEAF EAR TO THE COUNSELS OF A BENEVOLENT LADY WHO CAME TO VISIT
LJ014-0155 NOW SHE ABUSED THE JURY NOW CALLED MANNING A VAGABOND
LJ014-0156 AND THROUGH ALL ATE HEARTILY AT EVERY MEAL SLEPT SOUNDLY AT NIGHTS AND TALKED WITH CHEERFULNESS ON ALMOST ANY SUBJECT
LJ014-0157 NEVERTHELESS SHE ATTEMPTED TO COMMIT SUICIDE BY DRIVING HER NAILS PURPOSELY LEFT LONG INTO HER THROAT
LJ014-0158 SHE WAS DISCOVERED JUST AS SHE WAS GETTING BLACK IN THE FACE
LJ014-0159 MANNING'S DEMEANOR WAS MORE IN HARMONY WITH HIS SITUATION AND THE FULL CONFESSION HE MADE
LJ014-0160 ELUCIDATED ALL DARK AND UNCERTAIN POINTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE CRIME
LJ014-0161 THE ACTUAL EXECUTION WHICH TOOK PLACE AT ANOTHER PRISON THAN NEWGATE IS RATHER BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THIS WORK
LJ014-0162 BUT IT MAY BE MENTIONED THAT THE CONCOURSE WAS SO ENORMOUS THAT IT DREW DOWN THE WELLMERITED AND TRENCHANT DISAPPROVAL OF CHARLES DICKENS
LJ014-0163 WHO WROTE TO THE 'TIMES' SAYING THAT HE BELIEVED A SIGHT SO INCONCEIVABLY AWFUL
LJ014-0164 AS THE WICKEDNESS AND LEVITY OF THE IMMENSE CROWD COLLECTED AT THE EXECUTION THIS MORNING COULD BE IMAGINED BY NO MAN
LJ014-0165 AND PRESENTED BY NO HEATHEN LAND UNDER THE SUN
LJ014-0166 FADED IN MY MIND BEFORE THE ATROCIOUS BEARING LOOKS AND LANGUAGE OF THE ASSEMBLED SPECTATORS
LJ014-0167 WHEN I CAME UPON THE SCENE AT MIDNIGHT THE SHRILLNESS OF THE CRIES AND HOWLS THAT WERE RAISED FROM TIME TO TIME
LJ014-0168 DENOTING THAT THEY CAME FROM A CONCOURSE OF BOYS AND GIRLS ALREADY ASSEMBLED IN THE BEST PLACES MADE MY BLOOD RUN COLD
LJ014-0169 IT WILL BE IN THE MEMORY OF MANY THAT MRS. MANNING APPEARED ON THE SCAFFOLD IN A BLACK SATIN DRESS WHICH WAS BOUND TIGHTLY ROUND HER WAIST
LJ014-0170 THIS PREFERENCE BROUGHT THE COSTLY STUFF INTO DISREPUTE AND ITS UNPOPULARITY LASTED FOR NEARLY THIRTY YEARS
LJ014-0171 I WILL BRIEFLY DESCRIBE ONE OR TWO OF THE MORE REMARKABLE MURDERS IN THE YEARS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THEN PASS ON TO ANOTHER BRANCH OF CRIME
LJ014-0172 ROBERT MARLEY AT THE TIME OF HIS ARREST CALLED HIMSELF A SURGICAL INSTRUMENT MAKER
LJ014-0173 IT WAS UNDERSTOOD ALSO THAT HE HAD SERVED IN THE ARMY AS A PRIVATE AND HAD MOREOVER UNDERGONE A SENTENCE OF TRANSPORTATION
LJ014-0174 BUT IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT HE HAD BEEN ONCE IN A GOOD POSITION WELL BORN AND WELL EDUCATED
LJ014-0175 WHEN LYING UNDER SENTENCE OF DEATH IN NEWGATE HE WAS VISITED BY A LADY A GENTLEWOMAN IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD WHO WAS SAID TO BE HIS SISTER
LJ014-0176 HIS DETERMINED ADDICTION TO EVIL COURSES HAD LED TO HIS BEING CAST OFF BY HIS FAMILY
LJ014-0177 AND HE MUST HAVE BEEN AT THE END OF HIS RESOURCES WHEN HE COMMITTED THE CRIME FOR WHICH HE SUFFERED
LJ014-0178 HIS OFFENSE WAS THE MURDER OF RICHARD COPE
LJ014-0179 A WORKING JEWELER SHOPMAN TO A MR. BERRY OF PARLIAMENT STREET. IT WAS COPE'S DUTY TO STAY IN THE SHOP TILL THE LAST CLOSE THE SHUTTERS
LJ014-0180 SECURE THE STOCK OF WATCHES AND JEWELRY THEN LOCK UP THE PLACE AND TAKE ON THE KEYS TO MR. BERRY'S PRIVATE HOUSE IN PIMLICO
LJ014-0181 COPE A SMALL MAN CRIPPLED AND OF WEAKLY CONSTITUTION WAS ALONE IN THE SHOP ABOUT 930
LJ014-0182 THE SHUTTERS WERE UP AND HE WAS PREPARING TO CLOSE WHEN MARLEY ENTERED AND FELL UPON HIM WITH A LIFEPRESERVER
LJ014-0183 MEANING TO KILL HIM AND RIFLE THE SHOP
LJ014-0184 THE NOISE OF THE STRUGGLE WAS HEARD OUTSIDE IN THE STREET
LJ014-0185 AND BYSTANDERS PEEPED IN THROUGH THE SHUTTERS BUT NO ONE ENTERED OR SOUGHT TO INTERFERE IN WHAT SEEMED ONLY A DOMESTIC QUARREL
LJ014-0186 A MILLINER'S PORTER
LJ014-0187 LERIGO WAS ALSO ATTRACTED BY THE NOISE OF THE ROW BUT AFTER WALKING A FEW PACES HE FELT DISSATISFIED AND RETURNED TO THE SPOT
LJ014-0188 PUSHING THE SHOPDOOR OPEN HE SAW MARLEY FINISHING HIS MURDEROUS ASSAULT
LJ014-0189 LERIGO TURNED FOR ASSISTANCE TO TAKE THE MAN INTO CUSTODY
LJ014-0190 MARLEY DISTURBED PICKED UP A CIGAR AND PARCEL FROM THE COUNTER THEN RAN OUT PURSUED BY LERIGO ONLY
LJ014-0191 MARLEY RAN ALONG THE STREET DOWN INTO CANNON ROW
LJ014-0192 THEN INTO PALACE YARD WHERE THE WATERMAN OF THE CABTANK IN OBEDIENCE TO LERIGO'S SHOUTS COLLARED THE FUGITIVE
LJ014-0193 ESCORTED BY HIS TWO CAPTORS MARLEY WAS TAKEN BACK INTO PARLIAMENT STREET TO THE JEWELER'S SHOP
LJ014-0194 THE POLICEMEN WERE NOW IN POSSESSION
LJ014-0195 TWO OF THEM SUPPORTED COPE WHO WAS STILL ALIVE ALTHOUGH INSENSIBLE AND MARLEY WAS APPREHENDED. THE EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM WAS COMPLETED
LJ014-0196 BY HIS IDENTIFICATION BY COPE IN WESTMINSTER HOSPITAL WHO SURVIVED LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE A FORMAL DEPOSITION BEFORE MR. JARDINE
LJ014-0197 THE POLICE MAGISTRATE THAT MARLEY WAS THE MAN WHO HAD BEATEN HIM TO DEATH
LJ014-0198 MARLEY AT HIS TRIAL WAS UNDEFENDED AND THE SHERIFFS OFFERED HIM COUNSEL BUT HE DECLINED. THE WITNESSES AGAINST HIM ALL SPOKE THE TRUTH HE SAID
LJ014-0199 THERE WAS NO CASE TO MAKE OUT WHY WASTE MONEY ON LAWYERS FOR THE DEFENSE HIS DEMEANOR WAS COOL AND COLLECTED THROUGHOUT
LJ014-0200 HE SEEMED WHILE IN NEWGATE TO REALIZE THOROUGHLY THAT THERE WAS NO HOPE FOR HIM AND WAS DETERMINED TO FACE HIS FATE BRAVELY
LJ014-0201 AFTER SENTENCE THE NEWGATE OFFICERS WHO HAD SPECIAL CHARGE OF HIM NOTICED THAT HE SLEPT WELL AND ATE WELL ENJOYING ALL HIS MEALS
LJ014-0202 ONE OF THEM WENT INTO HIS CELL JUST AT DINNERTIME
LJ014-0203 THE GREAT CLOCK OF ST. SEPULCHRE'S CLOSE BY WAS STRIKING THE HOUR AND MARLEY WHO HAD HIS ELBOWS ON THE TABLE
LJ014-0204 WITH HIS HEAD RESTING ON HIS HANDS LOOKED UP AND OBSERVED CALMLY GO ALONG CLOCK COME ALONG GALLOWS
LJ014-0205 ON THE DREAD MORNING HE CAME OUT TO EXECUTION QUITE GAILY AND TRIPPED UP THE STAIRS TO THE SCAFFOLD
LJ014-0206 HIS CAPTORS IT MAY BE ADDED LERIGO AND ALLEN WERE WARMLY COMMENDED BY THE JUDGE FOR THEIR COURAGE AND ACTIVITY
LJ014-0207 THE FORMER WAS GIVEN A REWARD OF TWENTY AND THE LATTER OF TEN POUNDS
LJ014-0208 A MURDEROUS ASSAULT ON A POLICE CONSTABLE WHICH SO NEARLY ENDED FATALLY THAT THE CULPRIT WAS SENTENCED TO DEATH ALTHOUGH NOT EXECUTED
LJ014-0209 WAS PERPETRATED IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE THE CASE WAS ACCOMPANIED WITH THE MOST SHOCKING BRUTALITY
LJ014-0210 CANNON BY TRADE A CHIMNEYSWEEP HAD LONG BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY THE BITTEREST HATRED OF THE POLICE FORCE
LJ014-0211 AND HAD BEEN REPEATEDLY SENTENCED TO IMPRISONMENT FOR MOST DESPERATE AND FEROCIOUS ATTACKS UPON VARIOUS CONSTABLES. HIS LAST VICTIM WAS DWYER
LJ014-0212 A FINE YOUNG OFFICER WHO HAD BEEN SUMMONED TO TAKE CANNON INTO CUSTODY WHEN THE LATTER WAS DRUNK AND RIOTOUS IN FRONT OF A PUBLICHOUSE
LJ014-0213 DWYER FOUND CANNON BLEEDING PROFUSELY FROM A WOUND IN THE HEAD AND PERSUADED HIM TO GO TO A DOCTOR'S
LJ014-0214 THEY WALKED TOGETHER QUIETLY FOR SOME LITTLE DISTANCE THEN CANNON WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST WARNING
LJ014-0215 THREW THE CONSTABLE ON HIS BACK AND VIOLENTLY ASSAULTED HIM BY JUMPING ON HIS CHEST AND STOMACH
LJ014-0216 AND BY GETTING HIS HAND INSIDE DWYER'S STOCK WITH THE IDEA OF STRANGLING HIM
LJ014-0217 DWYER MANAGED TO OVERPOWER HIS ASSAILANT AND GOT TO HIS FEET BUT CANNON BUTTED AT HIM WITH HIS HEAD AND AGAIN THREW HIM TO THE GROUND
LJ014-0218 AFTER WHICH HE KICKED HIS PROSTRATE FOE IN THE MOST BRUTAL AND COWARDLY MANNER AND UNTIL HE WAS ALMOST SENSELESS AND BRUISED FROM HEAD TO FOOT
LJ014-0219 ONCE MORE DWYER GOT TO HIS FEET AND MANAGED BY DRAWING HIS STAFF TO KEEP CANNON AT BAY UNTIL A SECOND CONSTABLE CAME TO HIS AID
LJ014-0220 ALL THIS TIME NOT ONE OF A NUMEROUS BODY OF BYSTANDERS OFFERED TO ASSIST THE POLICEMAN IN HIS EXTREMITY
LJ014-0221 ON THE CONTRARY MANY OF THEM ENCOURAGED THE BRUTAL ASSAILANT IN HIS SAVAGE ATTACK
LJ014-0222 TO CANNON'S INFINITE SURPRISE HE WAS INDICTED FOR ATTEMPT TO MURDER AND NOT FOR A SIMPLE ASSAULT AND FOUND GUILTY
LJ014-0223 THE JUDGE IN PASSING SENTENCE OF DEATH TOLD HIM HE RICHLY DESERVED THE PUNISHMENT
LJ014-0224 AS DWYER SURVIVED CANNON ESCAPED THE DEATH SENTENCE WHICH WAS COMMUTED TO PENAL SERVITUDE FOR LIFE
LJ014-0225 A HANDSOME SUM WAS SUBSCRIBED FOR THE INJURED CONSTABLE WHO WAS DISABLED FOR LIFE
LJ014-0226 ONLY A FEW HAVE VIED WITH CANNON IN FIENDISH CRUELTY AND BRUTALITY
LJ014-0227 ONE OF THESE WAS MOBBS WHO LIVED IN THE MINORIES
LJ014-0228 GENERALLY KNOWN BY THE SOUBRIQUET OF GENERAL HAYNAU A NAME EXECRATED IN ENGLAND ABOUT THIS TIME
LJ014-0229 MOBBS SYSTEMATICALLY ILLUSED HIS WIFE FOR A LONG SPACE OF TIME AND AT LAST CUT HER THROAT
LJ014-0230 FOR THIS HE WAS EXECUTED IN FRONT OF NEWGATE IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY THREE
LJ014-0231 EMMANUEL BARTHELEMY AGAIN
LJ014-0232 THE FRENCH REFUGEE WAS A MURDERER OF THE SAME DESCRIPTION WHO DISPATCHED HIS VICTIM WITH A LOADED CANE AFTER WHICH TO SECURE HIS ESCAPE
LJ014-0233 HE SHOT AN OLD SOLDIER WHO HAD ATTEMPTED TO DETAIN HIM. HE WAS CONVICTED AND EXECUTED
LJ014-0234 HE DIED IMPENITENT DECLARING THAT HE HAD NO BELIEF AND THAT IT WAS IDLE TO ASK FORGIVENESS OF GOD
LJ014-0235 I WANT FORGIVENESS OF MAN I WANT THOSE DOORS OF THE PRISON OPENED
LJ014-0236 BARTHELEMY WAS GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN A SECRET AGENT OF THE FRENCH POLICE
LJ014-0237 I WILL NOW PASS TO GRAVE BUT LESS ATROCIOUS CRIMES
LJ014-0238 IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY OCCURRED THE FIRST OF A SERIES OF GIGANTIC FRAUDS
LJ014-0239 WHICH FOLLOWED EACH OTHER AT NO LONG INTERVALS WHICH HAD A STRONG FAMILY LIKENESS AND ORIGINATED ALL OF THEM TO MAKE MONEY EASILY
LJ014-0240 WITHOUT CAPITAL AND AT RAILROAD SPEED
LJ014-0241 WALTER WATTS WAS AN INVENTOR A CREATOR WHO STRUCK AN ENTIRELY NEW AND ORIGINAL LINE OF CRIME
LJ014-0242 EMPLOYED AS A CLERK IN THE GLOBE ASSURANCE
LJ014-0243 HE WITH UNUSUAL QUICKNESS OF APPREHENSION DISCOVERED AND PROMPTLY TURNED TO ACCOUNT AN INEXCUSABLY LAX SYSTEM OF MANAGEMENT
LJ014-0244 WHICH OFFERED PECULIAR CHANCES OF PROFIT TO AN INGENIOUS AND UNSCRUPULOUS MAN
LJ014-0245 IT WAS THE CUSTOM IN THIS OFFICE TO MAKE THE BANKER'S PASSBOOK THE BASIS OF THE ENTRIES IN THE COMPANY'S LEDGERS
LJ014-0246 THUS WHEN A PAYMENT WAS MADE BY THE COMPANY THE AMOUNT DISBURSED WAS CARRIED TO ACCOUNT IN THE GENERAL BOOKS FROM ITS ENTRY IN THE PASSBOOK
LJ014-0247 AND WITHOUT REFERENCE TO OR COMPARISON WITH THE DOCUMENTS IN WHICH THE PAYMENT WAS CLAIMED
LJ014-0248 THIS PASSBOOK WHEN NOT AT THE BANK WAS IN THE EXCLUSIVE CUSTODY OF WATTS
LJ014-0249 THE CHEQUES DRAWN BY THE DIRECTORS ALSO PASSED THROUGH HIS HANDS TO HIM TOO THEY CAME BACK TO BE VERIFIED AND PUT BY
LJ014-0250 AFTER THEY HAD BEEN CASHED BY THE BANK
LJ014-0251 IN THIS WAY WATTS HAD COMPLETE CONTROL OVER THE WHOLE OF THE MONETARY TRANSACTIONS OF THE COMPANY
LJ014-0252 HE COULD DO WHAT HE LIKED WITH THE PASSBOOK AND BY ITS ADOPTION AS DESCRIBED AS THE BASIS OF ALL ENTRIES
LJ014-0253 THERE WAS NO INDEPENDENT CHECK UPON HIM IF HE CHOSE TO TAMPER WITH IT
LJ014-0254 THIS HE DID TO AN ENORMOUS EXTENT
LJ014-0255 CONTINUALLY ALTERING ERASING AND ADDING FIGURES TO CORRESPOND WITH AND COVER THE ABSTRACTIONS HE MADE OF VARIOUS CHEQUES AS THEY WERE DRAWN
LJ014-0256 IT SEEMS INCREDIBLE THAT THIS PASSBOOK WHICH WHEN PRODUCED IN COURT
LJ014-0257 WAS A MASS OF BLOTS AND ERASURES SHOULD NOT HAVE CREATED SUSPICION OF FOUL PLAY EITHER AT THE BANK OR AT THE COMPANY'S BOARD
LJ014-0258 IMPLICIT CONFIDENCE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN PLACED IN WATTS WHO WAS THE SON OF AN OLD AND TRUSTED EMPLOYEE AND MOREOVER A YOUNG MAN OF PLAUSIBLE ADDRESS
LJ014-0259 WATTS LED TWO LIVES
LJ014-0260 IN THE WEST END HE WAS A MAN OF FASHION WITH A TOWN HOUSE A HOUSE AT BRIGHTON AND A CELLAR FULL OF GOOD WINE AT BOTH
LJ014-0261 HE RODE A PRICELESS HACK IN ROTTEN ROW OR DROVE DOWN TO RICHMOND IN A MAIL PHAETON AND PAIR
LJ014-0262 HE PLAYED HIGH AND SPENT HIS NIGHTS AT THE CLUB OR IN JOYOUS AND DISSOLUTE COMPANY
LJ014-0263 WHEN OTHER PLEASURES PALLED HE TOOK A THEATRE AND POSED AS A MUNIFICENT PATRON OF THE DRAMATIC ART
LJ014-0264 UNDER HIS AUSPICES SEVERAL STARS APPEARED ON THE BOARDS OF THE MARYLEBONE THEATRE
LJ014-0265 AND LATER HE BECAME MANAGER OF THE NEWLY REBUILT OLYMPIC AT WYCH STREET
LJ014-0266 NO ONE CARED TOO CLOSELY TO INQUIRE INTO THE SOURCES OF WEALTH. SOME SAID HE WAS A FORTUNATE SPECULATOR IN STOCKS
LJ014-0267 OTHERS THAT HE HAD HAD EXTRAORDINARY LUCK AS A GOLDDIGGER. HAD HIS WEST END AND LITTLEINFORMED ASSOCIATES FOLLOWED HIM INTO THE CITY
LJ014-0268 WHITHER HE WAS TAKEN EVERY MORNING IN A SMART BROUGHAM THEY WOULD HAVE SEEN HIM ALIGHT FROM IT IN CORNHILL
LJ014-0269 AND WALK FORWARD ON FOOT TO ENTER AS A HUMBLE AND UNPRETENDING EMPLOYEE THE DOORS OF THE GLOBE ASSURANCE OFFICE
LJ014-0271 NEVERTHELESS IN THIS POSITION THROUGH THE CULPABLE CARELESSNESS WHICH LEFT HIM UNFETTERED HE MANAGED BETWEEN 1844
LJ014-0272 AND EIGHTEEN FIFTY TO EMBEZZLE AND APPLY TO HIS OWN PURPOSES SOME £71000
LJ014-0273 THE DETECTION OF THESE FRAUDS CAME WHILE HE WAS STILL PROMINENTLY BEFORE THE WORLD AS THE LESSEE OF THE OLYMPIC
LJ014-0274 RUMORS WERE ABROAD THAT SERIOUS DEFALCATIONS HAD BEEN DISCOVERED IN ONE OF THE INSURANCE OFFICES
LJ014-0275 BUT IT WAS LONG BEFORE THE PUBLIC REALIZED THAT THE FRAUDULENT CLERK AND THE GREAT THEATRICAL MANAGER WERE ONE AND THE SAME PERSON
LJ014-0276 WATTS'S CRIME WAS DISCOVERED BY THE SECRETARY OF THE GLOBE COMPANY WHO CAME SUDDENLY UPON THE EXTENSIVE FALSIFICATION OF THE PASSBOOK
LJ014-0277 AN INQUIRY WAS AT ONCE SET ON FOOT AND THE FRAUDS WERE TRACED TO WATTS
LJ014-0278 THE LATTER WHEN FIRST TAXED WITH HIS OFFENSE PROTESTED HIS INNOCENCE BOLDLY AND POSITIVELY DENIED ALL KNOWLEDGE OF THE AFFAIR
LJ014-0279 AND HE HAD SO CLEVERLY DESTROYED ALL TRACES THAT IT WAS NOT EASY TO BRING HOME THE CHARGE
LJ014-0280 BUT IT WAS PROVED THAT WATTS HAD APPROPRIATED ONE CHEQUE FOR £1400
LJ014-0281 WHICH HE HAD PAID INTO HIS OWN BANKERS AND ON THIS HE WAS COMMITTED TO NEWGATE FOR TRIAL
LJ014-0282 THERE WERE TWO COUNTS IN THE INDICTMENT ONE FOR STEALING A CHEQUE VALUE £1400 THE SECOND FOR STEALING A BIT OF PAPER VALUE ONE PENNY
LJ014-0283 THE JURY FOUND HIM GUILTY OF THE LATTER ONLY WITH A POINT OF LAW RESERVED. THIS WAS FULLY ARGUED BEFORE THREE JUDGES
LJ014-0285 AND NOT FOR THE SLIGHT OFFENSE AS IT APPEARED ON THE RECORD
LJ014-0286 THE SENTENCE OF THE COURT ONE OF TEN YEARS' TRANSPORTATION STRUCK THE PRISONER WITH DISMAY
LJ014-0287 HE HAD BEEN LED TO SUPPOSE THAT TWELVE MONTHS' IMPRISONMENT WAS THE UTMOST THE LAW COULD INFLICT AND HE BROKE DOWN UTTERLY UNDER THE UNEXPECTED BLOW
LJ014-0288 THAT SAME EVENING HE COMMITTED SUICIDE IN NEWGATE
LJ014-0289 THE DETAILS OF THE SUICIDE WERE GIVEN AT THE INQUEST WATTS HAD BEEN IN ILLHEALTH FROM THE TIME OF HIS FIRST ARREST
LJ014-0290 IN GILTSPUR STREET COMPTER WHERE HE WAS FIRST LODGED
LJ014-0291 HE SHOWED SYMPTOMS OF DELIRIUM TREMENS AND ADMITTED THAT HE HAD BEEN ADDICTED TO THE EXCESSIVE USE OF STIMULANTS
LJ014-0292 HIS HEALTH IMPROVED BUT WAS STILL INDIFFERENT WHEN HE WAS BROUGHT UP FOR SENTENCE AND HE WAS AN OCCUPANT OF THE NEWGATE INFIRMARY
LJ014-0293 HE RETURNED FROM COURT IN A STATE OF GLOOMY DEJECTION
LJ014-0294 AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT ONE OF THE FELLOWPRISONERS WHO SLEPT IN THE SAME WARD NOTICED THAT HE WAS NOT IN HIS BED
LJ014-0295 THIS MAN GOT UP TO LOOK FOR HIM AND FOUND HIM HANGING FROM THE BARS OF A NEIGHBORING ROOM
LJ014-0296 HE HAD MADE USE OF A PIECE OF ROPE CUT OUT FROM THE SACKING OF HIS BEDSTEAD AND HAD TIED HIS FEET TOGETHER WITH A SILK POCKETHANDKERCHIEF
LJ014-0297 THE PRISON OFFICERS WERE CALLED BUT WATTS WAS QUITE COLD AND STIFF WHEN HE WAS CUT DOWN
LJ014-0298 STRANGE TO SAY A SECOND SUICIDE OCCURRED IN NEWGATE THE SAME NIGHT
LJ014-0299 THAT OF A PRIZEFIGHTER NAMED DONOVAN TRIED THE SAME DAY AND CONVICTED OF MANSLAUGHTER
LJ014-0300 SENTENCE OF DEATH HAD BEEN RECORDED AGAINST DONOVAN WHO LIKE WATTS HAD SEEMINGLY BEEN OVERCOME WITH SUDDEN DESPAIR
LJ014-0301 IN 1853 A SECOND CASE OF GIGANTIC FRAUD ALARMED AND SCANDALIZED THE FINANCIAL WORLD
LJ014-0302 IT OUTSHONE THE DEFALCATIONS OF WATTS
LJ014-0303 NOTHING TO EQUAL THE EXCITEMENT CAUSED BY THE FORGERIES OF ROBERT FERDINAND PRIES HAD BEEN KNOWN BEFORE IN THE CITY OF LONDON
LJ014-0304 HE WAS A CORN MERCHANT WHO OPERATED LARGELY IN GRAIN
LJ014-0305 SO ENORMOUS WERE HIS TRANSACTIONS THAT THEY OFTEN AFFECTED THE MARKETS AND CAUSED GREAT FLUCTUATIONS IN PRICES
LJ014-0306 THESE HAD BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO POLITICAL ACTION SOME THOUGHT THAT THE LARGE PURCHASES IN FOREIGN GRAINS EFFECTED AT LOSING PRICES
LJ014-0307 WERE INTENDED BY THE PROTECTIONISTS TO DEPRESS THE WHEAT MARKET AND SECURE THE SUPPORT OF THE FARMERS AT THE FORTHCOMING ELECTION
LJ014-0308 OTHERS THAT NAPOLEON III. BUT RECENTLY PROCLAIMED EMPEROR OF THE FRENCH WISHED TO GAIN THE POPULARITY NECESSARY TO SECURE THE PEOPLE
LJ014-0309 FEW REALIZED THAT THESE MYSTERIOUS OPERATIONS WERE THE CONVULSIVE ATTEMPT OF A RUINED AND DISHONEST SPECULATOR TO SUSTAIN HIS CREDIT
LJ014-0310 PRIES ALTHOUGH ENJOYING A HIGH REPUTATION IN THE CITY HAD LONG BEEN IN A BAD WAY
LJ014-0311 HIS EXTENSIVE BUSINESS HAD BEEN CARRIED ON BY FRAUD
LJ014-0312 HIS METHOD WAS TO OBTAIN ADVANCES TWICE OVER ON THE SAME BILLS OF LADING OR CORN WARRANTS. THE DUPLICATES WERE FORGED
LJ014-0313 IN THIS WAY HE OBTAINED VAST SUMS FROM SEVERAL FIRMS AND ONE TO WHICH HE WAS INDEBTED UPWARDS OF £50000 SUBSEQUENTLY STOPPED PAYMENT
LJ014-0314 PRIES AT LENGTH WAS DISCOVERED
LJ014-0315 THROUGH A DISHONORED CHEQUE FOR £3000 PAID OVER AS AN INSTALLMENT OF £18000 OWING FOR AN ADVANCE ON WARRANTS
LJ014-0316 INQUIRIES WERE INSTITUTED WHEN THE CHEQUE WAS PROTESTED WHICH LED TO THE DISCOVERY OF THE FORGERIES
LJ014-0317 PRIES WAS LODGED IN NEWGATE TRIED AT THE OLD BAILEY AND TRANSPORTED FOR LIFE
LJ014-0318 ANOTHER SET OF FRAUDS WHICH RESEMBLED THOSE OF PRIES IN PRINCIPLE ALTHOUGH NOT IN PRACTICE WERE SOON AFTERWARDS DISCOVERED
LJ014-0320 PROPOSED TO GAIN THE CAPITAL HE NEEDED FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES BY RAISING MONEY ON DOCK WARRANTS FOR IMPORTED GOODS WHICH HAD NO REAL EXISTENCE
LJ014-0321 WHEN SUCH GOODS ARRIVED THEY WERE FREQUENTLY LEFT AT A WHARF PAYING RENT UNTIL IT SUITED THE IMPORTER TO REMOVE THEM
LJ014-0322 THE DOCK WARRANT WAS ISSUED BY THE WHARFINGER AS CERTIFICATE THAT HE HELD THE GOODS
LJ014-0323 THE WARRANT THUS REPRESENTED MONEY AND WAS OFTEN USED AS SUCH BEING ENDORSED AND PASSED FROM HAND TO HAND AS OTHER NEGOTIABLE BILLS
LJ014-0324 COLE'S PLAN WAS TO HAVE A WHARF OF HIS OWN NOMINALLY OCCUPIED BY A CREATURE TRADING AS MALTBY AND CO
LJ014-0325 GOODS WOULD BE LANDED AT THIS WHARF
LJ014-0326 MALTBY AND CO. WOULD ISSUE WARRANTS ON THEM DELIVERABLE TO THE IMPORTER AND THE GOODS WERE THEN PASSED TO BE STORED IN NEIGHBORING WAREHOUSES
LJ014-0327 THE OWNERS OF THE LATTER WOULD THEN ISSUE A SECOND SET OF WARRANTS ON THESE GOODS IN TOTAL IGNORANCE OF THE FACT THAT THEY WERE ALREADY PLEDGED
LJ014-0328 COLE QUICKLY RAISED MONEY ON BOTH SETS OF WARRANTS. HE CARRIED ON THIS GAME FOR SOME TIME WITH GREAT SUCCESS
LJ014-0329 AND SO DEVELOPED HIS BUSINESS THAT IN ONE YEAR HIS TRANSACTIONS AMOUNTED TO A COUPLE OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS
LJ014-0330 HE HAD SEVERAL NARROW ESCAPES
LJ014-0331 ONCE A WARRANTHOLDER SENT DOWN A CLERK TO VIEW CERTAIN GOODS AND THE CLERK FOUND THAT THESE GOODS HAD ALREADY A STOP UPON THEM OR WERE PLEDGED
LJ014-0332 COLE ESCAPED BY THROWING THE BLAME ON A CARELESS PARTNER AND AT ONCE REMOVED THE STOP
LJ014-0333 AGAIN SOME OF THE DUPLICATE AND FICTITIOUS WARRANTS WERE HELD BY A FIRM WHICH SUSPENDED PAYMENT AND THERE WAS NO KNOWING INTO WHOSE HANDS THEY MIGHT FALL
LJ014-0334 COLE FOUND OUT WHERE THEY WERE AND REDEEMED THEM AT A HEAVY OUTLAY THUS OBTAINING BUSINESS RELATIONS WITH THE FIRM THAT HELD THEM
LJ014-0335 WHICH WERE SOON DEVELOPED MUCH TO THAT FIRM'S SUBSEQUENT ANGER AND REGRET
LJ014-0336 LAST OF ALL THE WELLKNOWN BANKERS OVEREND AND GURNEY WHOSE OWN AFFAIRS CREATED MUCH EXCITEMENT SOME YEARS LATER
LJ014-0337 WISHING TO VERIFY THE VALUE OF WARRANTS THEY HELD AND SENDING TO MALTBY AND CO.'S WHARF FOUND OUT HALF THE TRUTH
LJ014-0338 THESE BANKERS WISHING FOR MORE SPECIFIC INFORMATION
LJ014-0339 ASKED DAVIDSON AND GORDON A FIRM WITH WHICH COLE WAS CLOSELY ALLIED WHETHER THE WARRANTS MEANT GOODS OR NOTHING
LJ014-0340 THEY COULD NOT DENY THAT THE LATTER WAS THE TRUTH AND WERE FORTHWITH STIGMATIZED BY MR. CHAPMAN OVEREND AND GURNEY'S REPRESENTATIVE AS ROGUES
LJ015-0001 CHRONICLES OF NEWGATE VOLUME TWO BY ARTHUR GRIFFITHS SECTION EIGHTEEN NEWGATE NOTORIETIES CONTINUED PART 3
LJ015-0002 THE COURSE OF THE SWINDLERS WAS BY NO MEANS SMOOTH BUT IT WAS NOT TILL EIGHTEEN FIFTY FOUR THAT SUSPICION AROSE THAT ANYTHING WAS WRONG
LJ015-0003 A FIRM WHICH HELD A LOT OF WARRANTS SUDDENLY DEMANDED THE DELIVERY OF THE GOODS THEY COVERED
LJ015-0004 THE GOODS HAVING NO EXISTENCE COLE OF COURSE COULD NOT DELIVER THEM
LJ015-0005 ABOUT THIS TIME DAVIDSON AND GORDON THE PEOPLE ABOVEMENTIONED
LJ015-0006 WHO HAD FRAUDULENT WARRANTS OUT OF THEIR OWN TO THE EXTENT OF £150000 SUSPENDED PAYMENT AND ABSCONDED
LJ015-0007 THIS AFFECTED COLE'S CREDIT AND UGLY REPORTS WERE IN CIRCULATION CHARGING HIM WITH THE ISSUE OF SIMULATED WARRANTS
LJ015-0008 THESE INDEED WERE OUT TO THE VALUE OF £367800
LJ015-0009 COLE'S DIFFICULTIES INCREASED MORE AND MORE WARRANTHOLDERS CAME DOWN UPON HIM DEMANDING TO REALIZE THEIR GOODS
LJ015-0010 COLE NOW SUSPENDED PAYMENT
LJ015-0011 MALTBY WHO HAD BOLTED WAS PURSUED AND ARRESTED TO END HIS LIFE MISERABLY BY COMMITTING SUICIDE IN A NEWGATE CELL
LJ015-0012 COLE TOO WAS APPREHENDED AND IN DUE COURSE TRIED AT THE CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT
LJ015-0013 HE WAS FOUND GUILTY AND SENTENCED TO THE SEEMINGLY INADEQUATE PUNISHMENT OF FOUR YEARS' TRANSPORTATION
LJ015-0014 DAVIDSON AND GORDON WERE ALSO SENTENCED TO IMPRISONMENT
LJ015-0015 A MORE DISTRESSING CASE STANDS NEXT ON THE CRIMINAL RECORDS 
LJ015-0016 THE FAILURE AND SUBSEQUENT SENTENCE OF THE BANKERS MESSRS. STRAHAN PAUL AND BATES
LJ015-0017 FOR THE FRAUDULENT DISPOSAL OF SECURITIES LODGED IN THEIR HANDS. THIS FIRM WAS ONE OF THE OLDEST BANKING ESTABLISHMENTS IN THE KINGDOM
LJ015-0018 AND DATED BACK TO THE COMMONWEALTH WHEN UNDER THE TITLE OF SNOW AND WALTON IT CARRIED ON BUSINESS AS PAWNBROKERS
LJ015-0019 THE STRAHAN OF THE FIRM WHICH CAME TO GRIEF WAS A SNOW WHO CHANGED HIS NAME FOR A FORTUNE OF £200000
LJ015-0020 HE WAS A MAN ESTEEMED AND RESPECTED IN SOCIETY AND THE WORLD OF FINANCE INCAPABLE AS IT WAS THOUGHT OF A DISHONEST DEED
LJ015-0021 SIR JOHN DEAN PAUL HAD INHERITED A BARONETCY FROM HIS FATHER TOGETHER WITH AN HONORED NAME
LJ015-0022 HE WAS HIMSELF A PROMINENT MEMBER OF THE LOW CHURCH OF AUSTERE PIETY ACTIVE IN ALL GOOD WORKS
LJ015-0023 MR. BATES HAD BEEN CONFIDENTIAL MANAGING CLERK AND WAS TAKEN INTO THE FIRM NOT ALONE AS A REWARD FOR LONG AND FAITHFUL SERVICE
LJ015-0024 BUT THAT HE MIGHT STRENGTHEN IT BY HIS LONG EXPERIENCE AND KNOWN BUSINESS CAPACITY
LJ015-0025 THE BANK ENJOYED AN EXCELLENT REPUTATION IT HAD A GOOD CONNECTION AND WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PERFECTLY SOUND
LJ015-0026 MOREOVER THE PARTNERS WERE SOBER STEADY MEN WHO PAID UNREMITTING ATTENTION TO BUSINESS
LJ015-0027 YET EVEN SO EARLY AS THE DEATH OF THE FIRST SIR JOHN PAUL
LJ015-0028 THE BANK WAS INSOLVENT AND INSTEAD OF STARTING ON A FRESH LIFE WITH A NEW NAME IT SHOULD THEN AND THERE HAVE CLOSED ITS DOORS
LJ015-0029 IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE THE BALANCE SHEET SHOWED A DEFICIENCY OF UPWARDS OF £70000
LJ015-0030 THE BANK HAD BEEN CONDUCTED ON FALSE PRINCIPLES
LJ015-0031 IT HAD ASSUMED ENORMOUS RESPONSIBILITIES  ON ONE SIDE BY THE OWNERSHIP OF THE MOSTYN COLLIERIES A VALUELESS PROPERTY
LJ015-0032 AND ON THE OTHER BY BACKING UP
LJ015-0033 AN IMPECUNIOUS AND ROTTEN FIRM OF CONTRACTORS WITH VAST LIABILITIES AND PLEDGED TO IMPOSSIBLE WORKS ABROAD
LJ015-0034 THE ENGAGEMENTS OF THE BANK ON THESE TWO HEADS AMOUNTING TO NEARLY HALF A MILLION OF MONEY
LJ015-0035 PRODUCED IMMEDIATE EMBARRASSMENT AND FINANCIAL DISTRESS
LJ015-0036 THE BANK WAS ALREADY INSOLVENT
LJ015-0037 AND THE PARTNERS HAD TO DECIDE BETWEEN SUSPENDING PAYMENT OR CONTINUING TO HOLD ITS HEAD ABOVE WATER BY FLAGITIOUS PROCESSES
LJ015-0038 THEY CHOSE UNHAPPILY FOR THEMSELVES THE LATTER ALTERNATIVE
LJ015-0039 MONEY THEY MUST HAVE AND MONEY THEY RAISED TO MEET THEIR URGENT NECESSITIES UPON THE BALANCES AND SECURITIES DEPOSITED WITH THEM BY THEIR CUSTOMERS
LJ015-0040 THIS BORROWING CONTINUED AND ON SUCH A SCALE THAT THEIR PAPER WAS SOON AT A DISCOUNT
LJ015-0041 AND THE VARIOUS DISCOUNT HOUSES WOULD NOT ADVANCE SUFFICIENT SUMS TO RELIEVE THE NECESSITIES OF THE BANK
LJ015-0042 THEN IT WAS THAT INSTEAD OF MERELY PLEDGING SECURITIES THE BANK SOLD THEM OUTRIGHT AND THUS PASSED THE RUBICON OF FRAUD
LJ015-0043 THIS WENT ON FOR SOME TIME AND MIGHT NEVER HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED HAD SOME GOOD STROKE OF LUCK PROVIDED ANY OF THE PARTNERS
LJ015-0044 WITH MONEY ENOUGH TO RETRIEVE THE POSITION OF THE BANK BUT THAT PASSED FROM BAD TO WORSE
LJ015-0045 THE FIRM'S PAPER WENT DOWN FURTHER AND FURTHER IN VALUE AN APPLICATION TO THE COMMITTEE OF BANKERS FOR ASSISTANCE WAS PEREMPTORILY REFUSED
LJ015-0046 THEN CAME A RUN ON THE BANK AND IT WAS COMPELLED TO STOP PAYMENT
LJ015-0047 ITS DEBTS AMOUNTED TO THREEQUARTERS OF A MILLION AND THE DIVIDEND IT EVENTUALLY PAID WAS THREE AND TWOPENCE IN THE POUND
LJ015-0048 BUT WORSE THAN THE BANKRUPTCY WAS THE CONFESSION MADE BY THE PARTNERS IN THE COURT
LJ015-0049 THEY ADMITTED THAT THEY HAD MADE AWAY WITH MANY OF THE SECURITIES ENTRUSTED TO THEIR KEEPING
LJ015-0050 FOLLOWING THIS WARRANTS WERE ISSUED FOR THEIR ARREST
LJ015-0051 THE SPECIFIC CHARGE BEING THE UNLAWFUL NEGOTIATION OF DANISH BONDS AND OTHER SHARES BELONGING TO THE REV. DR. GRIFFITHS OF ROCHESTER
LJ015-0052 TO THE VALUE OF £20000
LJ015-0053 BATES WAS AT ONCE CAPTURED IN NORFOLK STREET STRAND
LJ015-0054 POLICE OFFICERS WENT DOWN AT NIGHT TO NUTFIELD NEAR REIGATE AND ARRESTED SIR JOHN PAUL BUT ALLOWED THE PRISONER TO SLEEP THERE
LJ015-0055 NEXT MORNING THEY ONLY JUST SAVED THE TRAIN TO TOWN AND LEFT SIR JOHN BEHIND ON THE PLATFORM BUT HE SUBSEQUENTLY SURRENDERED HIMSELF
LJ015-0056 MR. STRAHAN WAS ARRESTED AT A FRIEND'S HOUSE IN BRYANSTON SQUARE
LJ015-0057 ALL THREE WERE TRIED AT THE CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT AND SENTENCED TO FOURTEEN YEARS' TRANSPORTATION PASSING SOME TIME IN NEWGATE EN ROUTE
LJ015-0058 BATES THE LEAST GUILTY WAS PARDONED IN 1858
LJ015-0059 TWO CASES OF EXTENSIVE EMBEZZLEMENT WHICH WERE DISCOVERED ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY THOSE OF ROBSON AND REDPATH
LJ015-0060 WILL LONG BE REMEMBERED BOTH WITHIN AND WITHOUT THE COMMERCIAL WORLD
LJ015-0061 THEY BOTH REPRODUCED MANY OF THE FEATURES OF THE CASE OF WATTS ALREADY DESCRIBED
LJ015-0062 BUT IN NEITHER DID THE SUMS MISAPPROPRIATED REACH QUITE THE SAME HIGH FIGURE
LJ015-0063 BUT NEITHER ROBSON NOR REDPATH WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PURSUE THEIR FRAUDULENT DESIGNS WITH SUCCESS HAD THEY NOT LIKE WATTS
LJ015-0064 BEEN AFFORDED PECULIAR FACILITIES BY THE SLACKNESS OF SYSTEM AND THE WANT OF METHODICAL ADMINISTRATION IN THE CONCERNS BY WHICH THEY WERE EMPLOYED
LJ015-0065 ROBSON WAS OF HUMBLE ORIGIN BUT HE WAS WELL EDUCATED AND HE HAD SOME LITERARY ABILITIES
LJ015-0066 HIS PROCLIVITIES WERE THEATRICAL AND HE WAS THE AUTHOR OF SEVERAL PLAYS
LJ015-0067 ONE AT LEAST OF WHICH LOVE AND LOYALTY WITH WALLACK IN A LEADING PART ACHIEVED A CERTAIN SUCCESS
LJ015-0068 HE BEGAN LIFE AS A LAWWRITER EARNING THEREBY SOME FIFTEEN OR EIGHTEEN SHILLINGS A WEEK
LJ015-0069 BUT THE FIRM HE SERVED GOT HIM A SITUATION AS CLERK IN THE OFFICE OF THE GREAT NORTHERN RAILWAY
LJ015-0070 WHENCE HE PASSED TO A BETTER POSITION UNDER THE CRYSTAL PALACE COMPANY
LJ015-0071 HE NOW MARRIED ALTHOUGH HIS SALARY WAS ONLY A POUND A WEEK BUT HE SOON GOT ON
LJ015-0072 HE HAD A PLEASANT ADDRESS SHOWED GOOD BUSINESS APTITUDES AND QUICKLY ACQUIRED THE APPROVAL OF HIS SUPERIORS
LJ015-0073 WITHIN A YEAR HE WAS ADVANCED TO THE POST OF CHIEF CLERK IN THE TRANSFER DEPARTMENT AT A SALARY OF £150 A YEAR
LJ015-0074 HIS IMMEDIATE CHIEF WAS A MR. FASSON UPON WHOSE CONFIDENCE HE GAINED SO RAPIDLY THROUGH HIS ACTIVITY INDUSTRY AND ENGAGING MANNERS
LJ015-0075 THAT ERE LONG THE WHOLE MANAGEMENT OF THE TRANSFER DEPARTMENT WAS ENTRUSTED TO HIM
LJ015-0076 SOME TIME ELAPSED BEFORE ROBSON SUCCUMBED TO TEMPTATION
LJ015-0077 HE WAS NOT THE FIRST MAN OF LOOSE MORALITY AND EXPENSIVE TASTES
LJ015-0078 WHO PREFERRED TO RISK HIS FUTURE REPUTATION AND LIBERTY TO THE PRESENT DISCOMFORT OF LIVING UPON NARROW MEANS
LJ015-0079 THE TEMPTATION WAS ALL THE GREATER BECAUSE THE CHANCES OF SUCCESSFUL FRAUD LAY READY TO HAND
LJ015-0080 SHARES IN THE COMPANY WERE REPRESENTED BY CERTIFICATES WHICH OFTEN ENOUGH NEVER LEFT THE COMPANY'S OR MORE EXACTLY ROBSON'S HANDS
LJ015-0081 HE CONCEIVED THE IDEA OF TRANSFERRING SHARES BOGUS SHARES FROM A PERSON WHO HELD NONE TO ANY ONE WHO WOULD BUY THEM IN THE OPEN MARKET
LJ015-0082 HE TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT THE CERTIFICATES REPRESENTING THESE BOGUS SHARES AND WHICH PRACTICALLY DID NOT EXIST WOULD NEVER BE CALLED FOR
LJ015-0083 THIS INGENIOUS METHOD OF RAISING FUNDS HE ADOPTED AND CARRIED ON WITHOUT DETECTION
LJ015-0084 TILL THE DEFALCATIONS FROM FRAUDULENT TRANSFERS AND FRAUDULENT ISSUES COMBINED AMOUNTED TO £27000
LJ015-0085 WITH THE PROCEEDS OF THESE FLAGITIOUS FRAUDS ROBSON FEASTED AND MADE MERRY
LJ015-0086 HE KEPT OPEN HOUSE AT KILBURN PRIORY
LJ015-0087 ENTERTAINED LITERARY ARTISTIC AND DRAMATIC CELEBRITIES HAD A SMART TURN OUT ATTENDED ALL THE RACEMEETINGS AND DRESSED IN THE LATEST FASHION
LJ015-0088 TO HIS WIFE POOR SOUL HE MADE NO PRETENSE OF FIDELITY AND SHE ENJOYED ONLY SO MUCH OF HIS COMPANY AS WAS NECESSARILY SPENT
LJ015-0089 IN RECEIVING GUESTS AT HOME OR COULD BE SPARED FROM TWO RIVAL ESTABLISHMENTS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE TOWN
LJ015-0090 TO ACCOUNT FOR HIS REVENUES HE PRETENDED TO HAVE BEEN VERY LUCKY ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE WHICH WAS AT ONE TIME TRUE TO A LIMITED EXTENT
LJ015-0091 AND TO HAVE SUCCEEDED IN OTHER SPECULATIONS
LJ015-0092 WHEN HIS FRIENDS ASKED WHY HE A WEALTHY MAN OF INDEPENDENT MEANS CONTINUED TO SLAVE ON AS A CLERK ON A PITTANCE
LJ015-0093 HE REPLIED GAILY THAT HIS REGULAR WORK AT THE CRYSTAL PALACE OFFICE WAS USEFUL AS A SORT OF DISCIPLINE AND KEPT HIM STEADY
LJ015-0094 ALL THIS TIME HIS POSITION WAS ONE OF EXTREME INSECURITY HE WAS STANDING OVER A MINE WHICH AT ANY MOMENT MIGHT EXPLODE
LJ015-0095 THE BLOW FELL SUDDENLY AND WHEN LEAST EXPECTED ONE MORNING MR. FASSON ASKED CASUALLY FOR CERTAIN CERTIFICATES
LJ015-0096 WHETHER REPRESENTING REAL OR FICTITIOUS SHARES DOES NOT APPEAR BUT THEY WERE CERTIFICATES CONNECTED IN SOME WAY WITH ROBSON'S LONG PRACTICED FRAUDS
LJ015-0097 AND HE COULD NOT PRODUCE THEM HIS CHIEF ASKED STERNLY WHERE THEY WERE
LJ015-0098 ROBSON SAID THEY WERE AT KILBURN PRIORY
LJ015-0099 LET US GO TO KILBURN FOR THEM TOGETHER SAID MR. FASSON GROWING SUSPICIOUS
LJ015-0100 THEY DROVE THERE AND ROBSON ON ARRIVAL DID THE HONORS OF HIS HOUSE RANG FOR LUNCH TO GAIN TIME
LJ015-0101 BUT AT MR. FASSON'S PRESSING DEMANDS WENT UPSTAIRS TO FETCH THE CERTIFICATES
LJ015-0102 HE CAME BACK TO EXPLAIN THAT HE HAD MISLAID THEM
LJ015-0103 MR. FASSON MORE AND MORE ILL AT EASE WOULD NOT ACCEPT THIS SUBTERFUGE AND DECLARED THEY MUST BE FOUND
LJ015-0104 ROBSON AGAIN LEFT HIM BUT ONLY TO GATHER TOGETHER HASTILY ALL THE MONEY AND VALUABLES ON WHICH HE COULD LAY HIS HANDS WITH WHICH HE LEFT THE HOUSE
LJ015-0105 MR. FASSON WAITED AND WAITED FOR HIS SUBORDINATE TO REAPPEAR AND AT LAST DISCOVERED HIS FLIGHT
LJ015-0106 A REWARD WAS FORTHWITH OFFERED FOR ROBSON'S APPREHENSION
LJ015-0107 MEANWHILE THE ABSCONDING CLERK HAD COOLLY DRIVEN TO A FAVORITE DININGPLACE IN THE WEST END
LJ015-0108 WHERE A FISH CURRY AND A BRACE OF PARTRIDGES WERE SET BEFORE HIM
LJ015-0109 AND HE DISCUSSED THE LATTER WITH APPETITE BUT BEGGED THAT THEY WOULD NEVER GIVE HIM CURRY AGAIN AS HE DID NOT LIKE IT
LJ015-0110 AFTER DINNER HE WENT INTO HIDING FOR A DAY OR TWO
LJ015-0111 THEN ACCOMPANIED BY A LADY NOT MRS. ROBSON HE TOOK STEAMER AND STARTED FOR COPENHAGEN
LJ015-0112 BUT THE CONTINENTAL POLICE HAD BEEN WARNED TO LOOK OUT FOR HIM AND TWO DANISH INSPECTORS GOT UPON HIS TRACK
LJ015-0113 FOLLOWED HIM OVER TO SWEDEN AND ARRESTED HIM AT HELSINGFORS
LJ015-0114 THENCE HE WAS TRANSFERRED TO COPENHAGEN AND SURRENDERED IN DUE COURSE TO A LONDON POLICE OFFICER
LJ015-0115 LITTLE MORE REMAINS TO BE SAID ABOUT ROBSON. HE APPEARS TO HAVE ACCEPTED HIS POSITION AND TO HAVE AT ONCE RESIGNED HIMSELF TO HIS FATE
LJ015-0116 WHEN BROUGHT TO TRIAL HE TOOK MATTERS VERY COOLLY AND AT FIRST PLEADED NOT GUILTY BUT SUBSEQUENTLY WITHDREW THE PLEA
LJ015-0117 SERGEANT BALLANTINE WHO PROSECUTED
LJ015-0118 PAID HIM THE COMPLIMENT OF DESCRIBING HIM AS A YOUNG MAN OF GREAT INTELLIGENCE CONSIDERABLE POWERS OF MIND
LJ015-0119 AND POSSESSED OF AN EDUCATION VERY MUCH BEYOND THE RANK OF LIFE TO WHICH HE ORIGINALLY BELONGED
LJ015-0120 ROBSON WAS FOUND GUILTY AND SENTENCED TO TWO TERMS OF TRANSPORTATION ONE FOR TWENTY AND ONE FOR FOURTEEN YEARS
LJ015-0121 NEWGATE OFFICERS WHO REMEMBER ROBSON STILL DESCRIBE HIM AS A FINE YOUNG MAN WHO BEHAVED WELL AS A PRISONER
LJ015-0122 BUT WHO HAD ALL THE APPEARANCE OF A CARELESS THOUGHTLESS HAPPYGOLUCKY FELLOW
LJ015-0123 IN MANY RESPECTS THE EMBEZZLEMENT OF WHICH LEOPOLD REDPATH WAS GUILTY CLOSELY RESEMBLED THAT OF ROBSON
LJ015-0124 BUT IT WAS BASED UPON MORE EXTENDED AND AUDACIOUS FORGERIES
LJ015-0125 REDPATH'S CRIME AROSE FROM HIS PECULIAR AND INDEPENDENT POSITION AS REGISTRAR OF STOCK OF THE GREAT NORTHERN RAILWAY COMPANY
LJ015-0126 THIS OFFERED HIM GREAT FACILITIES FOR THE CREATION OF ARTIFICIAL STOCK ITS SALE FROM A FICTITIOUS HOLDER AND TRANSFER TO HIMSELF
LJ015-0127 ALL THE SIGNATURES IN THE TRANSFER WERE FORGED. NOT ONLY DID HE THUS TRANSFER AND REALIZE BOGUS STOCK
LJ015-0128 BUT HE BOUGHT BONA FIDE AMOUNTS AND INCREASED THEIR VALUE BY ALTERING THE FIGURES
LJ015-0129 BY INSERTING SAY 1 BEFORE 500 AND THUS MAKING IT
LJ015-0130 FIFTEEN HUNDRED POUNDS WHICH LARGER AMOUNT WAS DULY CARRIED TO HIS CREDIT ON THE REGISTER AND ENTERED UPON THE CERTIFICATES OF TRANSFER
LJ015-0131 BY THESE MEANS REDPATH MISAPPROPRIATED VAST SUMS DURING A PERIOD EXTENDING OVER TEN YEARS
LJ015-0132 THE TOTAL AMOUNT WAS NEVER EXACTLY MADE OUT BUT THE FALSE STOCK CREATED AND ISSUED BY HIM WAS ESTIMATED AT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS
LJ015-0133 EVEN WHEN THE BUBBLE BURST REDPATH WHO HAD LIVED AT THE RATE OF TWENTY THOUSAND A YEAR
LJ015-0134 HAD ASSETS IN THE SHAPE OF LAND HOUSE FURNITURE PICTURES AND OBJETS D'ART TO THE VALUE OF £50000
LJ015-0135 HE BEGAN IN A VERY SMALL WAY
LJ015-0136 FIRST A LAWYER'S CLERK HE THEN GOT AN APPOINTMENT IN THE PENINSULAR AND ORIENTAL COMPANY'S OFFICE
LJ015-0137 AFTERWARDS HE SET UP AS AN INSURANCE BROKER ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT BUT PRESENTLY FAILED
LJ015-0138 HIS FAULT WAS GENEROSITY
LJ015-0139 AN OPENHANDED UNTHINKING CHARITY WHICH GAVE FREELY TO THE POOR AND NEEDY THE MONEY WHICH BELONGED TO HIS CREDITORS
LJ015-0140 AFTER HIS BANKRUPTCY HE OBTAINED A PLACE AS CLERK IN THE GREAT NORTHERN RAILWAY OFFICE
LJ015-0141 FROM WHICH HE ROSE TO BE ASSISTANT REGISTRAR WITH THE SPECIAL DUTIES OF TRANSFERRING SHARES
LJ015-0142 HE SOON PROVED HIS ABILITY AND BY UNREMITTING ATTENTION MASTERED THE WHOLE WORK OF THE OFFICE
LJ015-0143 LATER ON HE BECAME REGISTRAR AND IN THIS MORE INDEPENDENT POSITION
LJ015-0144 DEVELOPED TO A COLOSSAL EXTENT THE FRAUDS HE HAD ALREADY PRACTICED AS A SUBORDINATE
LJ015-0145 NOW HE LAUNCHED OUT INTO GREAT EXPENDITURE TOOK A HOUSE IN CHESTER TERRACE AND BECAME KNOWN AS A MAECENAS AND PATRON OF THE ARTS
LJ015-0146 HE HAD A NICE TASTE IN BRICÀBRAC AND WAS CONSIDERED A GOOD JUDGE OF PICTURES
LJ015-0147 LEADING SOCIAL AND ARTISTIC PERSONAGES WERE TO BE MET WITH AT HIS HOUSE AND HIS HOSPITALITY WAS FAR FAMED
LJ015-0148 THE CHOICEST WINES THE FINEST FRUITS
LJ015-0149 PEAS AT TEN SHILLINGS A QUART FIVEGUINEA PINES AND EARLY ASPARAGUS WERE TO BE FOUND ON HIS TABLE
LJ015-0150 BUT HIS CHIEF EXTRAVAGANCE HIS FAVORITE FOLLY WAS THE EXERCISE OF AN OSTENTATIOUS BENEVOLENCE
LJ015-0151 THE PHILANTHROPY HE HAD DISPLAYED IN A SMALL WAY WHEN LESS PROSPEROUS BECAME NOW A PASSION
LJ015-0152 HIS NAME HEADED EVERY SUBSCRIPTION LIST HIS PURSE WAS ALWAYS OPEN
LJ015-0153 NOT CONTENT WITH GIVING WHERE ASSISTANCE WAS SOLICITED HE HIMSELF SOUGHT OUT DESERVING CASES AND PERSONALLY AFFORDED RELIEF
LJ015-0154 WHEN THE CRASH CAME THERE WERE PENSIONERS AND OTHER RECIPIENTS OF HIS BOUNTY WHO COULD NOT BELIEVE
LJ015-0155 THAT SO GOOD A MAN HAD REALLY BEEN FOR YEARS A SWINDLER AND A ROGUE
LJ015-0156 DOWN AT WEYBRIDGE WHERE HE HAD A COUNTRY PLACE HIS NAME WAS LONG REMEMBERED WITH GRATITUDE BY THE POOR
LJ015-0157 DURING THE DAYS OF HIS PROSPERITY HE WAS A GOVERNOR OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL
LJ015-0158 OF THE ST. ANN'S SOCIETY AND ONE OF THE SUPPORTERS AND MANAGERS OF THE PATRIOTIC FUND
LJ015-0159 IN HIS PERSON HE WAS NEAT AND FASTIDIOUS
LJ015-0160 HE PATRONIZED THE BEST TAILORS AND HAD A FASHIONABLE COIFFEUR FROM HANOVER SQUARE DAILY TO CURL HIS HAIR
LJ015-0161 THERE WAS SOMETHING DRAMATIC IN REDPATH'S DETECTION
LJ015-0162 JUST AFTER ROBSON'S FRAUDS HAD AGITATED THE MINDS OF ALL DIRECTORS OF COMPANIES THE CHAIRMAN OF THE GREAT NORTHERN MR. DENISON
LJ015-0163 WAS STANDING AT A RAILWAY STATION TALKING TO A CERTAIN WELLKNOWN PEER OF THE REALM
LJ015-0164 REDPATH PASSED AND LIFTED HIS HAT TO HIS CHAIRMAN THE LATTER ACKNOWLEDGED THE SALUTE
LJ015-0165 BUT THE PEER RUSHED FORWARD AND SHOOK REDPATH WARMLY BY THE HAND
LJ015-0166 WHAT DO YOU KNOW OF OUR CLERK ASKED MR. DENISON OF HIS LORDSHIP. ONLY THAT HE IS A CAPITAL FELLOW WHO GIVES THE BEST DINNERS AND BALLS IN TOWN
LJ015-0167 REDPATH HAD INDUSTRIOUSLY CIRCULATED REPORTS THAT HE HAD PROSPERED GREATLY IN SPECULATION
LJ015-0168 BUT THE CHAIRMAN OF THE GREAT NORTHERN COULD NOT REALIZE THAT A CLERK OF THE COMPANY COULD HONESTLY BE IN THE POSSESSION OF UNLIMITED WEALTH
LJ015-0169 IT WAS AT ONCE DECIDED AT THE BOARD TO MAKE A THOROUGH EXAMINATION OF ALL HIS BOOKS
LJ015-0170 REDPATH WAS CALLED IN AND INFORMED OF THE INTENDED INVESTIGATION. HE TRIED TO STAVE OFF THE EVIL HOUR BY DECLARING THAT EVERYTHING WAS PERFECTLY RIGHT
LJ015-0171 BUT FINDING HE COULD NOT ESCAPE HE SAID HE WOULD RESIGN HIS POST AND LEAVING THE BOARDROOM DISAPPEARED
LJ015-0172 THE INQUIRY SOON REVEALED THE COLOSSAL CHARACTER OF THE FRAUDS
LJ015-0173 WARRANTS WERE ISSUED FOR REDPATH'S ARREST BUT HE HAD FLOWN TO PARIS
LJ015-0174 THITHER POLICE OFFICERS FOLLOWED ONLY TO FIND THAT HE HAD RETURNED TO LONDON
LJ015-0175 A FURTHER SEARCH DISCOVERED HIM AT BREAKFAST AT A SMALL HOUSE IN THE NEW ROAD
LJ015-0176 HE WAS ARRESTED EXAMINED BEFORE A POLICE MAGISTRATE AND COMMITTED TO NEWGATE
LJ015-0177 GREAT EXCITEMENT PREVAILED IN THE CITY AND THE WEST END WHEN REDPATH'S DEFALCATIONS WERE MADE PUBLIC
LJ015-0178 THE STOCK MARKET WAS GREATLY AFFECTED AND SOCIETY MORE ESPECIALLY THAT WHICH FREQUENTS EXETER HALL WAS CONVULSED
LJ015-0179 THE CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT WHEN THE TRIAL CAME ON
LJ015-0180 WAS DENSELY CROWDED AND MANY CURIOUS EYES WERE TURNED UPON THE SOMEWHAT REMARKABLE MAN WHO OCCUPIED THE DOCK
LJ015-0181 HE IS DESCRIBED BY A CONTEMPORARY ACCOUNT AS A FRESHLOOKING MAN OF FORTY YEARS OF AGE SLIGHTLY BALD INCLINED TO EMBONPOINT
LJ015-0182 AND THOROUGHLY EMBODYING THE IDEA OF ENGLISH RESPECTABILITY
LJ015-0183 HIS MANNER WAS GENERALLY SELFPOSSESSED BUT HIS FACE WAS MARKED WITH UNEASY EARNESTNESS
LJ015-0184 AND HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM WITH WAYWARD FURTIVE GLANCES
LJ015-0185 WHEN THE JURY FOUND A VERDICT OF GUILTY HE REMAINED UNMOVED. HE LISTENED WITHOUT EMOTION TO THE JUDGE'S WELLMERITED CENSURES
LJ015-0186 AND RECEIVED HIS SENTENCE OF TRANSPORTATION FOR LIFE WITHOUT MUCH SURPRISE
LJ015-0187 REDPATH PASSED AWAY INTO THE OUTER DARKNESS OF A PENAL COLONY WHERE HE WAS STILL LIVING A YEAR OR TWO BACK
LJ015-0188 BUT HIS NAME LINGERS STILL IN THIS COUNTRY AS THAT OF THE FIRST SWINDLER OF HIS TIME
LJ015-0189 AND THE PROTOTYPE OF A CLASS NOT UNCOMMON IN OUR LATER DAYS
LJ015-0190 THAT OF DISHONEST ROGUES WHO ASSUME PIETY AND PHILANTHROPY AS A CLOAK FOR THEIR MISDEEDS
LJ015-0191 IN NEWGATE REDPATH IS REMEMBERED BY THE PRISON OFFICER AS A DIFFICULT MAN TO DEAL WITH
LJ015-0192 FROM THE MOMENT OF HIS RECEPTION HE GAVE HIMSELF GREAT AIRS AS A MARTYR AND A MAN HEAVILY WRONGED
LJ015-0193 BYANDBY WHEN ESCAPE SEEMED HOPELESS AND AFTER SENTENCE HE SUDDENLY DEGENERATED INTO THE LOWEST STAMP OF CRIMINAL
LJ015-0194 AND BEHAVED SO AS TO JUSTIFY A BELIEF THAT HE HAD BEEN A JAILBIRD ALL HIS LIFE
LJ015-0195 IT HAS BEEN ALREADY REMARKED IN THESE PAGES THAT WITH CHANGED SOCIAL CONDITIONS CAME A GREAT CHANGE IN THE CHARACTER OF CRIMES
LJ015-0196 HIGHWAY ROBBERIES FOR INSTANCE HAD DISAPPEARED IF WE EXCEPT THE SPASMODIC AND SEVERELY REPRESSED OUTBREAK OF GAROTTING
LJ015-0197 WHICH AT ONE TIME SPREAD TERROR THROUGHOUT LONDON. THIEVES PREFERRED NOW TO USE INGENUITY RATHER THAN BRUTE FORCE
LJ015-0198 IT WAS NO LONGER POSSIBLE TO STOP A COACH OR CARRIAGE OR ROB THE POSTMAN WHO CARRIED THE MAIL
LJ015-0199 THE IMPROVED METHODS OF LOCOMOTION HAD PUT A STOP TO THESE DEPREDATIONS. PEOPLE TRAVELED IN COMPANY AS A RULE
LJ015-0200 ONLY WHEN SINGLE AND UNPROTECTED WERE THEY IN ANY DANGER OF ATTACK AND THAT BUT RARELY
LJ015-0201 THERE WERE STILL BIG PRIZES HOWEVER TO TEMPT THE DARING AND NONE APPEALED MORE TO THE THIEVISH INSTINCT THAN THE CUSTOM OF TRANSMITTING GOLD BY RAIL
LJ015-0202 THE PRECIOUS METAL WAS SENT FROM PLACE TO PLACE CAREFULLY LOCKED UP AND GUARDED NO DOUBT
LJ015-0203 BUT WERE THE PRECAUTIONS TOO MINUTE THE VIGILANCE TOO CLOSE TO BE ELUDED OR OVERCOME
LJ015-0204 THIS WAS THE QUESTION WHICH PRESENTED ITSELF TO THE FERTILE BRAIN OF ONE PIERCE
LJ015-0205 WHO HAD BEEN CONCERNED IN VARIOUS JOBS OF A DISHONEST CHARACTER AND WHO FOR THE MOMENT WAS A CLERK IN A BETTING OFFICE
LJ015-0206 HE LAID THE SUGGESTION BEFORE AGAR A PROFESSIONAL THIEF WHO WAS OF OPINION IT CONTAINED ELEMENTS OF SUCCESS
LJ015-0207 BUT THE COLLUSION AND ACTIVE ASSISTANCE OF EMPLOYEES OF THE RAILWAY CARRIERS WERE INDISPENSABLE AND TOGETHER
LJ015-0208 THEY SOUNDED ONE BURGESS A GUARD ON THE SOUTHEASTERN RAILWAY A LINE BY WHICH LARGE QUANTITIES OF BULLION WERE SENT TO THE CONTINENT
LJ015-0209 BURGESS DETAILED THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF TRANSMISSION
LJ015-0210 THE GOLD PACKED IN AN IRONBOUND BOX WAS SECURELY LODGED IN SAFES LOCKED WITH PATENT CHUBBS
LJ015-0211 EACH SAFE HAD THREE SETS OF DOUBLE KEYS ALL HELD BY CONFIDENTIAL SERVANTS OF THE COMPANY
LJ015-0212 ONE PAIR WAS WITH THE TRAFFIC SUPERINTENDENT IN LONDON ANOTHER WITH AN OFFICIAL IN FOLKESTONE
LJ015-0213 A THIRD WITH THE CAPTAIN OF THE FOLKESTONE AND BOULOGNE BOAT
LJ015-0214 AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHANNEL THE FRENCH RAILWAY AUTHORITIES TOOK CHARGE
LJ015-0215 THE SAFES WHILE ON THE LINE EN ROUTE BETWEEN LONDON AND FOLKESTONE WERE IN THE GUARD'S VAN
LJ015-0216 THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT STEP AND THEY MIGHT EASILY BE ROBBED SOME DAY WHEN BURGESS WAS THE GUARD PROVIDED ONLY THAT THEY COULD BE OPENED
LJ015-0217 THE NEXT STEP WAS TO GET IMPRESSIONS AND FABRICATE FALSE KEYS
LJ015-0218 A NEW ACCOMPLICE WAS NOW NEEDED WITHIN THE COMPANY'S ESTABLISHMENT AND PIERCE LOOKED ABOUT LONG BEFORE HE FOUND THE RIGHT PERSON
LJ015-0219 AT LAST HE DECIDED TO ENLIST ONE TESTER A CLERK IN THE TRAFFIC DEPARTMENT WHOM HE THOUGHT WOULD PROVE A LIKELY TOOL
LJ015-0220 THE FOUR WAITED PATIENTLY FOR THEIR OPPORTUNITY
LJ015-0221 WHICH CAME WHEN THE SAFES WERE SENT TO CHUBBS' TO BE REPAIRED AND CHUBBS SENT THEM BACK BUT ONLY WITH ONE KEY
LJ015-0222 IN SUCH A WAY THAT TESTER HAD POSSESSION OF THIS KEY FOR A TIME
LJ015-0223 HE LENT IT TO AGAR FOR A BRIEF SPACE WHO PROMPTLY TOOK AN IMPRESSION ON WAX. BUT THE SAFES HAD A DOUBLE LOCK
LJ015-0224 THE DIFFICULTY WAS TO GET A COPY OF THE SECOND KEY
LJ015-0225 THIS WAS AT LENGTH EFFECTED BY AGAR AND PIERCE
LJ015-0226 AFTER HANGING ABOUT THE FOLKESTONE OFFICE FOR SOME TIME THEY SAW AT LAST THAT THE KEY WAS KEPT IN A CERTAIN CUPBOARD
LJ015-0227 STILL WATCHING AND WAITING FOR THE FIRST CHANCE THEY SEIZED IT WHEN THE CLERKS LEFT THE OFFICE EMPTY FOR A MOMENT
LJ015-0228 PIERCE BOLDLY STEPPED IN FOUND THE CUPBOARD UNLOCKED HE REMOVED THE KEY HANDED IT TO AGAR OUTSIDE
LJ015-0229 WHO QUICKLY TOOK THE WAX IMPRESSION HANDED IT BACK TO PIERCE PIERCE REPLACED IT LEFT THE OFFICE AND THE THING WAS DONE
LJ015-0230 AFTER THIS NOTHING REMAINED BUT TO WAIT FOR SOME OCCASION WHEN THE AMOUNT TRANSMITTED WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO JUSTIFY THE RISKS OF ROBBERY
LJ015-0231 IT WAS TESTER'S BUSINESS WHO HAD ACCESS TO THE RAILWAY COMPANY'S BOOKS TO WATCH FOR THIS
LJ015-0232 MEANWHILE THE OTHERS COMPLETED THEIR PREPARATIONS WITH THE UTMOST CARE
LJ015-0233 A WEIGHT OF SHOT WAS BOUGHT AND STOWED IN CARPET BAGS READY TO REPLACE EXACTLY THE ABSTRACTED GOLD
LJ015-0234 COURIER BAGS WERE BOUGHT TO CARRY THE STUFF SLUNG OVER THE SHOULDERS
LJ015-0235 AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST AGAR FREQUENTLY TRAVELED UP AND DOWN THE LINE TO TEST THE FALSE KEYS HE HAD MANUFACTURED WITH PIERCE'S ASSISTANCE
LJ015-0236 BURGESS ADMITTED HIM INTO THE GUARD'S VAN WHERE HE FITTED AND FILED THE KEYS TILL THEY WORKED EASILY AND SATISFACTORILY IN THE LOCKS OF THE SAFE
LJ015-0237 ONE NIGHT TESTER WHISPERED TO AGAR AND PIERCE ALL RIGHT AS THEY CAUTIOUSLY LOUNGED ABOUT LONDON BRIDGE
LJ015-0238 THE THIEVES TOOK FIRSTCLASS TICKETS HANDED THEIR BAGS FULL OF SHOT TO THE PORTERS WHO PLACED THEM IN THE GUARD'S VAN
LJ015-0239 JUST AS THE TRAIN WAS STARTING AGAR SLIPPED INTO THE VAN WITH BURGESS AND PIERCE GOT INTO A FIRSTCLASS CARRIAGE
LJ015-0240 AGAR AT ONCE GOT TO WORK ON THE FIRST SAFE
LJ015-0241 OPENED IT TOOK OUT AND BROKE INTO THE BULLION BOX REMOVED THE GOLD SUBSTITUTED THE SHOT FROM A CARPET BAG
LJ015-0242 REFASTENED AND RESEALED THE BULLION BOX AND REPLACED IT IN THE SAFE
LJ015-0243 AT REDHILL TESTER MET THE TRAIN AND RELIEVED THE THIEVES OF A PORTION OF THE STOLEN GOLD
LJ015-0244 AT THE SAME STATION PIERCE JOINED AGAR IN THE GUARD'S VAN AND THERE WERE NOW THREE TO CARRY ON THE ROBBERY
LJ015-0245 THE TWO REMAINING SAFES WERE ATTACKED AND NEARLY ENTIRELY DESPOILED IN THE SAME WAY AS THE FIRST AND THE CONTENTS TRANSFERRED TO THE COURIER BAGS
LJ015-0246 THE TRAIN WAS NOW APPROACHING FOLKESTONE AND AGAR AND PIERCE HID THEMSELVES IN A DARK PART OF THE VAN
LJ015-0247 AT THAT STATION THE SAFES WERE GIVEN OUT HEAVY WITH SHOT NOT GOLD THE THIEVES WENT ON TO DOVER AND BYANDBY
LJ015-0248 WITH OSTEND TICKETS PREVIOUSLY PROCURED RETURNED TO LONDON WITHOUT MISHAP AND BY DEGREES DISPOSED OF MUCH OF THE STOLEN GOLD
LJ015-0249 THE THEFT WAS DISCOVERED AT BOULOGNE WHEN THE BOXES WERE FOUND NOT TO WEIGH EXACTLY WHAT THEY OUGHT. BUT NO CLUE WAS OBTAINED TO THE THIEVES
LJ015-0250 AND THE THEFT MIGHT HAVE REMAINED A MYSTERY BUT FOR THE SUBSEQUENT BAD FAITH OF PIERCE TO HIS ACCOMPLICE AGAR
LJ015-0251 THE LATTER WAS ERE LONG ARRESTED ON A CHARGE OF UTTERING FORGED CHEQUES CONVICTED AND SENTENCED TO TRANSPORTATION FOR LIFE
LJ015-0252 WHEN HE KNEW THAT HE COULD NOT ESCAPE HIS FATE
LJ015-0253 HE HANDED OVER TO PIERCE A SUM OF £3000 HIS OWN WHETHER RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY ACQUIRED NEVER CAME OUT
LJ015-0254 TOGETHER WITH THE UNREALIZED PART OF THE BULLION AMOUNTING IN ALL TO SOME £15000
LJ015-0255 AND BEGGED HIS ACCOMPLICE TO INVEST IT AS A SETTLEMENT ON A WOMAN NAMED KAY BY WHOM HE HAD HAD A CHILD
LJ015-0256 PIERCE MADE KAY ONLY A FEW SMALL PAYMENTS THEN APPROPRIATED THE REST OF THE MONEY
LJ015-0257 KAY WHO HAD BEEN LIVING WITH AGAR AT THE TIME OF THE BULLION ROBBERY
LJ015-0258 WENT TO THE POLICE IN GREAT FURY AND DISTRESS AND DISCLOSED ALL SHE KNEW OF THE AFFAIR
LJ015-0259 AGAR TOO IN NEWGATE HEARD HOW PIERCE HAD TREATED HIM AND AT ONCE READILY TURNED APPROVER
LJ015-0260 AS THE EVIDENCE HE GAVE INCRIMINATED PIERCE BURGESS AND TESTER ALL THREE WERE ARRESTED AND COMMITTED TO NEWGATE FOR TRIAL
LJ015-0261 THE WHOLE STRANGE STORY THE LONG INCUBATION AND THE ELABORATE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE PLOT
LJ015-0262 CAME OUT AT THE OLD BAILEY AND WAS ACKNOWLEDGED TO BE ONE OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY ON RECORD
LJ015-0263 SCARCELY HAD THE CONVICTION OF THESE DARING AND ASTUTE THIEVES BEEN ASSURED THAN ANOTHER GIGANTIC FRAUD WAS BROUGHT TO LIGHT
LJ015-0264 THE SERIES OF BOLDLYCONCEIVED AND CLEVERLYEXECUTED FORGERIES IN WHICH JAMES TOWNSHEND SAWARD COMMONLY CALLED JEM THE PENMAN
LJ015-0265 WAS THE PRIME MOVER
LJ015-0266 HAS PROBABLY NO PARALLEL IN THE ANNALS OF CRIME. SAWARD HIMSELF IS A STRIKING AND IN SOME RESPECTS AN UNIQUE FIGURE IN CRIMINAL HISTORY
LJ015-0267 A MAN OF BIRTH AND EDUCATION A MEMBER OF THE BAR AND OF ACKNOWLEDGED LEGAL ATTAINMENTS HIS PROCLIVITIES WERE ALL DOWNWARD
LJ015-0268 INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING AN HONORABLE PROFESSION HE PREFERRED TO TURN HIS GREAT NATURAL TALENTS AND READY WITS TO THE MOST NEFARIOUS PRACTICES
LJ015-0269 HE WAS KNOWN TO THE WHOLE CRIMINAL FRATERNITY AS A HIGHCLASS RECEIVER OF STOLEN GOODS A NEGOTIATOR MORE ESPECIALLY OF STOLEN PAPER
LJ015-0270 CHEQUES AND BILLS OF WHICH HE MADE A PARTICULAR USE
LJ015-0271 HE DEALT TOO IN THE PRECIOUS METALS WHEN THEY HAD BEEN IMPROPERLY ACQUIRED
LJ015-0272 AND IT WAS TO HIM THAT AGAR PIERCE AND THE REST APPLIED WHEN SEEKING TO DISPOSE OF THEIR STOLEN BULLION
LJ015-0273 BUT SAWARD'S OPERATIONS WERE MAINLY DIRECTED TO THE FABRICATION AND UTTERING OF FORGED CHEQUES
LJ015-0274 HIS METHOD WAS COMPREHENSIVE AND DEEPLY LAID
LJ015-0275 BURGLARS BROUGHT HIM THE CHEQUES THEY STOLE FROM HOUSES THIEVES WHAT THEY GOT IN POCKETBOOKS
LJ015-0276 CHEQUES BLANK AND CANCELED WERE HIS STOCKINTRADE. THE FORMER HE FILLED UP BY EXACT IMITATION OF THE LATTER SIGNATURE AND ALL
LJ015-0277 WHEN HE COULD GET NOTHING BUT THE BLANK CHEQUE HE SET IN MOTION ALL SORTS OF SCHEMES FOR OBTAINING SIGNATURES SUCH AS
LJ015-0278 COMMENCING SHAM ACTIONS AND ADDRESSING FORMAL APPLICATIONS MERELY FOR THE REPLY
LJ015-0279 ONE STROKE OF LUCK WHICH HE TURNED TO GREAT ACCOUNT
LJ015-0280 WAS THE RETURN FROM TRANSPORTATION OF AN OLD PAL AND CONFEDERATE WHO BROUGHT WITH HIM SOME BILLS OF EXCHANGE
LJ015-0281 SAWARD'S METHOD OF NEGOTIATING THE CHEQUES WAS EQUALLY WELL PLANNED
LJ015-0282 LIKE HIS GREAT PREDECESSOR OLD PATCH HE NEVER WENT TO A BANK HIMSELF NOR DID ANY OF HIS ACCOMPLICES
LJ015-0283 THE BEARER OF THE CHEQUE WAS ALWAYS INNOCENT AND IGNORANT OF THE FRAUDULENT NATURE OF THE DOCUMENT HE PRESENTED
LJ015-0284 IN ORDER TO OBTAIN MESSENGERS OF THIS SORT SAWARD ANSWERED ADVERTISEMENTS OF PERSONS SEEKING EMPLOYMENT
LJ015-0285 AND WHEN THESE PRESENTED THEMSELVES ENTRUSTED THEM AS A BEGINNING WITH THE DUTY OF CASHING CHEQUES
LJ015-0286 A CONFEDERATE FOLLOWED THE EMISSARY CLOSELY
LJ015-0287 NOT ONLY TO ENSURE FAIR PLAY AND THE SURRENDER OF THE PROCEEDS IF THE CHEQUE WAS CASHED BUT TO GIVE TIMELY NOTICE IF IT WAS NOT
LJ015-0288 SO THAT SAWARD AND THE REST MIGHT MAKE THEMSELVES SCARCE
LJ015-0289 AS EACH TRANSACTION WAS CARRIED OUT FROM A DIFFERENT ADDRESS AND A DIFFERENT MESSENGER ALWAYS EMPLOYED
LJ015-0290 THE FORGERS ALWAYS ESCAPED DETECTION. BUT FATE OVERTOOK TWO OF THE GANG
LJ015-0291 PARTLY THROUGH THEIR OWN CARELESSNESS WHEN TRANSFERRING THEIR OPERATIONS TO YARMOUTH
LJ015-0292 ONE NAMED HARDWICKE ASSUMED THE NAME OF RALPH AND TO OBTAIN COMMERCIAL CREDIT IN YARMOUTH PAID IN £250 TO A YARMOUTH BANK
LJ015-0293 AS COMING FROM A MR. WHITNEY
LJ015-0294 HE FORGOT TO ADD THAT IT WAS TO BE PLACED TO RALPH'S CREDIT AND WHEN HE CALLED AS RALPH
LJ015-0295 HE WAS TOLD IT WAS ONLY AT MR. WHITNEY'S DISPOSAL AND THAT IT COULD BE PAID TO NO ONE ELSE
LJ015-0296 HARDWICKE OR RALPH APPEALED TO SAWARD IN HIS DIFFICULTY
LJ015-0297 AND THAT CLEVER SCHEMER SENT AN ELABORATE LETTER OF INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO ASK FOR THE MONEY
LJ015-0298 BUT WHILE HARDWICKE WAS IN COMMUNICATION WITH SAWARD THE BANK WAS IN COMMUNICATION WITH LONDON
LJ015-0299 AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE DEEMED SUFFICIENTLY SUSPICIOUS TO WARRANT THE ARREST OF THE GENTLEMEN AT YARMOUTH ON A CHARGE OF FORGERY AND CONSPIRACY
LJ015-0300 SAWARD'S LETTER TO HARDWICKE FELL INTO THE HANDS OF THE POLICE AND COMPROMISED HIM
LJ015-0301 WHILE HARDWICKE AND ATWELL WERE IN NEWGATE AWAITING TRIAL ACTIVE SEARCH WAS MADE FOR SAWARD
LJ015-0302 WHO WAS AT LENGTH TAKEN IN A COFFEESHOP NEAR OXFORD STREET UNDER THE NAME OF HOPKINS HE RESISTED AT FIRST AND DENIED HIS IDENTITY
LJ015-0303 BUT ON BEING SEARCHED TWO BLANK CHEQUES OF THE LONDON AND WESTMINSTER BANK WERE FOUND IN HIS POCKET
LJ015-0304 HE THEN CONFESSED THAT HE WAS THE REDOUBTABLE JEM SAWARD OR JEM THE PENMAN AND WAS CONVEYED TO A POLICECOURT AND THENCE TO NEWGATE
LJ015-0305 AT HIS TRIAL ATWELL AND HARDWICKE TWO OF HIS CHIEF ALLIES AND ACCOMPLICES TURNED APPROVERS
LJ015-0306 AND THE WHOLE SCHEME OF SYSTEMATIC FORGERY WAS LAID BARE
LJ015-0307 THE EVIDENCE WAS CORROBORATED BY THAT OF MANY OF THE VICTIMS WHO HAD ACTED AS MESSENGERS
LJ015-0308 AND OTHERS WHO SWORE TO THE MEETINGS OF THE CONSPIRATORS AND THEIR MOVEMENTS. SAWARD WAS FOUND GUILTY
LJ015-0309 AND THE JUDGE IN PASSING SENTENCE ON HIM OF TRANSPORTATION FOR LIFE EXPRESSED DEEP REGRET THAT THE INGENUITY SKILL AND TALENT
LJ015-0310 WHICH HAD RECEIVED SO PERVERTED AND MISTAKEN DIRECTION
LJ015-0311 HAD NOT BEEN GUIDED BY A SENSE OF VIRTUE AND DIRECTED TO MORE HONORABLE AND USEFUL PURSUITS
LJ015-0312 THE PROCEEDS OF THESE FORGERIES AMOUNTED IT WAS SAID TO SOME THOUSANDS PER ANNUM
LJ015-0313 SAWARD SPENT ALL HIS SHARE AT LOW GAMING HOUSES AND IN ALL MANNER OF DEBAUCHERIES
LJ015-0314 HE WAS IN PERSON A SHORT SQUAREBUILT MAN OF GENTLEMANLY ADDRESS SHARP AND SHREWD IN CONVERSATION AND MANNER
LJ016-0001 THE CHRONICLES OF NEWGATE VOLUME 2. BY ARTHUR GRIFFITHS. SECTION 19 LATER RECORDS
LJ016-0002 THE OLD NOTION ALWAYS PREVAILED THAT NEWGATE WAS IMPREGNABLE SO TO SPEAK FROM WITHIN
LJ016-0003 AND THAT NONE OF ITS INMATES COULD HOPE TO ESCAPE FROM ITS SECURE PRECINCTS
LJ016-0004 YET THE JAIL IN SPITE OF ITS FORTRESSLIKE ASPECT WAS BY NO MEANS REALLY SAFE
LJ016-0005 YEAR AFTER YEAR PRISONERS DETERMINED TO GET FREE AND OCCASIONALLY SUCCEEDED IN THEIR EFFORTS
LJ016-0006 THE INSPECTORS' REPORTS MENTION MANY CASES OF EVASION ACCOMPLISHED
LJ016-0007 THERE WERE OTHERS LESS SUCCESSFUL
LJ016-0008 CHARLES THOMAS WHITE AWAITING EXECUTION FOR ARSON MADE A DESPERATE EFFORT TO ESCAPE FROM NEWGATE IN 1827
LJ016-0009 HE HAD FRIENDS AND AUXILIARIES INSIDE THE JAIL AND OUT. THE CELL HE OCCUPIED WAS NEAR THE OUTER WALL
LJ016-0010 AND HAD HE BUT BEEN ABLE TO REMOVE ITS IRON BARS HE MIGHT HAVE DESCENDED INTO NEWGATE STREET BY MEANS OF A ROPE LADDER
LJ016-0011 THE LADDER WAS ACTUALLY MADE OF BLACK SEWINGTHREAD FIRMLY AND CLOSELY INTERWOVEN. BUT WHITE COULD NOT REMOVE THE BARS
LJ016-0012 THE INSTRUMENTS NEEDED FOR THE PURPOSE NEVER REACHED HIM
LJ016-0013 IT WAS NOTICED THAT HE WAS MOST ANXIOUS TO RECEIVE A PAIR OF SHOES FOR WHICH HE HAD ASKED AND WHEN THEY ARRIVED THEY WERE CLOSELY EXAMINED
LJ016-0014 SEWN IN BETWEEN THE UPPER AND LOWER LEATHERS SEVERAL SPRING SAWS WERE FOUND WHICH WOULD HAVE EASILY CUT THROUGH ANY BARS
LJ016-0015 WHITE WHEN TAXED WITH HIS ATTEMPT ADMITTED THAT THE ACCUSATION WAS TRUE AND SPOKE WITH PRIDE AND SATISFACTION OF THE PRACTICABILITY OF HIS SCHEME
LJ016-0016 THERE IS AN ATTEMPT AT ESCAPE MENTIONED IN MR. WAKEFIELD'S BOOK WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN INTENDED SUICIDE
LJ016-0017 JOHN WILLIAMS A YOUNG FELLOW ONLY TWENTYTHREE YEARS OF AGE AWAITED EXECUTION IN 1827 FOR STEALING IN A DWELLINGHOUSE
LJ016-0018 ON THE VERY MORNING ON WHICH HE WAS TO SUFFER HE ELUDED THE VIGILANCE SUCH AS IT WAS OF HIS OFFICERS
LJ016-0019 AND CLIMBED UP THE PIPE OF A CISTERN IN THE CORNER OF THE PRESS YARD SOME THOUGHT WITH THE IDEA OF DROWNING HIMSELF
LJ016-0020 HE NEVER REACHED THE CISTERN BUT FELL BACK INTO THE YARD INJURING HIS LEGS SEVERELY
LJ016-0021 ALTHOUGH HIS EXECUTION WAS IMMINENT A SURGEON ATTENDED TO HIS WOUNDS AND HE WAS CARRIED MORE DEAD THAN ALIVE TO THE SCAFFOLD
LJ016-0022 A HARROWING SCENE FOLLOWED
LJ016-0023 THE WOUNDS BROKE OPEN AND BLED PROFUSELY WHILE THE LAST DREAD PENALTY WAS BEING PERFORMED TO THE MANIFEST EXCITEMENT AND INDIGNATION OF THE CROWD
LJ016-0024 A MORE DARING AND SKILFUL ESCAPE WAS EFFECTED IN 1836 BY THE CHIMNEYSWEEP HENRY WILLIAMS
LJ016-0025 WHO WHILE DETAINED IN THE PRESSYARD AS A CAPITAL CONVICT UNDER SENTENCE OF DEATH FOR BURGLARY
LJ016-0026 MANAGED TO GET AWAY IN THE VERY SAME SPOT WHERE HIS NAMESAKE HAD NINE YEARS BEFORE SO MISERABLY FAILED
LJ016-0027 ESCAPE SEEMED ABSOLUTELY HOPELESS
LJ016-0028 AND WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO ANY ONE LESS NIMBLE THAN A CHIMNEYSWEEP TRAINED UNDER THE OLD SYSTEM TO ASCEND THE MOST INTRICATE FLUES
LJ016-0029 EVEN AFTER WILLIAMS HAD GOT OUT PERSONS WERE DISPOSED TO DISBELIEVE THAT THE ESCAPE HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED IN THE MANNER INDICATED
LJ016-0030 THEY PREFERRED TO CREDIT IT TO CARELESSNESS OR COLLUSION FROM OFFICERS OF THE JAIL
LJ016-0031 YET FROM THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL ACCOUNT GIVEN BY WILLIAMS AFTER RECAPTURE THERE CAN BE LITTLE DOUBT THAT HE GOT AWAY AS WILL BE DESCRIBED
LJ016-0032 WILLIAMS AS A CAPITAL CONVICT WAS LODGED IN THE PRESSYARD OR CONDEMNED WARD
LJ016-0033 HE HAD ACCESS TO THE AIRING YARD AND THERE WAS FOR HOURS NO KIND OF SUPERVISION
LJ016-0034 IN ONE CORNER OF THE AIRING YARD STOOD A CISTERN AT SOME HEIGHT FROM THE GROUND
LJ016-0035 THE WALL BENEATH AND ABOVE IT WAS RUSTICATED IN OTHER WORDS THE GRANITE SURFACE HAD BECOME ROUGHENED AND OFFERED A SORT OF FOOTHOLD
LJ016-0036 ABOUT FIFTY FEET FROM THE GROUND LEVEL AND ABOVE THE CISTERN A REVOLVING CHEVAUXDEFRISE OF IRON WAS FIXED
LJ016-0037 WITH ONLY A SHORT INTERVAL BETWEEN IT AND THE WALL SUPPORTED BY A HORIZONTAL IRON RAILING WITH UPRIGHT POINTS
LJ016-0038 IN THE WALL ABOVE THE CHEVAUXDEFRISE PROJECTED A SERIES OF IRON SPIKES SHARP ENOUGH TO FORBID FURTHER ASCENT
LJ016-0039 WILLIAMS SURVEYED THESE FORMIDABLE OBSTACLES TO EVASION AND CALMLY PROCEEDED TO SURMOUNT THEM
LJ016-0040 HIS FIRST TASK WAS TO GAIN THE TOP OF THE CISTERN THIS HE EFFECTED BY KEEPING HIS BACK TO ONE SIDE OF THE ANGLE
LJ016-0041 AND WORKING WITH HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM WHILE HE USED HIS BARE FEET LIKE CLAWS UPON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL ANGLE
LJ016-0042 THE CONDITION OF THE STONE SURFACE JUST MENTIONED ASSISTED HIM IN THIS AND HE MANAGED TO GET BEYOND THE CISTERN TO THE RAILING BELOW THE CHEVAUXDEFRISE
LJ016-0043 THE LEAST SLIP NOW WOULD HAVE BEEN FATAL TO HIM. BUT HE COULD NOT THRUST HIS BODY IN THROUGH THE NARROW SPACE LEFT BY THE CHEVAUXDEFRISE
LJ016-0044 AND WAS COMPELLED TO WORK ALONG THE RAILING ROUND THREEQUARTERS OF THE SQUARE OF THE YARD
LJ016-0045 AND AT LENGTH REACHED A POINT OPPOSITE THE TOP OF THE BUILDING CONTAINING THE CONDEMNED WARDS. THIS HAD BEEN A PERILOUS AND PAINFUL TASK
LJ016-0046 THE SPIKES OF THE RAILING PENETRATED HIS FLESH AND MADE PROGRESSION SLOW AND DIFFICULT
LJ016-0047 BUT THE WORST PART OF THE BUSINESS WAS TO JUMP FROM THIS IRKSOME FOOTHOLD OF THE IRON GRATING ON TO THE TOP OF THE BUILDING JUST MENTIONED
LJ016-0048 A DISTANCE OF EIGHT OR NINE FEET
LJ016-0049 HE HAD HERE COMPLETED HIS ASCENT
LJ016-0050 HIS NEXT JOB WAS TO DESCEND OUTSIDE NEWGATE
LJ016-0051 CLAMBERING ALONG THE ROOF
LJ016-0052 HE PASSED TO THE TOP OF THE ORDINARY'S RESIDENCE HOPING TO FIND AN OPEN SKYLIGHT BY WHICH HE MIGHT ENTER AND SO WORK DOWNSTAIRS
LJ016-0053 IF THE WORST CAME TO THE WORST HE INTENDED TO HAVE GONE DOWN SOME CHIMNEY AS HE HAD OFTEN DONE BEFORE IN THE WAY OF BUSINESS
LJ016-0054 BUT HE DID NOT LIKE THE RISK OF ENTERING A ROOM BY THE FIREPLACE AND THE CHANCES OF DETECTION IT OFFERED
LJ016-0055 HE TRAVERSED VAINLY ALL THE ROOFS IN NEWGATE STREET
LJ016-0056 RUNNING A GREAT RISK OF DISCOVERY AS HE PASSED BY A LOT OF WORKMEN AT TYLER'S MANUFACTORY IN WARWICK SQUARE WHICH HAD FORMERLY BEEN THE COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS
LJ016-0057 AS HIS COAT WAS AN ENCUMBRANCE HE LEFT IT ON THE TOP OF THE THIRD HOUSE IN NEWGATE STREET AND THUS IN SHIRTSLEEVES BAREFOOT AND BAREHEADED
LJ016-0058 HE WORKED ALONG TO THE ROOFS IN WARWICK LANE
LJ016-0059 HERE HE CAME UPON A WOMAN ON THE LEADS HANGING OUT CLOTHES TO DRY
LJ016-0060 WILLIAMS CONCEALED HIMSELF BEHIND A CHIMNEY TILL SHE HAD REENTERED HER GARRET
LJ016-0061 AND THEN FOLLOWING HER DOWN A STEP LADDER INTO THE HOUSE TOLD HIS STORY APPEALED TO AND WON HER COMPASSION
LJ016-0062 SHE SUFFERED HIM TO PASS DOWNSTAIRS
LJ016-0063 BELOW HE MET ANOTHER WOMAN AND A GIRL BOTH OF WHOM WERE TERRIFIED AT HIS APPEARANCE BUT
LJ016-0064 WHEN HE EXPLAINED THAT HE WAS RUNNING AWAY FROM THE GALLOWS THEY LEFT HIM THE ROAD CLEAR
LJ016-0065 TO WALK OUT INTO THE STREET WAS AN EASY AFFAIR AND HE WAS NOW FREE WITH ONE AND FOURPENCE IN HIS POCKET AND A SHIRT AND TROUSERS FOR ALL HIS CLOTHING
LJ016-0066 DENIED ADMISSION EVERYWHERE AS A RAGGED HALFNAKED BEGGAR
LJ016-0067 HE TRAMPED ACROSS LONDON BRIDGE TO WANDSWORTH WHERE HE REFRESHED HIMSELF WITH A PINT OF STRONG ALE THE FIRST SUSTENANCE HE HAD TAKEN SINCE HIS ESCAPE
LJ016-0068 AND CONTINUED HIS MARCH TO KINGSTON WHERE HE SLEPT SOUNDLY UNDER A HEDGE TILL NEXT MORNING
LJ016-0069 ENTERING A TOWN HE OBTAINED EMPLOYMENT AT ONCE AS A CHIMNEYSWEEP
LJ016-0070 FROM A WIDOW WOMAN WHO GAVE HIM BUB AND GRUB OR FOOD AND ONEANDSIXPENCE FOR EVERY NINE DAYS' WORK
LJ016-0071 DISSATISFIED WITH THIS REMUNERATION HE AGAIN TOOK TO THE ROAD AND TRAMPED INTO HAMPSHIRE
LJ016-0072 WHERE HE PRESENTLY COMMITTED A BURGLARY AT LYMINGTON WAS CAUGHT AND LODGED IN WINCHESTER JAIL
LJ016-0073 MR. COPE THE GOVERNOR OF NEWGATE HAVING BEEN COMMUNICATED WITH PROCEEDED TO WINCHESTER WHERE HE AT ONCE IDENTIFIED WILLIAMS
LJ016-0074 THE SUCCESS ALTHOUGH VERY SHORTLIVED WHICH ATTENDED HIM NO DOUBT INSPIRED OTHER INMATES OF NEWGATE TO FOLLOW HIS EXAMPLE
LJ016-0075 IT WAS FOR SOME TIME AFTER THIS A CONSTANT PRACTICE TO GO UP THE CHIMNEYS IN THE HOPES OF ESCAPING BY THE FLUE
LJ016-0076 EVEN THEN HOWEVER IRONS ACROSS BARRED THE ASCENT AFTER A CERTAIN DISTANCE AND IN NO ONE CASE DID A FUGITIVE GET CLEAR AWAY
LJ016-0077 A MAN NAMED LEARS UNDER SENTENCE OF TRANSPORTATION FOR AN ATTEMPT AT MURDER ON BOARD SHIP GOT UP PART OF THE WAY
LJ016-0078 BUT HAD TO COME DOWN AGAIN COVERED WITH SOOT AND FILTH JUST AS THE OFFICERS ENTERED THE WARD
LJ016-0079 LEARS WAS REWARDED BY BEING OBLIGED TO WEAR CROSS IRONS ON HIS LEGS A PUNISHMENT RARELY INFLICTED IN NEWGATE
LJ016-0080 AND PROBABLY ONE OF THE FEW CASES OF A RECURRENCE BUT UNDER PROPER SAFEGUARDS AND LIMITATIONS TO THE OLD SYSTEM OF CHAINS
LJ016-0081 ON ANOTHER OCCASION MR. COPE THE GOVERNOR CAME IN AND MISSED A MAN
LJ016-0082 THE WARD WAS ONE SHORT OF ITS NUMBER. WHAT HAD BECOME OF THE FELLOW
LJ016-0084 THE FUGITIVE UNCOMFORTABLY ENSCONCED IN THE FLUE CAME DOWN OF HIS OWN ACCORD LIKE COLONEL COLT'S RACCOON
LJ016-0085 AFTER THIS GREAT IRON GUARDS JUST AS ARE TO BE SEEN IN LUNATIC ASYLUMS
LJ016-0086 WERE FIXED OVER THE FIREPLACES AND THE PRISONERS HAD NO LONGER ACCESS TO THE CHIMNEYS
LJ016-0087 AMONG THE ESCAPES STILL REMEMBERED WAS ONE IN EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE ACCOMPLISHED BY A MAN WHO HAD BEEN EMPLOYED
LJ016-0088 WORKING AT THE ROOF OF THE CHAPEL ON THE FEMALE SIDE
LJ016-0089 HE WAS ENGAGED IN WHITEWASHING AND CLEANING THE OFFICER WHO HAD HIM IN CHARGE LEFT HIM ON THE STAIRS LEADING TO THE GALLERY
LJ016-0090 TAKING ADVANTAGE OF BEING UNOBSERVED HE GOT OUT THROUGH THE ROOF ON TO THE LEADS AND TRAVELED ALONG THEM TOWARDS NO. 1 NEWGATE STREET
LJ016-0091 THIS WAS A PUBLICHOUSE
LJ016-0092 HE STEPPED IN AT A GARRET WINDOW COOLLY WALKED DOWNSTAIRS AND ENTERED THE BAR
LJ016-0093 THEY ASKED HIM HOW HE HAD CUT HIS HAND WHICH WAS BLEEDING AND HE SAID HE HAD DONE IT WHILE WORKING UP ON THE ROOF
LJ016-0094 NO FURTHER NOTICE WAS TAKEN OF HIM NO ONE SEEMINGLY SUSPECTED THAT HE WAS A PRISONER AND HE WAS SUFFERED TO WALK OFF WITHOUT LET OR HINDRANCE
LJ016-0095 IN 1853 THREE MEN ESCAPED IN COMPANY FROM ONE OF THE WARDS IN THE MIDDLE YARD
LJ016-0096 THEY WERE PENAL SERVITUDE MEN THEIR NAMES BELL BROWN AND BARRY AND THEY WERE AWAITING TRANSFER TO LEICESTER
LJ016-0097 WHICH WITH WAKEFIELD WAS UTILIZED AS A RECEPTACLE FOR CONVICTS NOT GOING TO WESTERN AUSTRALIA
LJ016-0098 OR ANY OF THE NEW ESTABLISHMENTS AT HOME AT PORTLAND DARTMOOR OR ELSEWHERE
LJ016-0099 THESE MEN MANAGED TO CUT A HOLE IN THE CEILING OF THE WARD NEAR THE IRON CAGE ON THE LANDING AND SO GOT ACCESS TO THE ROOF
LJ016-0100 AT THAT TIME ROPE MATS WERE STILL USED AS BEDS
LJ016-0101 ONE OF THE THREE SHAMMING ILL REMAINED ALL DAY IN HIS WARD WHERE HE EMPLOYED HIMSELF UNRAVELING THE ROPE FROM THE SLEEPINGMATS
LJ016-0102 BY EVENING HE MANUFACTURED A GOOD LONG LENGTH
LJ016-0103 AND AFTER ALL WAS QUIET THE THREE GOT ON TO THE ROOF THROUGH THE HOLE AND SO ON TO TYLER'S MANUFACTORY CLOSE BY
LJ016-0104 WHENCE THEY LET THEMSELVES DOWN INTO THE STREET BY THE ROPE
LJ016-0105 THESE MEN WERE ALL IN PRISON DRESS AT THE TIME OF THEIR ESCAPE BUT ONE OF THEIR NUMBER BELL SENT BACK HIS CLOTHES A FEW DAYS LATER BY PARCEL'S DELIVERY
LJ016-0106 WITH A CIVIL NOTE TO THE GOVERNOR SAYING HE HAD NO FURTHER USE FOR THEM. ALL THREE FUGITIVES WERE RECAPTURED
LJ016-0107 BROWN ALMOST AT ONCE THEN BARRY WHO WAS TAKEN AT THE EAST END IN A PUBLICHOUSE WHERE HE HAD ARRANGED TO MEET A PAL
LJ016-0108 THE NEWGATE OFFICERS OBTAINED INFORMATION OF THIS AND WENT TO THE SPOT WHERE THEY EFFECTED THE CAPTURE
LJ016-0109 BUT NOT TILL THEY HAD HAD AN EXCITING CHASE DOWN THE STREET
LJ016-0110 THE THIRD BELL REMAINED LONGEST AT LARGE. HE TOO WAS RUN INTO AT A LODGING IN THE KINGSLAND ROAD
LJ016-0111 THE OFFICERS DROPPED ON TO HIM WHILE HE WAS STILL IN BED BUT AS THEY CAME UPSTAIRS HE JUMPED UP AND HID IN A CUPBOARD
LJ016-0112 ALL THREE AFTER RECAPTURE PASSED ON AS ORIGINALLY INTENDED TO LEICESTER WHERE THEY DID THEIR BIT AND WERE RELEASED
LJ016-0113 BUT ONLY TO BE TAKEN SOON AFTERWARDS FOR A FRESH OFFENSE AND AGAIN PASS THROUGH NEWGATE WITH SENTENCES OF PENAL SERVITUDE
LJ016-0114 A LATER CASE WAS STILL MORE REMARKABLE AS IT WAS EFFECTED AFTER THE ALTERATION OF THE PRISON AND ITS RECONSTRUCTION ON THE NEWEST LINES
LJ016-0115 A SAILOR KRAPPS BY NAME OCCUPIED ONE OF THE UPPER CELLS IN THE NEW BLOCK
LJ016-0116 THE DOORS THROUGH INCOMPLETE KNOWLEDGE OF PRISON NEEDS WERE NOT AS NOW SHEETED WITH IRON
LJ016-0117 THE PRISONER HAD NOTHING TO DEAL WITH BUT WOODEN PANELS AND BY DINT OF CUTTING AND CHOPPING HE GOT BOTH THE LOWER PANELS OUT
LJ016-0118 THROUGH THE APERTURE HE CREPT OUT ON TO THE LANDING AT THE DEAD OF NIGHT AND SO DOWN INTO THE CENTRAL SPACE OF THE BUILDING
LJ016-0119 UNDER SUPERIOR ORDERS ALL THE DOORS AND GATES OF THIS BLOCK WERE LEFT OPEN AT NIGHT TO ALLOW THE NIGHT WATCHMAN TO PASS FREELY TO ALL PARTS
LJ016-0120 THIS WAS CONSIDERED SAFER THAN INTRUSTING HIM WITH KEYS
LJ016-0121 KRAPPS WALKED AT ONCE INTO THE YARD AND ACROSS TO THE FEMALE SIDE WHERE HE FOUND SOME OF THE WASHING STILL HANGING OUT TO DRY
LJ016-0122 HE MADE A STRONG ROPE WITH SEVERAL OF THE SHEETS THEN RETURNING TO THE MALE YARD
LJ016-0123 GOT HOLD OF THE STEP LADDER USED IN LIGHTING THE GAS AND WHICH UNDER OUR MORE CAREFUL SUPERVISION WOULD HAVE BEEN AS NOWADAYS CHAINED UP
LJ016-0124 CUTTING THE CORD WHICH FASTENED THE TWO LEGS OF THE STEP LADDER HE OPENED THEM OUT AND MADE ONE LONG LENGTH
LJ016-0125 WITH THIS PLACED AGAINST THE WALL NEAR THE CHEVAUXDEFRISE HE MADE AN ESCALADE
LJ016-0126 THE TOP OF THE WALL WAS GAINED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY
LJ016-0127 ALONG THIS KRAPPS CRAWLED AND THEN DROPPED DOWN ON TO THE COOKHOUSE
LJ016-0128 HE NOW PUT IN REQUISITION THE ROPE MADE OF THE SHEETS AND WITH ITS HELP LOWERED HIMSELF INTO THE STREET
LJ016-0129 DOWN BELOW WERE MARKETCARTS WAITING FOR DAYLIGHT AND AMONG THEM KRAPPS FOUND A REFUGE AND FRIENDS
LJ016-0130 THE FIRST INTIMATION OF HIS ESCAPE WAS AFFORDED BY THE POLICE WHO INFORMED THE PRISON AUTHORITIES NEXT DAY THAT A ROPE WAS HANGING DOWN FROM THE COOKHOUSE ROOF
LJ016-0131 NOTHING MORE WAS HEARD OF KRAPPS. THE CURIOUS THING IN HIS CASE WAS THAT HIS OFFENSE WAS A TRIFLING ONE
LJ016-0132 HE WAS STILL UNTRIED BUT WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY HAVE ESCAPED WITH A MINOR PENALTY SAY OF THREE OR FOUR MONTHS' IMPRISONMENT
LJ016-0133 THERE IS HOWEVER NO EXPLANATION OF THE MOTIVES WHICH PROMPT PRISONERS TO ATTEMPT ESCAPES
LJ016-0134 CASES WELL AUTHENTICATED HAVE BEEN KNOWN OF MEN WHO HAD ALL BUT COMPLETED THEIR SENTENCES AND FOR WHOM THE PRISON GATES WOULD OPEN WITHIN A FEW DAYS
LJ016-0135 WHO YET FACED EXTRAORDINARY RISKS TO ADVANCE THEIR ENLARGEMENT BY ONLY A FEW HOURS
LJ016-0136 ON THE OTHER HAND AT THE GREAT CONVICT ESTABLISHMENTS SUCH IS THE MORAL RESTRAINT OF A SYSTEMATIC DISCIPLINE
LJ016-0137 THAT NUMBERS OF MEN LIFERS AND OTHERS WITH TEN FOURTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS TO DO CAN BE TRUSTED TO WORK OUT OF DOORS WITHOUT BOLTS AND BARS
LJ016-0138 AT A DISTANCE FROM THE PRISON
LJ016-0139 THE LAST ESCAPE FROM NEWGATE WAS ONLY THREE YEARS AGO AND OCCURRED JUST BEFORE THE FINAL CLOSING OF THE PRISON
LJ016-0140 NO REPORT OF IT WAS MADE PUBLIC AS THE MAN WAS ALMOST IMMEDIATELY RECAPTURED
LJ016-0141 HE WAS AT WORK UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE ARTISAN WARDER OF THE PRISON
LJ016-0142 WHO PERMITTED HIM TO GO UP ON TO THE ROOF OF THE OLD WARDS IN ORDER TO THROW WATER FOR FLUSHING PURPOSES DOWN A SHOOT
LJ016-0143 HE WAS OUT OF SIGHT WHILE SO EMPLOYED AND REMAINED SO LONG ABSENT THAT THE WARDER BECOMING UNEASY WENT IN SEARCH OF HIM
LJ016-0144 HE HAD DISAPPEARED
LJ016-0145 ENCOURAGED BY THE SHOUTS AND SIGNALS OF SOME WORKMEN EMPLOYED ON A BUILDING OUTSIDE THE PRISONER MADE ONE OF THE MOST MARVELLOUS JUMPS ON RECORD
LJ016-0146 FROM THE BUILDING HE WAS ON TO A DISTANT WALL WITH A DROP OF SIXTY FEET BETWEEN
LJ016-0147 THEN HE RAN ALONG THE COPING OF THE WALL TOWARDS ITS ANGLE WITH TYLER'S MANUFACTORY AND DROPPED DOWN ON TO THE GRIDIRON BELOW
LJ016-0148 THIS WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO CARRY HIM AND HE FELL THROUGH
LJ016-0149 SUICIDES AND EXECUTIONS WERE HOWEVER ALWAYS THE MOST EFFECTUAL METHODS OF MAKING EXIT FROM DURANCE
LJ016-0150 SUICIDES AT NEWGATE WERE NUMEROUS ENOUGH BUT THEY SELDOM POSSESSED ANY NOVEL OR UNUSUAL FEATURES
LJ016-0151 PRISON SUICIDES SELDOM DO EXCEPT AS REGARDS INGENUITY AND DETERMINATION
LJ016-0152 ONLY GREAT RESOLUTION INDEED PERSISTED IN TO THE BITTER END
LJ016-0153 WOULD MAKE DEATH A CERTAINTY SO LIMITED AND IMPERFECT ARE THE MEANS GENERALLY AVAILABLE
LJ016-0154 WHEN A BIT OF ROPE CAREFULLY SECRETED
LJ016-0155 BRACES SHOESTRINGS SHIRT TORN INTO STRIPS ARE THE ONLY INSTRUMENTS AND A BAR OR SMALL HOOK
LJ016-0156 AT NO ELEVATION AFFORDS THE ONLY DROP STRANGULATION WOULD SELDOM SUPERVENE BUT FOR THE RESOLUTION OF THE MISERABLE FELO DE SE
LJ016-0157 ONE CURIOUS INSTANCE OF A SUICIDE CARRIED OUT UNDER THE MOST ADVERSE AND EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES MAY BE QUOTED
LJ016-0158 IT WAS THAT OF A LONG FIRM SWINDLER BY NAME JOHNSON
LJ016-0159 WHO CONTRIVED TO HANG HIMSELF FROM A HAMMOCK HOOK ONLY EIGHTEEN INCHES FROM THE GROUND
LJ016-0160 THE NOOSE WAS ONE OF HIS HAMMOCK STRAPS WHICH HE BUCKLED ROUND HIS THROAT
LJ016-0161 HAVING CAREFULLY SPREAD OUT A BLANKET ON THE FLOOR JUST BELOW THE HAMMOCK AS IT LAY SUSPENDED
LJ016-0162 HE FASTENED ONE END OF THE STRAP ABOVE MENTIONED TO THE HOOK AND THEN FELL DOWN
LJ016-0163 HE MIGHT HAVE SAVED HIMSELF AT ANY MOMENT BY MERELY EXTENDING AN ARM BUT HE LAY THERE PATIENTLY TILL DEATH SUPERVENED
LJ016-0164 WHEN DISCOVERED NEXT MORNING QUITE DEAD IT WAS FOUND THAT THE STRAP ACTUALLY DID NOT TOUCH HIS THROAT
LJ016-0165 THREE FINGERS MIGHT HAVE BEEN INSERTED BETWEEN IT AND THE FLESH THE PRESSURE WAS ALL ON THE ARTERIES BEHIND THE EARS
LJ016-0166 AND SURGICAL OPINION STATED THAT THE STOPPAGE OF CIRCULATION WAS THE CAUSE OF DEATH
LJ016-0167 PROBABLY DISSOLUTION CAME AS EASILY AND ALMOST WITHOUT PAIN
LJ016-0168 A LAUDABLE DESIRE TO INVEST EXECUTIONS WITH MORE AND MORE SOLEMNITY AND DECORUM GAINED GROUND AS THEY BECAME MORE RARE
LJ016-0169 AS MORE HUMANE PRINCIPLES WERE INTRODUCED INTO PRISON MANAGEMENT
LJ016-0170 GREATER ATTENTION WAS PAID TO THE CAPITAL CONVICTS AND THE HORRORS OF THEIR SITUATION WHILE AWAITING SENTENCE
LJ016-0171 WERE AS FAR AS POSSIBLE MITIGATED AND TONED DOWN. BUT THERE WAS LITTLE IMPROVEMENT IN THE CEREMONY ITSELF
LJ016-0172 THERE WERE STILL UNTOWARD ACCIDENTS OCCASIONALLY AT EXECUTIONS AND EVEN THE CHIEF PRACTITIONER OF RECENT TIMES CALCRAFT
LJ016-0173 WAS NOT ALWAYS TO BE TRUSTED TO DO HIS FELL WORK EFFICIENTLY
LJ016-0174 HAVING MENTIONED CALCRAFT'S NAME
LJ016-0175 I MAY BE PERMITTED TO DIGRESS FOR A MOMENT TO GIVE A FEW PARTICULARS CONCERNING THE LAST OFFICIALLY APPOINTED HANGMAN OF THE CITY OF LONDON
LJ016-0176 AFTER CALCRAFT'S RESIGNATION NO SUCCESSOR WAS REALLY APPOINTED
LJ016-0177 MARWOOD WHOSE NAME IS SO FAMILIAR WITH THE PRESENT GENERATION
LJ016-0178 HAD NO OFFICIAL STATUS AND WAS MERELY AN OPERATOR SELECTED BY THE CORPORATION AND WHO ON THE STRENGTH OF IT
LJ016-0179 CONTRACTED WITH SHERIFFS AND CONVENERS TO WORK BY THE JOB
LJ016-0180 BUT CALCRAFT REGULARLY SUCCEEDED FOXEN WHO FOLLOWED BOTTING AND DENNIS THE ACTOR IN THE 1780 RIOTS
LJ016-0181 CALCRAFT WAS BORN AT BADDOW IN ESSEX IN 1800
LJ016-0182 HE WAS A SHOEMAKER BY TRADE AND SETTLED IN LONDON AFTER HIS MARRIAGE IN 1825
LJ016-0183 THE STORY GOES THAT ABOUT EIGHTEEN TWENTY EIGHT
LJ016-0184 HIS ATTENTION WAS DRAWN EARLY ONE MORNING TO A MAN WHO LEANT AGAINST A LAMPPOST IN FINSBURY SQUARE COUGHING VIOLENTLY
LJ016-0185 CALCRAFT WHO IN SPITE OF THE DREADFUL CALLING HE SUBSEQUENTLY FOLLOWED WAS ALWAYS REPUTED A KINDLY MAN
LJ016-0186 INVITED THE MAN WITH THE COUGH TO ENTER A NEIGHBORING HOUSE AND TRY A LITTLE PEPPERMINT FOR IT
LJ016-0187 THE OTHER ACCEPTED AND THEY GOT INTO CONVERSATION
LJ016-0188 HE TOLD CALCRAFT THAT HE WAS FOXEN THE EXECUTIONER AND THAT HE WAS THAT MOMENT ON HIS WAY TO NEWGATE TO HANG A MAN
LJ016-0189 BUT THAT HIS COUGH WAS GETTING SO MUCH THE MASTER OF HIM THAT HE FEARED HE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CARRY ON HIS DUTIES MUCH LONGER
LJ016-0190 I HAVE NO IDEA WHO THE SHERIFFS WILL GET TO DO THE WORK AFTER ME SAID FOXEN ADDING THAT HIS ASSISTANT TOM CHESHIRE
LJ016-0191 WAS GIVEN TO DRINK AND NOT TO BE TRUSTED
LJ016-0192 I THINK I COULD DO THAT SORT OF JOB SAID CALCRAFT ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
LJ016-0193 FOXEN ASKED HIM HIS NAME AND ADDRESS AND WENT AWAY
LJ016-0194 CALCRAFT THOUGHT NO MORE OF WHAT HAD OCCURRED TILL THE NEXT SESSIONS AT THE OLD BAILEY WHEN THE SHERIFFS SENT FOR HIM
LJ016-0195 AND OFFERED HIM THE POST OF EXECUTIONER FOR THE CITY OF LONDON AND MIDDLESEX
LJ016-0196 HE ACCEPTED HAVING AT FIRST TOM CHESHIRE AS HIS ASSISTANT THEN FOR A TIME WHEN CHESHIRE WAS DISMISSED FOR DRUNKENNESS A MAN NAMED OSBORNE
LJ016-0197 AFTER THAT HE WORKED ALONE
LJ016-0198 I CANNOT FIND THAT CALCRAFT WAS SWORN IN WHEN APPOINTED OR ANY EXACT INFORMATION WHEN THE OLD FORBIDDING CEREMONY CEASED TO BE PRACTICED
LJ016-0199 IT WAS CUSTOMARY TO MAKE THE EXECUTIONER TAKE THE BIBLE IN HIS HAND AND SWEAR SOLEMNLY THAT HE WOULD DISPATCH EVERY CRIMINAL CONDEMNED TO DIE
LJ016-0200 WITHOUT FAVORING FATHER OR MOTHER OR ANY OTHER RELATION OR FRIEND
LJ016-0201 WHEN HE HAD TAKEN THE OATH HE WAS DISMISSED WITH THE WORDS GET THEE HENCE WRETCH
LJ016-0202 CALCRAFT'S EMOLUMENTS WERE A GUINEA PER WEEK AND AN EXTRA GUINEA FOR EVERY EXECUTION
LJ016-0203 HE GOT BESIDES HALFACROWN FOR EVERY MAN HE FLOGGED AND AN ALLOWANCE TO PROVIDE CATS OR BIRCH RODS
LJ016-0204 FOR ACTING AS EXECUTIONER OF HORSEMONGER LANE JAIL
LJ016-0205 HE RECEIVED A RETAINING FEE OF £5 5 SHILLINGS WITH THE USUAL GUINEA FOR EACH JOB
LJ016-0206 HE WAS ALSO AT LIBERTY TO ENGAGE HIMSELF IN THE COUNTRY WHERE HE DEMANDED AND WAS PAID £10 ON EACH OCCASION
LJ016-0207 IT WAS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO GET A HANGMAN SO CHEAP AS I HAVE ALREADY INDICATED ON A PREVIOUS PAGE
LJ016-0208 THE ONUS AND RESPONSIBILITY OF CARRYING OUT THE SENTENCE IS PERSONAL TO THE SHERIFF A GOOD STORY IS TOLD ILLUSTRATING THIS
LJ016-0209 SOME WAGS IN SCOTLAND SEIZED CALCRAFT AND KEPT HIM IN DURANCE THE NIGHT BEFORE THE EXECUTION
LJ016-0210 MEANWHILE THE CONVENER OR SHERIFF WAS IN DESPAIR EXPECTING THAT FAILING THE EXECUTIONER HE WOULD HAVE TO DO THE JOB HIMSELF
LJ016-0211 BUT FORTUNATELY FOR HIM JUST AT THE LAST MOMENT CALCRAFT WAS SET FREE
LJ016-0212 CALCRAFT'S SALARY WAS MORE THAN THE PROVERBIAL THIRTEENPENCE HALFPENNY  HANGMAN'S WAGES
LJ016-0213 THE ORIGIN OF THIS EXPRESSION DATES IT IS SAID FROM THE TIME WHEN THE SCOTTISH MARK
LJ016-0214 A SILVER COIN BEARING THE SAME RELATION TO THE SCOTTISH POUND THAT AN ENGLISH SHILLING DOES TO AN ENGLISH POUND WAS MADE TO PASS CURRENT IN ENGLAND
LJ016-0215 THE MARK WAS VALUED AT THIRTEENPENCE HALFPENNY OR RATHER MORE THAN THE SHILLING WHICH FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL HAD BEEN THE HANGMAN'S WAGES
LJ016-0216 THAT VERY ANCIENT PERQUISITE THE CONVICT'S CLOTHES WAS NEVER CLAIMED BY CALCRAFT AND IT MAY BE DOUBTED WHETHER HE WAS ENTITLED TO IT
LJ016-0217 ON ONE PARTICULAR OCCASION HOWEVER HE GOT THEM. A GENTLEMAN WHOSE SINS BROUGHT HIM TO THE GALLOWS AT MAIDSTONE
LJ016-0218 WISHED TO DO CALCRAFT A GOOD TURN AND SENT TO HIS LONDON TAILOR FOR A COMPLETE NEW SUIT IN WHICH HE APPEARED AT HIS EXECUTION
LJ016-0219 HE EXPRESSLY BEQUEATHED THEM TO CALCRAFT WHO WAS GRACIOUSLY PLEASED TO ACCEPT THEM
LJ016-0220 ON ANOTHER OCCASION AN IMPORTUNATE PERSON BEGGED CALCRAFT EAGERLY TO CLAIM HIS RIGHT TO THE CLOTHES AND GIVE THEM TO HIM
LJ016-0221 CALCRAFT CONSENTED GOT AND BESTOWED THE CLOTHES ONLY TO FIND THAT THE PERSON HE HAD OBLIGED EXHIBITED THEM PUBLICLY
LJ016-0222 IT MAY BE ADDED THAT OF LATE YEARS THE CLOTHES IN WHICH A CONVICT HAS SUFFERED ARE INVARIABLY BURNT
LJ016-0223 CAPITAL CONVICTS GO TO THE GALLOWS IN THEIR OWN CLOTHING AND NOT IN PRISON DRESS UNLESS THE FORMER IS QUITE UNFIT TO BE WORN
LJ016-0224 CALCRAFT SHARED THE ODIUM WHICH HIS OFFICE NOT STRANGELY HAS ALWAYS INSPIRED. BUT HE WAS ADMITTED INTO THE JAIL
LJ016-0225 WHICH HIS PREDECESSORS WERE NOT AND WHO WERE PAID THEIR WAGES OVER THE GATE TO OBVIATE THE NECESSITY FOR LETTING THEM ENTER
LJ016-0226 TO THIS CURIOUS ETIQUETTE WAS DUE THE APPOINTMENT OF AN OFFICIAL WHOSE OFFICE HAS LONG SINCE DISAPPEARED THE YEOMAN OF THE HALTER
LJ016-0227 WHOSE BUSINESS IT WAS TO PROVIDE THE ROPE AND DO THE PINIONING AND WHO WAS PAID A FEE OF FIVE SHILLINGS
LJ016-0228 THEY DID NOT DISLIKE CALCRAFT HOWEVER AT NEWGATE. HE WAS AN ILLITERATE SIMPLEMINDED MAN WHO SCARCELY REMEMBERED WHAT EXECUTIONS HE HAD PERFORMED
LJ016-0229 HE KEPT NO RECORD OF THEM AND WHEN ASKED QUESTIONS REFERRED TO THE OFFICERS OF THE JAIL
LJ016-0230 HIS NATURE MUST HAVE BEEN KINDLY
LJ016-0231 WHEN HE CAME TO THE PRISON FOR HIS WAGES HIS GRANDCHILDREN OFTEN ACCOMPANIED HIM AFFECTIONATELY CLINGING TO HIS HANDS
LJ016-0232 AND HE OWNED A PET PONY WHICH WOULD FOLLOW HIM ABOUT LIKE A DOG
LJ016-0233 IN HIS OWN PROFESSION
LJ016-0234 HE WAS NOT UNSKILFUL BUT HE PROCEEDED ENTIRELY BY RULE OF THUMB LEAVING THE RESULT VERY MUCH TO CHANCE AND THE STRENGTH OF THE ROPE
LJ016-0235 HE WAS SO MUCH IN FAVOR OF SHORT DROPS THAT HIS IMMEDIATE SUCCESSOR MARWOOD STIGMATIZED HIM AS SHORTDROP MAN
LJ016-0236 MARWOOD BEING ON THE OTHER HAND IN FAVOR OF GIVING A MAN AS MUCH ROPE AS POSSIBLE
LJ016-0237 WITH CALCRAFT'S METHOD THERE WERE UNDOUBTEDLY MANY FAILURES AND IT WAS A COMMON CUSTOM FOR HIM TO GO BELOW THE GALLOWS
LJ016-0238 JUST TO STEADY THEIR LEGS A LITTLE IN OTHER WORDS TO ADD HIS WEIGHT TO THAT OF THE HANGING BODIES
LJ016-0239 MARWOOD TILL LATTERLY SEEMED TO HAVE DONE HIS WORK MORE EFFECTUALLY AND HAS BEEN KNOWN TO GIVE AS MUCH AS SIX FEET FALL
LJ016-0240 THIS GENERALLY PRODUCES INSTANTANEOUS DEATH ALTHOUGH CASES WHERE COMPLETE FRACTURE OF THE SPINAL CORD OCCURRED ARE SAID TO BE RARE
LJ016-0241 CALCRAFT SERVED THE CITY OF LONDON TILL 1874 WHEN HE WAS PENSIONED AT THE RATE OF TWENTYFIVE SHILLINGS PER WEEK
LJ016-0242 THE LAST EXECUTION AT WHICH HE ACTED WAS THAT OF GODWIN ON THE 25TH MAY 1874
LJ016-0243 MARWOOD WHO SUCCEEDED HIM AND WHO DIED WHILE THESE SHEETS WERE IN THE PRESS WAS A LINCOLNSHIRE MAN A NATIVE OF HORNCASTLE
LJ016-0244 WHO FIRST TOOK TO THE WORK FROM PREDILECTION AND THE IDEA OF BEING USEFUL IN HIS GENERATION AS HE HIMSELF ASSURED THE WRITER OF THESE PAGES
LJ016-0245 UNTIL THE TIME OF HIS DEATH HE KEPT A SMALL SHOP CLOSE TO THE CHURCH IN HORNCASTLE
LJ016-0246 OVER THE DOOR IN GILT LETTERS WERE THE WORDS CROWN OFFICE IN THE WINDOW WAS A PILE OF OFFICIAL ENVELOPES OSTENTATIOUSLY DISPLAYED
LJ016-0247 WHILE ROUND ABOUT WERE SHOESTRINGS BOOTLACES AND LASTS. MARWOOD STRANGE TO SAY FOLLOWED THE SAME TRADE AS CALCRAFT
LJ016-0248 MARWOOD WAS PROUD OF HIS CALLING AND WHEN QUESTIONED AS TO WHETHER HIS PROCESS WAS SATISFACTORY REPLIED THAT HE HEARD NO COMPLAINTS
LJ016-0249 THE STRANGE COMPETITION AMONGST HUNDREDS TO SUCCEED MARWOOD IS A STRANGE FACT TOO RECENTLY BEFORE THE PUBLIC TO NEED MENTION HERE
LJ016-0250 IT MAY HOWEVER BE REMARKED THAT THE WISDOM OF APPOINTING ANY REGULAR HANGMAN IS VERY OPEN TO QUESTION
LJ016-0251 AND MUST BE STRONGLY DEPRECATED ON MORAL GROUNDS AS TENDING TO THE UTTER DEGRADATION OF ONE INDIVIDUAL
LJ016-0252 POSSIBLY SUCH CHANGES MAY BE INTRODUCED INTO THE METHOD OF EXECUTION
LJ016-0253 THAT THE CEREMONY MAY BE MADE MORE MECHANICAL THUS RENDERING THE PERSONAL INTERVENTION OF A SKILLED FUNCTIONARY UNNECESSARY
LJ016-0254 EXECUTIONS LONG CONTINUED TO BE IN PUBLIC IN SPITE OF REMONSTRANCE AND REPROBATION
LJ016-0255 THE OLD PREJUDICES SUCH AS THAT WHICH ENLISTED DR. JOHNSON ON THE SIDE OF THE TYBURN PROCESSION STILL LINGERED AND PREVENTED ANY CHANGE
LJ016-0256 IT WAS THOUGHT THAT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT WOULD LOSE ITS DETERRENT EFFECT IF IT CEASED TO BE PUBLIC
LJ016-0257 AND THE RAISON D'ÊTRE OF THE PENALTY WHICH IN PRINCIPLE SO MANY OPPOSED WOULD BE GONE
LJ016-0258 THIS LINE OF ARGUMENT PREVAILED OVER THE MANIFEST HORRORS OF THE SPECTACLE. THESE INCREASED AS TIME PASSED
LJ016-0259 THE GRAPHIC AND TERRIBLE ACCOUNT GIVEN BY CHARLES DICKENS OF THE AWFUL SCENE BEFORE HORSEMONGER LANE JAIL AT THE EXECUTION OF THE MANNINGS
LJ016-0260 HAS ALREADY BEEN QUOTED. AGAIN THE CONCOURSE OF PEOPLE COLLECTED IN FRONT OF NEWGATE TO WITNESS THE EXECUTION
LJ016-0261 SIMULTANEOUSLY OF THE FIVE PIRATES PART OF THE MUTINOUS CREW OF THE 'FLOWERY LAND' WAS GREATER THAN ON ANY PREVIOUS OCCASION
LJ016-0262 IT WAS A CALLOUS CARELESS CROWD OF COARSEMINDED SEMIBRUTALIZED FOLK WHO CAME TO ENJOY THEMSELVES
LJ016-0263 FEW IF ANY SHOWED ANY FEELING OF TERROR NONE WERE IMPRESSED WITH THE SOLEMNITY OR REALIZED THE WARNING WHICH THE SIGHT CONVEYED
LJ016-0264 THE UPTURNED FACES OF THE EAGER SPECTATORS RESEMBLED THOSE OF THE 'GODS' AT DRURY LANE ON BOXING NIGHT
LJ016-0265 THE CROWD HAD COME TO WITNESS A POPULAR AND GRATUITOUS PUBLIC PERFORMANCE  BETTER THAN A PRIZEFIGHT OR A PLAY
LJ016-0266 NO NOTION THAT THEY WERE ASSISTING AT A VINDICATION OF THE LAW FILLED THE MINDS OF THOSE PRESENT WITH DREAD
LJ016-0267 ON THE CONTRARY THE PREVAILING SENTIMENT WAS ONE OF SATISFACTION AT THE SUCCESS OF THE SPECTACLE
LJ016-0268 THE REMARKS HEARD AMONGST THE CROWD WERE OF COARSE APPROVAL
LJ016-0271 THE REPLY EVINCED EQUAL SATISFACTION AND THE SPEAKER WITH A PROFANE OATH DECLARED THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO ACT AS JACK KETCH TO THE WHOLE LOT
LJ016-0272 TO THE DISGRACE OF THE BETTEREDUCATED AND BETTERBRED PUBLIC EXECUTIONS COULD STILL COMMAND THE ATTENDANCE OF CURIOUS ARISTOCRATS FROM THE WEST END
LJ016-0273 AT MÜLLER'S EXECUTION THERE WAS GREAT COMPETITION FOR FRONT SEATS
LJ016-0274 AND THE WINDOWS OF THE OPPOSITE HOUSES WHICH COMMANDED A GOOD VIEW AS USUAL FETCHED HIGH PRICES
LJ016-0275 AS MUCH AS £25 WAS PAID FOR A FIRSTFLOOR FRONT ON THIS OCCASION
LJ016-0276 NEVER INDEED HAD AN EXECUTION BEEN MORE GENERALLY PATRONIZED
LJ016-0277 THIS IS PROVED BY CONTEMPORARY ACCOUNTS ESPECIALLY ONE GRAPHIC AND REALISTIC ARTICLE WHICH APPEARED IN THE 'TIMES'
LJ016-0278 AND WHICH CONTRIBUTED IN NO SMALL DEGREE TO THE INTRODUCTION OF PRIVATE EXECUTIONS. A GREAT CROWD WAS EXPECTED AND A GREAT CROWD CAME
LJ016-0279 THEY COLLECTED OVER NIGHT IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF A NOVEMBER MOON
LJ016-0280 THERE WERE WELLDRESSED AND ILLDRESSED OLD MEN AND LADS WOMEN AND GIRLS
LJ016-0281 RAIN FELL HEAVILY AT INTERVALS BUT DID NOT THIN THE CONCOURSE
LJ016-0282 TILL THREE O'CLOCK IT WAS ONE LONG REVELRY OF SONGS AND LAUGHTER SHOUTING AND OFTEN QUARRELING THOUGH
LJ016-0283 TO DO THEM MERE JUSTICE THERE WAS AT LEAST TILL THEN A HALFDRUNKEN RIBALD GAIETY AMONG THE CROWD THAT MADE THEM ALL AKIN
LJ016-0284 THERE WERE PREACHERS AMONG THE CROWD BUT THEY COULD NOT GET A PATIENT HEARING
LJ016-0285 THEN ONE STRUCK UP THE HYMN OF THE PROMISED LAND AND THE REFRAIN WAS AT ONCE TAKEN UP WITH A MIGHTY CHORUS 
LJ016-0286 OH MY THINK I'VE GOT TO DIE
LJ016-0287 THIS WAS PRESENTLY SUPERSEDED BY A FRESH CATCH 
LJ016-0288 MÜLLER MÜLLER HE'S THE MAN TILL A DIVERSION WAS CREATED BY THE APPEARANCE OF THE GALLOWS WHICH WAS RECEIVED WITH CONTINUOUS YELLS
LJ016-0289 AS DAY BROKE THE CHARACTER OF THE CROWD WAS BETRAYED
LJ016-0290 THERE WERE BUT FEW WOMEN EXCEPT OF THE MOST DEGRADED SORT THE MEN WERE MOSTLY YOUNG MEN 
LJ016-0291 SHARPERS THIEVES GAMBLERS BETTING MEN THE OUTSIDERS OF THE BOXING RING
LJ016-0292 BRICKLAYERS' LABORERS DOCK WORKMEN GERMAN ARTISANS AND SUGARBAKERS
LJ016-0293 WITH THE RAKINGS OF CHEAP SINGINGHALLS AND BILLIARDROOMS THE FAST YOUNG MEN OF LONDON
LJ016-0294 BUT ALL WHETHER YOUNG OR OLD MEN OR WOMEN SEEMED TO KNOW NOTHING FEEL NOTHING TO HAVE NO OBJECT BUT THE GALLOWS AND TO LAUGH
LJ016-0295 CURSE OR SHOUT AS IN THIS HEAVING AND STRUGGLING FORWARD THEY GAINED OR LOST IN THEIR STRONG EFFORTS TO GET NEARER WHERE MÜLLER WAS TO DIE
LJ016-0296 THE ACTUAL EXECUTION MADE SOME IMPRESSION
LJ016-0297 THE CROWD WAS FOR A MOMENT AWED AND STILLED BY THE QUIET RAPID PASSAGE FROM LIFE TO DEATH
LJ016-0298 BUT BEFORE THE SLIGHT SLOW VIBRATIONS OF THE BODY HAD WELL ENDED
LJ016-0299 ROBBERY AND VIOLENCE LOUD LAUGHING OATHS FIGHTING OBSCENE CONDUCT AND STILL MORE FILTHY LANGUAGE REIGNED ROUND THE GALLOWS FAR AND NEAR
LJ016-0300 SUCH TOO THE SCENE REMAINED WITH LITTLE CHANGE OR RESPITE TILL THE OLD HANGMAN CALCRAFT SLUNK AGAIN ALONG THE DROP
LJ016-0301 AMID HISSES AND SNEERING INQUIRIES OF WHAT HE HAD HAD TO DRINK THAT MORNING
LJ016-0302 HE AFTER FAILING ONCE TO CUT THE ROPE MADE A SECOND ATTEMPT MORE SUCCESSFULLY AND THE BODY OF MÜLLER DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW
LJ016-0303 IT WAS PREPOSTEROUS TO CLAIM FOR SUCH A SCENE AS THIS THAT IT CONVEYED ANY GREAT MORAL LESSON OR HAD ANY DETERRING INFLUENCE
LJ016-0304 NUMBERS OF HUMANE AND THOUGHTFUL PERSONS HAD LONG BEEN CONVINCED OF THIS
LJ016-0305 ALREADY THE URGENT NECESSITY FOR ABOLISHING PUBLIC EXECUTIONS HAD BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE HOUSE OF COMMONS BY MR. HIBBERT
LJ016-0306 AND THE QUESTION AS PART OF THE WHOLE SUBJECT OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT HAD BEEN REFERRED TO A ROYAL COMMISSION IN JANUARY 1864
LJ016-0307 FULL EVIDENCE WAS TAKEN ON ALL POINTS AND ON THAT REGARDING PUBLIC EXECUTIONS THERE WAS A GREAT PREPONDERANCE OF OPINION TOWARDS THEIR ABOLITION
LJ016-0308 YET THE WITNESSES WERE NOT UNANIMOUS
LJ016-0309 SOME OF THE JUDGES WOULD HAVE RETAINED THE PUBLIC SPECTACLE THE ORDINARY OF NEWGATE WAS NOT CERTAIN THAT PUBLIC EXECUTIONS WERE NOT THE BEST
LJ016-0310 ANOTHER DISTINGUISHED WITNESS FEARED
LJ016-0311 THAT ANY SECRECY IN THE TREATMENT OF THE CONDEMNED WOULD INVEST THEM WITH A NEW AND GREATER INTEREST WHICH WAS MUCH TO BE DEPRECATED
LJ016-0312 FOREIGN WITNESSES TOO WERE IN FAVOR OF PUBLICITY
LJ016-0313 ON THE OTHER HAND LORDS CRANWORTH AND WENSLEYDALE RECOMMENDED PRIVATE EXECUTIONS SO DID MR. SPENCER WALPOLE M.P.
LJ016-0314 SIR GEORGE GREY THOUGHT THERE WAS A GROWING FEELING IN FAVOR OF EXECUTIONS WITHIN THE PRISON PRECINCTS
LJ016-0315 COLONEL NOW SIR EDMUND HENDERSON WAS STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF THEM
LJ016-0316 BASED ON HIS EXPERIENCE OF THEM IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA HE NOT ONLY THOUGHT THEM LIKELY TO BE MORE DETERRENT
LJ016-0317 BUT BELIEVED THAT A PUBLIC CEREMONY DESTROYED THE WHOLE VALUE OF AN EXECUTION
LJ016-0318 OTHER OFFICIALS GREAT LAWYERS GOVERNORS OF PRISONS AND CHAPLAINS SUPPORTED THIS VIEW
LJ016-0319 THE ONLY DOUBTS EXPRESSED WERE AS TO THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE SAFEGUARDS AS TO THE CERTAINTY OF DEATH AND ITS SUBSEQUENT PUBLICATION
LJ016-0320 BUT THESE IT WAS THOUGHT MIGHT BE PROVIDED BY THE ADMISSION OF THE PRESS AND THE HOLDING OF A CORONER'S INQUEST
LJ016-0321 DULY IMPRESSED WITH THE WEIGHT OF EVIDENCE IN FAVOR OF ABOLITION
LJ016-0322 THE COMMISSION RECOMMENDED THAT DEATH SENTENCES SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT WITHIN THE JAIL UNDER SUCH REGULATIONS AS MIGHT BE CONSIDERED NECESSARY
LJ016-0323 TO PREVENT ABUSE AND SATISFY THE PUBLIC THAT THE LAW HAD BEEN COMPLIED WITH
LJ016-0324 BUT IT IS CURIOUS TO NOTE THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL DISSENTIENTS AMONG THE COMMISSIONERS TO THIS PARAGRAPH OF THE REPORT
LJ016-0325 THE JUDGE OF THE ADMIRALTY COURT THE RIGHT HON. STEPHEN LUSHINGTON THE RIGHT HON. JAMES MONCRIEFF
LJ016-0326 LORD ADVOCATE MR. CHARLES NEATE MR. WILLIAM EWART AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST MR. JOHN BRIGHT
LJ016-0327 DECLARED THAT THEY WERE NOT PREPARED TO AGREE TO THE RESOLUTION RESPECTING PRIVATE EXECUTIONS
LJ016-0328 NEVERTHELESS IN THE VERY NEXT SESSION
LJ016-0329 A BILL WAS INTRODUCED BY MR. HIBBERT M.P. AND ACCEPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDING FOR THE FUTURE CARRYING OUT OF EXECUTIONS WITHIN PRISONS
LJ016-0330 IT WAS READ FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MARCH 1866 BUT DID NOT BECOME LAW TILL EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT
LJ016-0331 THE LAST PUBLIC EXECUTION IN FRONT OF NEWGATE WAS THAT OF THE FENIAN MICHAEL BARRETT
LJ016-0332 WHO WAS CONVICTED OF COMPLICITY IN THE CLERKENWELL EXPLOSION INTENDED TO EFFECT THE RELEASE OF BURKE AND CASEY
LJ016-0333 FROM CLERKENWELL PRISON BY WHICH MANY PERSONS LOST THEIR LIVES
LJ016-0334 UNUSUAL PRECAUTIONS WERE TAKEN UPON THIS OCCASION AS SOME FRESH OUTRAGE WAS APPREHENDED
LJ016-0335 THERE WAS NO INTERFERENCE WITH THE CROWD WHICH COLLECTED AS USUAL ALTHOUGH NOT TO THE CUSTOMARY EXTENT
LJ016-0336 BUT NEWGATE AND ITS NEIGHBORHOOD WAS CAREFULLY HELD BY THE POLICE BOTH CITY AND METROPOLITAN
LJ016-0337 IN THE HOUSES OPPOSITE THE PRISON NUMBERS OF DETECTIVES MIXED WITH THE SPECTATORS
LJ016-0338 INSIDE THE JAIL WAS COLONEL FRAZER THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER OF THE CITY POLICE AND AT NO GREAT DISTANCE ALTHOUGH IN THE BACKGROUND
LJ016-0339 TROOPS WERE HELD IN READINESS TO ACT IF REQUIRED. EVERYTHING PASSED OFF QUITE QUIETLY HOWEVER
LJ016-0340 AND CALCRAFT WHO HAD BEEN THREATENED WITH SUMMARY RETRIBUTION IF HE EXECUTED BARRETT CARRIED OUT THE SENTENCE WITHOUT MISHAP
LJ016-0341 THE SUFFERER WAS STOLID AND RETICENT TO THE LAST
LJ016-0342 THE FIRST PRIVATE EXECUTION UNDER THE NEW LAW TOOK PLACE WITHIN THE PRECINCTS OF MAIDSTONE JAIL
LJ016-0343 THE SUFFERER WAS A PORTER ON THE LONDON CHATHAM AND DOVER RAILWAY SENTENCED TO DEATH FOR SHOOTING THE STATIONMASTER AT DOVER
LJ016-0344 THE CEREMONY WHICH WAS WITNESSED BY ONLY A FEW OFFICIALS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PRESS WAS PERFORMED WITH THE UTMOST DECENCY AND DECORUM
LJ016-0346 A FACT DULY ADVERTISED AS COMPLETED BY THE HOISTING OF THE BLACK FLAG OVER THE JAIL
LJ016-0347 HAD UNDOUBTEDLY A SOLEMN IMPRESSIVE EFFECT UPON THOSE OUTSIDE
LJ016-0348 THE SAME WAS REALIZED IN THE FIRST PRIVATE EXECUTION WITHIN NEWGATE
LJ016-0349 THAT OF ALEXANDER MACKAY WHO MURDERED HIS MISTRESS AT NORTON FOLGATE BY BEATING HER WITH A ROLLINGPIN AND FURNACERAKE
LJ016-0350 AND WHO EXPIATED HIS CRIME ON THE 8TH SEPTEMBER EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT
LJ016-0351 A MORE MARKED CHANGE FROM THE OLD SCENE CAN HARDLY BE CONCEIVED INSTEAD OF THE ROAR OF THE BRUTALIZED CROWD
LJ016-0352 THE OFFICIALS SPOKE IN WHISPERS THERE WAS BUT LITTLE MOVING TO AND FRO
LJ016-0353 ALMOST ABSOLUTE SILENCE PREVAILED UNTIL THE GREAT BELL BEGAN TO TOLL ITS DEEP NOTE AND BROKE THE STILLNESS WITH ITS REGULAR AND MONOTONOUS CLANGOUR
LJ016-0354 AND THE ORDINARY IN A VOICE TREMBLING WITH EMOTION READ THE BURIAL SERVICE ALOUD
LJ016-0355 MACKAY'S FORTITUDE WHICH HAD BEEN GREAT
LJ016-0356 BROKE DOWN AT THE SUPREME MOMENT BEFORE THE HORROR OF THE STILLNESS THE AWFUL IMPRESSIVENESS OF THE SCENE IN WHICH HE WAS THE PRINCIPAL ACTOR
LJ016-0357 NO TIME WAS LOST IN CARRYING OUT THE DREAD CEREMONY BUT IT WAS NOT COMPLETED WITHOUT SOME OF THE OFFICIALS TURNING SICK AND THE MOMENT IT WAS OVER
LJ016-0358 ALL WHO COULD WERE GLAD TO ESCAPE FROM THE LAST ACT OF THE GHASTLY DRAMA AT WHICH THEY HAD ASSISTED
LJ016-0359 PRIVATE EXECUTIONS AT THEIR FIRST INTRODUCTION WERE NOT POPULAR WITH THE NEWGATE OFFICIALS AND FOR INTELLIGIBLE REASONS
LJ016-0360 THE CHANGE ADDED GREATLY TO THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE GOVERNOR AND HIS SUBORDINATES. HITHERTO THE PUBLIC HAD SEEMED TO ASSIST AT THE CEREMONY
LJ016-0361 THE MOMENT TOO THAT THE CONDEMNED MAN HAD PASSED THROUGH THE DEBTORS' DOOR ON TO THE SCAFFOLD THE PRISON HAD DONE WITH HIM
LJ016-0362 AND THE GREAT OUTSIDE WORLD SHARED IN THE COMPLETION OF THE SACRIFICE
LJ016-0363 THIS FEELING WAS THE STRONGER BECAUSE
LJ016-0364 ALL THE GHASTLY PARAPHERNALIA THE GALLOWS ITSELF AND THE PROCESS OF ERECTING AND REMOVING IT RESTED WITH THE CITY ARCHITECT AND NOT WITH THE PRISON OFFICIALS
LJ016-0365 MOREOVER AFTER THE EXECUTION UNDER THE OLD SYSTEM THE LATTER HAD ONLY TO RECEIVE THE BODY FOR BURIAL AFTER IT HAD BEEN CUT DOWN BY THE HANGMAN
LJ016-0366 AND PLACED DECENTLY IN A SHELL BY THE WORKMEN WHO REMOVED THE GALLOWS
LJ016-0367 UNDER THE NEW SYSTEM THE WHOLE OF THE ARRANGEMENTS FROM FIRST TO LAST FELL UPON THE OFFICERS
LJ016-0368 IT WAS THEY WHO FORMED THE CHIEF PART OF THE SMALL SELECT GROUP OF SPECTATORS
LJ016-0369 UPON THEM DEVOLVED THE PAINFUL DUTY OF CUTTING DOWN THE BODY AND PREPARING FOR THE INQUEST
LJ016-0370 ALL THAT THE HANGMAN WHOEVER HE MAY BE DOES UNDER THE NEW REGIME IS TO UNHOOK THE HALTER AND REMOVE THE PINIONING STRAPS
LJ016-0371 THE INTERMENT IN A SHELL FILLED WITH QUICKLIME IN THE PASSAGEWAY LEADING TO THE OLD BAILEY IS ALSO A PART OF THE DUTY OF THE PRISON OFFICIALS
LJ016-0373 AND FOR THE GREATER SECURITY OF PRISONERS IT IS ROOFED IN WITH IRON BARS WHICH GIVES IT AT LEAST OVERHEAD THE ASPECT OF A HUGE CAGE
LJ016-0374 UNDERFOOT AND UPON THE WALLS ROUGHLY CUT INTO THE STONES ARE SINGLE INITIAL LETTERS THE BRIEF EPITAPHS OF THOSE WHO LIE BELOW
LJ016-0375 AS THIS BURIALGROUND LEADS TO THE ADJACENT CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT ACCUSED MURDERERS ON GOING TO AND RETURNING FROM TRIAL
LJ016-0376 LITERALLY WALKED OVER WHAT IN CASE OF CONVICTION WOULD BE THEIR OWN GRAVES
LJ016-0377 THE OLDER OFFICERS WITH SEVERAL OF WHOM I HAVE CONVERSED HAVE THUS HAD UNUSUAL OPPORTUNITIES OF WATCHING THE DEMEANOR OF MURDERERS BOTH BEFORE TRIAL
LJ016-0378 AND AFTER SENTENCE
LJ016-0379 ALL AS A RULE UNLESS POIGNANT REMORSE HAS BROUGHT A DESIRE TO COURT THEIR RICHLYMERITED RETRIBUTION ARE BUOYED UP
LJ016-0380 WITH HOPE TO THE LAST THERE IS ALWAYS THE CHANCE OF A FLAW IN THE INDICTMENT OF A MISSING WITNESS OR EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES
LJ016-0381 EVEN WHEN IN THE CONDEMNED CELL WITH A SHAMEFUL DEATH WITHIN MEASURABLE DISTANCE
LJ016-0382 MANY CLING STILL TO LIFE EXPECTING MUCH FROM THE INTERCESSION OF FRIENDS OR THE HUMANITARIANISM OF THE AGE
LJ016-0383 ALL ALMOST WITHOUT EXCEPTION SLEEP SOUNDLY AT NIGHT EXCEPT THE FIRST AFTER SENTENCE
LJ016-0384 WHEN THE FIRST SHOCK OF THE VERDICT AND THE SOLEMN NOTIFICATION OF THE IMPENDING BLOW KEEPS NEARLY ALL AWAKE OR AT LEAST DISTURBS THEIR NIGHT'S REST
LJ016-0385 BUT THE UNEASINESS SOON WEARS OFF. THE SECOND NIGHT SLEEP COMES READILY AND IS SOUND
LJ016-0386 MANY OF THE MOST ABANDONED MURDERERS SNORE PEACEFULLY THEIR EIGHT HOURS EVEN ON THE NIGHT IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING EXECUTION
LJ016-0387 ALL TOO HAVE A FAIRLY GOOD APPETITE AND EAT WITH RELISH UP TO THE LAST MOMENT
LJ016-0388 A FEW GO FURTHER AND ARE ALMOST GLUTTONOUS
LJ016-0389 GIOVANNI LANNI THE ITALIAN BOY WHO MURDERED A FRENCHWOMAN IN THE HAYMARKET
LJ016-0390 AND WAS ARRESTED ON BOARD SHIP JUST AS HE WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY HAD A LITTLE SPARE CASH WHICH HE DEVOTED ENTIRELY TO THE PURCHASE OF EXTRA FOOD
LJ016-0391 HE ATE CONSTANTLY AND VORACIOUSLY AFTER SENTENCE AS THOUGH EAGER TO CRAM AS MANY MEALS AS POSSIBLE INTO THE FEW HOURS STILL LEFT HIM TO LIVE
LJ016-0392 JEFFREY WHO MURDERED HIS OWN CHILD AN INFANT OF SIX BY HANGING HIM IN A CELLAR IN SEVEN DIALS
LJ016-0393 CALLED FOR A ROAST DUCK DIRECTLY HE ENTERED THE CONDEMNED CELL
LJ016-0394 THE REQUEST WAS NOT GRANTED AS THE OLD CUSTOM OF ALLOWING CAPITAL CONVICTS WHATEVER THEY ASKED FOR IN THE WAY OF FOOD HAS NOT BEEN THE RULE IN NEWGATE
LJ016-0395 THE DIET OF THE CONDEMNED IS THE ORDINARY DIET OF THE PRISON
LJ016-0396 BUT TO WHICH ADDITIONS ARE SOMETIMES MADE CHIEFLY OF STIMULANTS IF DEEMED NECESSARY BY THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF THE JAIL
LJ016-0397 THE CRAVING FOR TOBACCO WHICH SO DOMINATES THE HABITUAL SMOKER OFTEN LEADS THE CONVICTED TO PLEAD HARD FOR A LAST SMOKE
LJ016-0398 AS A SPECIAL FAVOR
LJ016-0399 WAINWRIGHT WAS ALLOWED A CIGAR THE NIGHT BEFORE EXECUTION WHICH HE SMOKED IN THE PRISON YARD WALKING UP AND DOWN WITH THE GOVERNOR MR. SYDNEY SMITH
LJ016-0400 WAINWRIGHT'S DEMEANOR WAS ONE OF RECKLESS EFFRONTERY STEADILY MAINTAINED TO THE LAST
LJ016-0401 HIS CONVERSATION TURNED ALWAYS UPON HIS INFLUENCE OVER THE WEAKER SEX AND THE EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESS HE HAD ACHIEVED
LJ016-0402 NO WOMAN COULD RESIST HIM HE CALMLY ASSURED MR. SMITH THAT NIGHT AS THEY WALKED TOGETHER AND HE RECOUNTED HIS VILLANIES ONE BY ONE
LJ016-0403 HIS EFFRONTERY WAS ONLY OUTDONE BY HIS COOL CONTEMPT FOR THE CONSOLATIONS OF RELIGION
LJ016-0404 THE MAN WHO HAD MADE A PIOUS LIFE A CLOAK FOR HIS MISDEEDS THE ONCE EXEMPLARY YOUNG MAN AND INDEFATIGABLE SUNDAY SCHOOL TEACHER
LJ016-0405 WENT IMPENITENT TO THE GALLOWS. THE ONLY SIGN OF FEELING HE SHOWED WAS IN ASKING TO BE ALLOWED TO CHOOSE THE HYMNS ON THE SUNDAY
LJ016-0406 THE CONDEMNED SERMON WAS PREACHED IN THE PRISON CHAPEL AND THIS WAS PROBABLY ONLY THAT HE MIGHT HEAR THE SINGING OF A LADY WITH A MAGNIFICENT VOICE
LJ016-0407 WHO GENERALLY ATTENDED THE PRISON SERVICES
LJ016-0408 DURING THE SINGING OF THESE HYMNS WAINWRIGHT FAINTED BUT WHETHER FROM REAL EMOTION OR THE DESIRE TO MAKE A SENSATION WAS NEVER EXACTLY KNOWN
LJ016-0409 ON THE FATAL MORNING HE CAME GAILY OUT OF HIS CELL
LJ016-0410 NODDED PLEASANTLY TO THE GOVERNOR WHO STOOD JUST OPPOSITE AND THEN WALKED BRISKLY TOWARDS THE EXECUTION SHED SMILING AS HE WENT ALONG
LJ016-0411 THERE WAS A SMILE ON HIS FACE WHEN IT WAS LAST SEEN AND JUST AS THE TERRIBLE WHITE CAP WAS DRAWN OVER IT
LJ016-0412 WAINWRIGHT'S EXECUTION WAS WITHIN THE JAIL BUT ONLY NOMINALLY PRIVATE
LJ016-0413 NO LESS THAN SIXTYSEVEN PERSONS WERE PRESENT ADMITTED BY SPECIAL PERMISSION OF THE SHERIFF
LJ016-0414 RUMOUR EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO ASSERT THAT AMONG THE SPECTATORS WERE SEVERAL WOMEN DISGUISED IN MALE HABILIMENTS
LJ016-0415 BUT THE STORY WAS NEVER SUBSTANTIATED AND WE MAY HOPE THAT IT RESTED ONLY ON THE IDLE GOSSIP OF THE DAY
LJ016-0416 MANY LIKE WAINWRIGHT WERE CALM AND IMPERTURBABLE THROUGHOUT THEIR TRYING ORDEAL
LJ016-0417 CATHERINE WILSON THE POISONER WAS RESERVED AND RETICENT TO THE LAST EXPRESSING NO CONTRITION BUT ALSO NO FEAR 
LJ016-0418 A TALL GAUNT REPULSIVELOOKING WOMAN WHO NO MORE SHRANK FROM COWARDLY SECRET CRIMES THAN FROM THE PENALTY THEY ENTAILED
LJ016-0419 KATE WEBSTER WHO WAS TRIED AT THE CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT AND PASSED THROUGH NEWGATE ALTHOUGH SHE SUFFERED AT WANDSWORTH
LJ016-0420 IS REMEMBERED AT THE FORMER PRISON AS A DEFIANT
LJ016-0421 BRUTAL CREATURE WHO SHOWED NO REMORSE BUT WAS SUBJECT TO FITS OF UNGOVERNABLE PASSION WHEN SHE BROKE OUT INTO LANGUAGE THE MOST APPALLING
LJ016-0422 THE MAN MARLEY DISPLAYED FORTITUDE OF A LESS REPULSIVE KIND. HE ACKNOWLEDGED HIS GUILT FROM THE FIRST
LJ016-0423 WHEN THE SHERIFF OFFERED HIM COUNSEL FOR HIS DEFENSE HE DECLINED SAYING HE WISHED TO MAKE NONE  THE WITNESSES FOR THE PROSECUTION SPOKE THE TRUTH
LJ016-0424 DURING THE TRIAL AND AFTER SENTENCE HE REMAINED PERFECTLY COOL AND COLLECTED
LJ016-0425 WHEN VISITED ONE DAY IN THE CONDEMNED CELL JUST AS ST. SEPULCHRE'S CLOCK WAS STRIKING HE LOOKED UP AND SAID LAUGHINGLY GO ALONG CLOCK
LJ016-0426 COME ALONG GALLOWS
LJ016-0427 HE TRIPPED UP THE CHAPELSTAIRS TO HEAR THE CONDEMNED SERMON AND CAME OUT WITH CHEERFUL ALACRITY ON THE MORNING HE WAS TO DIE
LJ016-0428 SOME CONDEMNED CONVICTS CONVERSE BUT LITTLE WITH THE WARDERS WHO HAVE THEM UNCEASINGLY IN CHARGE
LJ016-0429 OTHERS TALK FREELY ENOUGH ON VARIOUS TOPICS BUT PRINCIPALLY UPON THEIR OWN CASES
LJ016-0430 WHEN VANITY IS STRONGLY DEVELOPED THERE IS THE KEEN ANXIETY TO HEAR WHAT IS BEING SAID ABOUT THEM OUTSIDE
LJ016-0431 ONE WAS VEXED TO THINK THAT HIS VICTIMS HAD A FINER FUNERAL THAN HE WOULD HAVE
LJ016-0432 THE ONLY SUBJECT ANOTHER SHOWED ANY INTEREST IN WAS THE THEATRES AND THE NEW PIECES THAT WERE BEING PRODUCED A THIRD CHRISTIAN SATLER
LJ016-0433 LAUGHED AND JESTED WITH THE OFFICERS ABOUT JACK KETCH WHO THROUGH THE POSTPONEMENT OF THE EXECUTION WOULD LOSE HIS CHRISTMAS DINNER
LJ016-0434 WHEN THEY BROUGHT IN THE TWO WATCHERS TO RELIEVE GUARD ONE NIGHT SATTLER SAID
LJ016-0435 TWO FRESH MEN MAY I SPEAK TO THEM YES I MUST CAUTION YOU HE WENT ON TO THE WARDERS NOT TO GO TO SLEEP OR I SHALL BE OFF THROUGH THAT LITTLE HOLE
LJ016-0436 POINTING TO AN APERTURE FOR VENTILATING THE CELL ON THE MORNING OF EXECUTION HE ASKED HOW FAR IT WAS TO THE GALLOWS AND WAS TOLD IT WAS QUITE CLOSE
LJ016-0438 THAT THE CONVICT'S CLOTHES WERE STILL THE EXECUTIONER'S PERQUISITE
LJ016-0439 OFTEN THE CONVICTS GIVE WAY TO DESPAIR. THEY ARE TOO CLOSELY WATCHED TO BE ALLOWED TO DO THEMSELVES MUCH MISCHIEF OR SUICIDES WOULD PROBABLY BE MORE FREQUENT
LJ016-0440 BUT IT IS NEITHER EASY TO OBTAIN THE INSTRUMENTS OF SELFDESTRUCTION NOR TO ELUDE THE VIGILANCE OF THEIR GUARD
LJ016-0441 THE MAN BOUSFIELD HOWEVER WHOSE EXECUTION WAS SO SADLY BUNGLED
LJ016-0442 MADE A DETERMINED EFFORT TO BURN HIMSELF TO DEATH BY THROWING HIMSELF BODILY ON TO THE FIRE IN THE CONDEMNED WARD
LJ016-0443 HE WAS PROMPTLY RESCUED FROM HIS PERILOUS CONDITION BUT NOT BEFORE HIS FACE AND HANDS WERE BADLY SCORCHED
LJ016-0444 THEY WERE STILL MUCH SWOLLEN WHEN HE WAS LED OUT TO EXECUTION
LJ016-0445 MILLER THE CHELSEA MURDERER WHO PACKED HIS VICTIM'S BODY IN A BOX AND TRIED TO SEND IT BY PARCELS DELIVERY TRIED TO KILL HIMSELF
LJ016-0446 BUT INEFFECTIVELY BY RUNNING HIS HEAD AGAINST HIS CELL WALL
LJ017-0001 THE CHRONICLES OF NEWGATE VOLUME TWO BY ARTHUR GRIFFITHS SECTION TWENTY NEWGATE NOTORIETIES PART ONE
LJ017-0002 AS THESE RECORDS DRAW TO A CLOSE THE CRIMES I CHRONICLE BECOME SO MUCH MORE RECENT IN DATE THAT THEY WILL BE FRESH IN THE MEMORY OF MOST OF MY READERS
LJ017-0003 NEVERTHELESS IN ORDER TO GIVE COMPLETENESS TO THE PICTURE
LJ017-0004 I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO DRAW OF CRIME IN CONNECTION WITH NEWGATE FROM FIRST TO LAST I MUST MAKE SOME MENTION IN THIS MY PENULTIMATE CHAPTER
LJ017-0005 OF SOME OF THE MOST HEINOUS OFFENSES OF MODERN TIMES
LJ017-0006 THE CRIME OF POISONING HAS ALWAYS BEEN VIEWED WITH PECULIAR LOATHING AND TERROR IN THIS COUNTRY
LJ017-0007 IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT AS FAR BACK AS THE REIGN OF HENRY VIII. A NEW AND MOST CRUEL PENALTY WAS DEVISED FOR THE PUNISHMENT OF THE BISHOP OF ROCHESTER'S COOK
LJ017-0008 WHO HAD POISONED HIS MASTER AND MANY OF HIS DEPENDENTS
LJ017-0009 SIR THOMAS OVERBURY WAS UNDOUBTEDLY POISONED BY LORD ROCHESTER IN THE REIGN OF JAMES I
LJ017-0010 AND IT IS HINTED THAT JAMES HIMSELF NEARLY FELL A VICTIM TO A NEFARIOUS ATTEMPT OF THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM
LJ017-0011 BUT SECRET POISONING ON A WHOLESALE SCALE SUCH AS WAS PRACTICED IN ITALY AND FRANCE WAS HAPPILY NEVER POPULARIZED IN ENGLAND
LJ017-0012 THE WELLKNOWN AND LETHAL AQUA TOFFANIA
LJ017-0013 SO CALLED AFTER ITS INVENTRESS A ROMAN WOMAN NAMED TOFFANA AND WHICH WAS SO WIDELY ADOPTED BY LADIES ANXIOUS TO GET RID OF THEIR HUSBANDS
LJ017-0014 WAS NEVER INTRODUCED INTO THIS COUNTRY. ITS ADMISSION WAS PROBABLY CHECKED BY THE INCREASED VIGILANCE AT THE CUSTOM HOUSES
LJ017-0015 THE NECESSITY FOR WHICH WAS URGED BY MR. ADDISON WHEN SECRETARY OF STATE IN 1717
LJ017-0016 THE CASES OF POISONING IN THE BRITISH CALENDARS ARE RARE NOR INDEED WAS THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED ALWAYS CLEARLY ESTABLISHED
LJ017-0017 IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT CATHERINE BLANDY WHO POISONED HER FATHER AT THE INSTIGATION OF HER LOVER
LJ017-0018 WAS IGNORANT OF THE DESTRUCTIVE CHARACTER OF THE POWDERS PROBABLY ARSENIC WHICH SHE ADMINISTERED
LJ017-0019 CAPTAIN DONELLAN WHO WAS CONVICTED OF POISONING HIS BROTHERINLAW SIR THEODOSIUS BROUGHTON AND EXECUTED FOR IT
LJ017-0020 WOULD PROBABLY HAVE HAD THE BENEFIT IN THESE DAYS OF THE DOUBTS RAISED AT HIS TRIAL
LJ017-0021 A THIRD CASE MORE ESPECIALLY INTERESTING TO US AS HAVING PASSED THROUGH NEWGATE
LJ017-0022 WAS THAT OF ELIZA FENNING WHO WAS CONVICTED OF AN ATTEMPT TO POISON A WHOLE FAMILY
LJ017-0023 BY PUTTING ARSENIC IN THE DUMPLINGS SHE HAD PREPARED FOR THEM. THE CHARGE RESTED ENTIRELY ON CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE
LJ017-0024 AND AS FENNING ALTHOUGH CONVICTED AND EXECUTED PROTESTED HER INNOCENCE IN THE MOST SOLEMN MANNER TO THE LAST
LJ017-0025 THE JUSTICE OF THE SENTENCE WAS DOUBTED AT THE TIME
LJ017-0026 YET IT WAS CLEARLY PROVED THAT THE DUMPLINGS CONTAINED ARSENIC THAT SHE AND SHE ALONE HAD MADE THE DOUGH
LJ017-0027 THAT ARSENIC WAS WITHIN HER REACH IN THE HOUSE
LJ017-0028 THAT SHE HAD HAD A QUARREL WITH HER MISTRESS AND THAT THE LATTER WITH ALL OTHERS WHO TASTED THE DUMPLINGS WERE SIMILARLY ATTACKED ALTHOUGH NO ONE DIED
LJ017-0029 THE CRIME OF POISONING IS ESSENTIALLY ONE WHICH WILL BE MOST PREVALENT IN A HIGH STATE OF CIVILIZATION
LJ017-0030 WHEN THE SPREAD OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE PLACES NEFARIOUS MEANS AT THE DISPOSAL OF MANY
LJ017-0031 INSTEAD OF LIMITING THEM AS IN THE DAYS OF THE BORGIAS AND BRINVILLIERS TO THE SPECIALLY INFORMED AND UNSCRUPULOUSLY POWERFUL FEW
LJ017-0032 THE FIRST INTIMATION CONVEYED TO SOCIETY OF THE NEW TERROR WHICH THREATENED IT WAS IN THE ARREST AND ARRAIGNMENT OF WILLIAM PALMER
LJ017-0033 A MEDICAL PRACTITIONER CHARGED WITH DOING TO DEATH PERSONS WHO RELIED UPON HIS PROFESSIONAL SKILL
LJ017-0034 THE CASE CONTAINED ELEMENTS OF MUCH UNCERTAINTY AND YET IT WAS SO ESSENTIAL
LJ017-0035 IN THE INTERESTS AND FOR THE DUE PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC THAT THE FULLEST AND FAIREST INQUIRY SHOULD BE MADE
LJ017-0036 THAT THE TRIAL WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT
LJ017-0037 UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF AN ACT PASSED ON PURPOSE KNOWN AS THE TRIAL OF OFFENSES ACT AND SOMETIMES AS LORD CAMPBELL'S ACT
LJ017-0038 THAT THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE SHOULD NEVER BE INTERFERED WITH BY LOCAL PREJUDICE OR LOCAL FEELING
LJ017-0039 IS OBVIOUSLY OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE AND THE POWERS GRANTED BY THIS ACT HAVE BEEN FREQUENTLY PUT IN PRACTICE SINCE
LJ017-0040 THE TRIAL OF CATHERINE WINSOR THE BABY FARMER
LJ017-0041 WAS THUS BROUGHT TO THE CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT FROM EXETER ASSIZES AND THAT OF THE STAUNTONS FROM MAIDSTONE
LJ017-0042 PALMER'S TRIAL CAUSED THE MOST INTENSE EXCITEMENT
LJ017-0043 THE DIREFUL SUSPICIONS WHICH SURROUNDED THE CASE FILLED THE WHOLE COUNTRY WITH UNEASINESS AND MISGIVING
LJ017-0044 AND THE DEEPEST ANXIETY WAS FELT THAT THE CRIME IF CRIME THERE HAD BEEN SHOULD BE BROUGHT HOME TO ITS PERPETRATOR
LJ017-0045 THE CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT WAS CROWDED TO SUFFOCATION
LJ017-0046 GREAT PERSONAGES OCCUPIED SEATS UPON THE BENCH
LJ017-0047 THE REST OF THE AVAILABLE SPACE WAS ALLOTTED BY TICKET TO SECURE WHICH THE GREATEST INFLUENCE WAS NECESSARY
LJ017-0048 PEOPLE CAME TO STARE AT THE SUPPOSED COLDBLOODED PRISONER
LJ017-0049 WITH MORBID CURIOSITY TO SCAN HIS FEATURES AND WATCH HIS DEMEANOR THROUGH THE SHIFTING NICELYBALANCED PHASES OF HIS PROTRACTED TRIAL
LJ017-0050 PALMER WHO WAS ONLY THIRTYONE AT THE TIME OF HIS TRIAL WAS IN APPEARANCE SHORT AND STOUT WITH A ROUND HEAD
LJ017-0051 COVERED RATHER SCANTILY WITH LIGHT SANDY HAIR
LJ017-0052 HIS SKIN WAS EXTRAORDINARILY FAIR HIS CHEEKS FRESH AND RUDDY ALTOGETHER HIS FACE THOUGH COMMONPLACE WAS NOT EXACTLY UGLY
LJ017-0053 THERE WAS CERTAINLY NOTHING IN IT WHICH INDICATED CRUEL CUNNING OR DELIBERATE TRUCULENCE
LJ017-0054 HIS FEATURES WERE NOT CAREWORN BUT RATHER SET AND HE LOOKED OLDER THAN HIS AGE
LJ017-0055 THROUGHOUT HIS TRIAL HE PRESERVED AN IMPASSIVE COUNTENANCE BUT HE CLEARLY TOOK A DEEP INTEREST IN ALL THAT PASSED
LJ017-0056 ALTHOUGH THE STRAIN LASTED FOURTEEN DAYS HE SHOWED NO SIGNS OF EXHAUSTION EITHER PHYSICAL OR MENTAL
LJ017-0057 ON RETURNING TO JAIL EACH DAY HE TALKED FREELY AND WITHOUT RESERVE TO THE WARDERS IN CHARGE OF HIM CHIEFLY ON INCIDENTS IN THE DAY'S PROCEEDINGS
LJ017-0058 HE WAS CONFIDENT TO THE VERY LAST THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND HIM GUILTY
LJ017-0059 EVEN AFTER SENTENCE AND UNTIL WITHIN A FEW HOURS OF EXECUTION HE WAS BUOYED UP WITH THE HOPE OF REPRIEVE
LJ017-0060 THE CONVICTION THAT HE WOULD ESCAPE HAD TAKEN SO FIRM A HOLD OF HIM
LJ017-0061 THAT HE STEADILY REFUSED TO CONFESS HIS GUILT LEST IT SHOULD MILITATE AGAINST HIS CHANCES
LJ017-0062 IN THE CONDEMNED CELL HE FREQUENTLY REPEATED QUOTE I GO TO MY DEATH A MURDERED MAN END QUOTE
LJ017-0063 HE MADE NO DISTINCT ADMISSIONS EVEN ON THE SCAFFOLD BUT WHEN THE CHAPLAIN AT THE LAST MOMENT EXHORTED HIM TO CONFESS
LJ017-0064 HE MADE USE OF THE REMARKABLE WORDS QUOTE IF IT IS NECESSARY FOR MY SOUL'S SAKE TO CONFESS THIS MURDER
LJ017-0065 I OUGHT ALSO TO CONFESS THE OTHERS I MEAN MY WIFE AND MY BROTHER'S. END QUOTE
LJ017-0066 YET HE WAS SILENT WHEN SPECIFICALLY PRESSED TO CONFESS THAT HE HAD KILLED HIS WIFE AND HIS BROTHER
LJ017-0067 PALMER WAS ABLY DEFENDED BUT THE WEIGHT OF EVIDENCE WAS CLEARLY WITH THE PROSECUTION LED BY SIR ALEXANDER COCKBURN
LJ017-0068 AND PUBLIC OPINION AT THE TERMINATION OF THE TRIAL COINCIDED WITH THE VERDICT OF THE JURY
LJ017-0069 ORIGINALLY A DOCTOR IN PRACTICE AT RUGELEY IN STAFFORDSHIRE HE HAD GRADUALLY WITHDRAWN FROM MEDICINE AND DEVOTED HIMSELF TO THE TURF
LJ017-0070 BUT HIS SPORTING OPERATIONS DID NOT PROSPER AND HE BECAME A NEEDY MAN ALWAYS DRIVEN TO DESPERATE STRAITS FOR CASH
LJ017-0071 TO MEET HIS LIABILITIES HE RAISED LARGE SUMS ON FORGED BILLS OF ACCEPTANCE DRAWN UPON HIS MOTHER A WOMAN OF SOME MEANS
LJ017-0072 WHOSE SIGNATURE HE COUNTERFEITED
LJ017-0073 IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY FOUR HE OWED A VERY LARGE SUM OF MONEY BUT HE WAS TEMPORARILY RELIEVED BY THE DEATH OF HIS WIFE
LJ017-0074 WHOSE LIFE HE HAD INSURED FOR £13000
LJ017-0075 THERE IS EVERY REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT HE POISONED HIS WIFE TO OBTAIN POSSESSION OF THIS SUM UPON HER DEATH
LJ017-0076 HIS BROTHER WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN HIS NEXT VICTIM UPON WHOSE LIFE HE HAD ALSO EFFECTED AN INSURANCE FOR ANOTHER £13000
LJ017-0077 THE BROTHER TOO DIED CONVENIENTLY BUT THE LIFE OFFICE TOOK SOME EXCEPTION TO THE MANNER OF THE DEATH AND HESITATED TO DISBURSE THE FUNDS CLAIMED BY PALMER
LJ017-0078 PALMER TRIED TO GET A NEW INSURANCE ON THE LIFE OF A HANGERON ONE BATES BUT NO OFFICE WOULD ACCEPT IT NO DOUBT GREATLY TO BATES'S LONGEVITY
LJ017-0079 MEANWHILE THE BILL DISCOUNTERS WHO HELD THE FORGED ACCEPTANCES WITH OTHER PROMISSORY NOTES BEGAN TO CLAMOR FOR PAYMENT AND TALK OF ISSUING WRITS
LJ017-0080 PALMER ALIVE TO THE DANGER HE RAN OF A PROSECUTION FOR FORGERY SHOULD THE FRAUD HE HAD COMMITTED BE BROUGHT TO LIGHT
LJ017-0081 SOUGHT ABOUT FOR A FRESH VICTIM TO SUPPLY HIM WITH FUNDS
LJ017-0082 HE FIXED UPON A SPORTING FRIEND MR. JOHN PARSONS COOK WHO HAD BEEN IN LUCK AT SHREWSBURY RACES BOTH AS A WINNER AND A BACKER
LJ017-0083 WHOM HE PERSUADED TO GO AND STAY AT RUGELEY IN AN HOTEL JUST OPPOSITE HIS OWN HOUSE
LJ017-0084 IT WAS THERE THAT COOK WAS FIRST TAKEN ILL WITH VIOLENT RETCHINGS AND VOMITINGS ALL DATING FROM VISITS OF PALMER WHO BROUGHT HIM MEDICINES AND FOOD
LJ017-0085 PALMER'S PLAN WAS TO ADMINISTER POISON IN QUANTITIES INSUFFICIENT TO CAUSE DEATH BUT ENOUGH TO PRODUCE ILLNESS WHICH WOULD ACCOUNT FOR DEATH
LJ017-0086 FOR THIS PURPOSE HE GAVE OR THERE WAS THE STRONGEST PRESUMPTION THAT HE GAVE
LJ017-0087 ANTIMONY WHICH CAUSED COOK'S CONSTANT SICKNESS
LJ017-0088 QUANTITIES OF ANTIMONY WERE FOUND IN THE BODY AFTER DEATH
LJ017-0089 WHILE COOK LAY ILL PALMER IN HIS NAME POCKETED THE PROCEEDS OF THE SHREWSBURY SETTLING
LJ017-0090 AND SO GOT THE MONEY FOR WHICH HE WAS PREPARED TO BARTER HIS SOUL
LJ017-0091 THE LAST ACT NOW APPROACHED AND IN ORDER TO AVOID THE DETECTION OF THIS LAST FRAUD PALMER LAID HIS PLANS FOR DISPOSING OF COOK
LJ017-0092 HE DECIDED TO USE STRYCHNIA OR THE VEGETABLE POISON OTHERWISE KNOWN AS NUX VOMICA
LJ017-0093 AND ONE OF THE MANY LINKS IN THE LONG CHAIN OF EVIDENCE WAS AN ENTRY IN A BOOK OF PALMER'S TO THE EFFECT THAT QUOTE
LJ017-0094 STRYCHNIA KILLS BY CAUSING TETANIC FIXING OF THE RESPIRATORY MUSCLES. END QUOTE
LJ017-0095 THE PURCHASE BY PALMER OF STRYCHNIA WAS PROVED
LJ017-0096 THE NIGHT HE BOUGHT IT COOK WHO HAD BEEN TAKING CERTAIN PILLS UNDER MEDICAL ADVICE NOT PALMER'S WAS SEIZED WITH VIOLENT CONVULSIONS
LJ017-0097 HE HAD SWALLOWED HIS PILLS AS USUAL AT LEAST PALMER HAD ADMINISTERED THEM
LJ017-0098 WHETHER THE ORDINARY OR HIS OWN PILLS WILL NEVER BE KNOWN EXCEPT AS MAY BE INFERRED FROM THE RESULTS WHICH INDICATE THAT HE HAD TAKEN THE LATTER
LJ017-0099 COOK RECOVERED THIS TIME IT WAS PROBABLY PALMER'S INTENTION THAT HE SHOULD RECOVER WISHING TO ENCOURAGE THE SUPPOSITION THAT COOK WAS IN A BAD WAY
LJ017-0100 NEXT NIGHT COOK HAD A SECOND AND A MORE VIOLENT ATTACK
LJ017-0101 THAT DAY PALMER HAD BOUGHT MORE STRYCHNIA AND HAD CALLED IN A FRESH DOCTOR
LJ017-0102 THE SECOND ATTACK WAS FATAL AND ENDED IN COOK'S DEATH FROM TETANUS
LJ017-0103 THIS TETANUS ACCORDING TO THE PROSECUTION WAS PRODUCED BY STRYCHNIA AND FOLLOWED THE ADMINISTRATION OF PILLS BY PALMER
LJ017-0104 PRESCRIBED NOMINALLY BY THE FRESH DOCTOR FOR WHICH PALMER HAD SUBSTITUTED HIS OWN
LJ017-0105 COOK'S DEATH WAS HORRIBLE
LJ017-0106 FEARFUL PAROXYSMS AND CRAMPS ENDING IN SUFFOCATION BY THE TETANIC RIGOR WHICH CAUGHT THE MUSCLES OF THE CHEST
LJ017-0107 AFTER COOK'S DEATH HIS STEPFATHER WHO WAS MUCH ATTACHED TO HIM CAME TO RUGELEY
LJ017-0108 HE WAS STRUCK WITH THE APPEARANCE OF THE CORPSE WHICH WAS NOT EMACIATED AS AFTER A LONG DISEASE ENDING IN DEATH
LJ017-0109 WHILE THE MUSCLES OF THE FINGERS WERE TIGHTLY CLENCHED NOT OPEN AS USUAL IN A CORPSE
LJ017-0110 HE SAID NOTHING BUT BEGAN TO FEEL UNEASY WHEN HE FOUND THAT COOK'S BETTINGBOOK WAS MISSING AND THAT PALMER PUT IT FORWARD
LJ017-0111 THAT HIS FRIEND HAD DIED GREATLY EMBARRASSED WITH BILLS TO THE AMOUNT OF £4000 OUT IN HIS NAME
LJ017-0112 PALMER TOO SHOWED AN INDECENT HASTE IN PREPARING THE BODY FOR INTERMENT AND IN OBTAINING THE USUAL CERTIFICATE
LJ017-0113 AFTER THIS THE STEPFATHER INSISTED UPON A POSTMORTEM WHICH WAS CONDUCTED SOMEWHAT CARELESSLY
LJ017-0114 THE INTESTINES WERE HOWEVER PRESERVED AND SENT FOR ANALYSIS
LJ017-0115 BUT IT WAS PROVED THAT PALMER TRIED HARD TO GET POSSESSION OF THE JAR CONTAINING THEM
LJ017-0116 AND EVEN SOUGHT TO UPSET THE VEHICLE BY WHICH THEY WERE BEING CONVEYED A PART OF THE WAY TO LONDON
LJ017-0117 THE EXAMINATION OF THE STOMACH BETRAYED THE PRESENCE OF ANTIMONY IN LARGE QUANTITIES BUT NO STRYCHNIA
LJ017-0118 AND IT WAS ON THE ENTIRE ABSENCE OF THE LATTER THAT THE DEFENSE WAS PRINCIPALLY BASED WHEN PALMER WAS BROUGHT TO TRIAL
LJ017-0119 ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE SO SUSPICIOUS THAT HE COULD NOT ESCAPE THE CRIMINAL CHARGE
LJ017-0120 HE HAD ALREADY BEEN ARRESTED ON A WRIT ISSUED AT THE INSTANCE OF THE MONEYLENDERS AND AN ACTION HAD BEEN COMMENCED AGAINST MRS. PALMER ON HER ACCEPTANCES
LJ017-0121 IT CAME OUT AT ONCE THAT THESE HAD BEEN FORGED AND THE WHOLE AFFAIR AT ONCE TOOK THE UGLIEST COMPLEXION
LJ017-0122 A GOVERNMENT PROSECUTION WAS INSTITUTED AND PALMER WAS BROUGHT TO NEWGATE FOR TRIAL AT THE CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT
LJ017-0123 THERE WAS NOT MUCH RESERVE ABOUT HIM WHEN THERE
LJ017-0124 HE FREQUENTLY DECLARED BEFORE AND DURING THE TRIAL THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND HIM GUILTY
LJ017-0125 HE NEVER ACTUALLY SAID THAT HE WAS NOT GUILTY BUT HE WAS CONFIDENT HE WOULD NOT BE CONVICTED
LJ017-0126 HE RELIED ON THE ABSENCE OF THE STRYCHNIA
LJ017-0127 BUT THE CHAIN OF CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO SATISFY THE JURY WHO AGREED TO THEIR VERDICT IN AN HOUR
LJ017-0128 AT THE LAST MOMENT PALMER TOSSED A BIT OF PAPER OVER TO HIS COUNSEL ON WHICH HE HAD WRITTEN QUOTE I THINK THERE WILL BE A VERDICT OF NOT GUILTY END QUOTE
LJ017-0129 EVEN AFTER THE DEATH SENTENCE HAD BEEN PASSED UPON HIM HE CLUNG TO THE HOPE THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD GRANT HIM A REPRIEVE
LJ017-0130 TO THE LAST THEREFORE HE PLAYED THE PART OF A MAN WRONGFULLY CONVICTED AND DID NOT ABANDON HOPE
LJ017-0131 EVEN WHEN THE HIGH SHERIFF HAD TOLD HIM THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF A REPRIEVE AND WITHIN A FEW HOURS OF EXECUTION
LJ017-0132 HE SUFFERED AT STAFFORD IN FRONT OF THE JAIL
LJ017-0133 PALMER SPEEDILY FOUND IMITATORS
LJ017-0134 WITHIN A FEW WEEKS OCCURRED THE LEEDS POISONING CASE IN WHICH THE MURDERER UNDOUBTEDLY WAS INSPIRED BY THE FACTS MADE PUBLIC AT PALMER'S TRIAL
LJ017-0135 DOVE A FIENDISH BRUTE FOUND FROM THE EVIDENCE IN THAT CASE THAT HE COULD KILL HIS WIFE WHOM HE HATED
LJ017-0136 WITH EXQUISITE TORTURE AND WITH A POISON THAT WOULD LEAVE AS HE THOUGHT NO TRACE
LJ017-0137 IN THE LATTER HOPE HE WAS HAPPILY DISAPPOINTED. BUT AS THIS CASE IS BEYOND MY SUBJECT I MERELY MENTION IT AS ONE OF THE GROUP ALREADY REFERRED TO
LJ017-0138 THREE YEARS LATER CAME THE CASE OF DR. SMETHURST
LJ017-0139 PRESENTING STILL GREATER FEATURES OF RESEMBLANCE WITH PALMER'S FOR BOTH WERE MEDICAL MEN AND BOTH RAISED DIFFICULT QUESTIONS OF MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE
LJ017-0140 IN BOTH THE JURY HAD NO DOUBT AS TO THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED ONLY IN SMETHURST'S CASE THE THEN HOME SECRETARY SIR GEORGE CORNEWALL LEWIS
LJ017-0141 COULD NOT DIVEST HIS MIND OF SERIOUS DOUBT AND OF WHICH THE MURDERER GOT THE BENEFIT
LJ017-0142 SMETHURST'S ESCAPE MAY HAVE INFLUENCED THE JURY IN THE POPLAR POISONING CASE
LJ017-0143 WHICH FOLLOWED CLOSE ON ITS HEELS ALTHOUGH IN THAT THE VERDICT OF NOT GUILTY WAS EXCUSABLE AS THE EVIDENCE WAS ENTIRELY CIRCUMSTANTIAL
LJ017-0144 THERE WAS NO CONVINCING PROOF THAT THE ACCUSED HAD ADMINISTERED THE POISON ALTHOUGH BEYOND QUESTION THAT POISON HAD OCCASIONED THE DEATH
LJ017-0145 DR. SMETHURST WAS LONG AN INMATE OF NEWGATE AND WAS TRIED AT THE CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT
LJ017-0146 HE HAD ALL THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE POISONER  THE CALM DELIBERATION
LJ017-0147 THE PROTRACTED DISSIMULATION AS WITH UNSHRINKING RELENTLESS WICKEDNESS THE DEADLY WORK IS CARRIED ON TO THE END
LJ017-0148 SMETHURST'S VICTIM WAS A MISS BANKES WITH WHOM HE HAD CONTRACTED A BIGAMOUS MARRIAGE
LJ017-0149 HE HAD MET HER AT A BOARDINGHOUSE WHERE HE LIVED WITH HIS OWN WIFE A PERSON OF SHADY ANTECEDENTS
LJ017-0150 AND WHOM HE LEFT WITHOUT SCRUPLE TO JOIN MISS BANKES
LJ017-0151 THE LATTER SEEMS TO HAVE SUCCUMBED ONLY TOO WILLINGLY TO HIS FASCINATIONS AND TO HAVE AS READILY AGREED TO MARRY HIM
LJ017-0152 IN SPITE OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE OTHER MRS. SMETHURST
LJ017-0153 PROBABLY THE DOCTOR HAD TOLD HER THE STORY HE BROUGHT FORWARD WHEN TRIED FOR BIGAMY NAMELY
LJ017-0154 THAT MRS. SMETHURST HAD NO RIGHT TO THE NAME BUT HAD A HUSBAND OF HER OWN ONE JOHNSON ALIVE  A STORY SUBSEQUENTLY DISPROVED
LJ017-0155 MISS BANKES SEEMS TO HAVE COUNTED UPON SOME SPECIES OF WHITEWASHING NO LESS THAN THE REPUDIATION OF THE OTHER MARRIAGE
LJ017-0156 AND TOLD HER SISTER AS MUCH WHEN THEY LAST MET
LJ017-0157 FOR SOME MONTHS SMETHURST AND MISS BANKES LIVED TOGETHER AS MAN AND WIFE FIRST IN LONDON AND THEN AT RICHMOND
LJ017-0158 SHE HAD A LITTLE FORTUNE OF HER OWN SOME £1700 OR £1800
LJ017-0159 AND A LIFEINTEREST IN FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS A FACT ON WHICH SMETHURST'S COUNSEL DWELT WITH MUCH WEIGHT
LJ017-0160 AS INDICATING A MOTIVE FOR KEEPING HER ALIVE RATHER THAN KILLING HER
LJ017-0161 BUT PROBABLY THE LUMP SUM WAS THE BAIT OR PERHAPS SMETHURST WISHED TO RETURN TO HIS TEMPORARILY DESERTED FIRST WIFE
LJ017-0162 WHATEVER THE EXACT CAUSE WHICH IMPELLED HIM TO CRIME IT SEEMS CERTAIN THAT HE BEGAN TO GIVE HER SOME POISON
LJ017-0163 EITHER ARSENIC OR ANTIMONY OR BOTH IN SMALL QUANTITIES
LJ017-0164 WITH THE IDEA OF SUBJECTING HER TO THE IRRITANT POISON SLOWLY BUT SURELY UNTIL THE DESIRED EFFECT DEATH WAS ACHIEVED
LJ017-0165 AS SHE BECAME WORSE AND WORSE SMETHURST CALLED IN THE BEST MEDICAL ADVICE IN RICHMOND
LJ017-0166 BUT WAS CAREFUL TO PRIME THEM WITH HIS FACTS AND LEAD THEM IF POSSIBLE TO ACCEPT HIS DIAGNOSIS OF THE CASE
LJ017-0167 SMETHURST WAS FOUND GUILTY BY THE JURY AND SENTENCED TO DEATH
LJ017-0168 BUT A LONG PUBLIC DISCUSSION FOLLOWED AND IN CONSEQUENCE HE WAS REPRIEVED
LJ017-0169 THE HOME SECRETARY IN A LETTER TO THE LORD CHIEF BARON STATED THAT QUOTE ALTHOUGH THE FACTS ARE FULL OF SUSPICION AGAINST SMETHURST
LJ017-0170 THERE IS NOT ABSOLUTE AND COMPLETE EVIDENCE OF HIS GUILT END QUOTE
LJ017-0171 SMETHURST WAS THEREFORE GIVEN A FREE PARDON FOR THE OFFENSE OF MURDER
LJ017-0172 BUT HE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY AGAIN TRIED FOR BIGAMY AND SENTENCED TO TWELVE MONTHS' IMPRISONMENT
LJ017-0173 CATHERINE WILSON WAS A FEMALE POISONER WHO DID BUSINESS WHOLESALE
LJ017-0174 SHE WAS TRIED IN APRIL EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO ON SUSPICION OF HAVING ATTEMPTED TO POISON A NEIGHBOR WITH OIL OF VITRIOL
LJ017-0175 THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE STRANGE MRS. WILSON HAD GONE TO THE CHEMIST'S FOR MEDICINE
LJ017-0176 AND ON HER RETURN HAD ADMINISTERED A DOSE OF SOMETHING WHICH BURNT THE MOUTH BADLY BUT DID NOT PROVE FATAL
LJ017-0177 WILSON WAS ACQUITTED ON THIS CHARGE BUT OTHER SUSPICIOUS FACTS CROPPED UP WHILE SHE WAS IN NEWGATE
LJ017-0178 IT APPEARED THAT SEVERAL PERSONS WITH WHOM SHE WAS INTIMATE HAD SUCCUMBED SUDDENLY
LJ017-0179 IN ALL CASES THE SYMPTOMS WERE MUCH THE SAME
LJ017-0180 VOMITING VIOLENT RETCHING PURGING SUCH AS ARE VISIBLE IN CHOLERA AND ALL DATED FROM THE TIME WHEN SHE KNEW A YOUNG MAN NAMED DIXON
LJ017-0181 WHO HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF TAKING COLCHICUM FOR RHEUMATISM. MRS. WILSON HEARD THEN CASUALLY FROM A MEDICAL MAN
LJ017-0182 THAT IT WAS A VERY DANGEROUS MEDICINE AND SHE PROFITED BY WHAT SHE HAD HEARD
LJ017-0183 SOON AFTERWARDS DIXON DIED SHOWING ALL THE SYMPTOMS ALREADY DESCRIBED
LJ017-0184 SOON AFTERWARDS A FRIEND MRS. ATKINSON CAME TO LONDON FROM WESTMORELAND AND STAYED IN MRS. WILSON'S HOUSE
LJ017-0185 SHE WAS IN GOOD HEALTH ON LEAVING HOME AND HAD WITH HER A LARGE SUM OF MONEY
LJ017-0186 WHILE WITH MRS. WILSON SHE BECAME SUDDENLY AND ALARMINGLY ILL AND DIED IN GREAT AGONY
LJ017-0187 HER HUSBAND WHO CAME UP TO TOWN WOULD NOT ALLOW A POSTMORTEM AND AGAIN MRS. WILSON ESCAPED
LJ017-0188 MRS. ATKINSON'S SYMPTOMS HAD BEEN THE SAME AS DIXON'S. THEN MRS. WILSON WENT TO LIVE WITH A MAN NAMED TAYLOR
LJ017-0189 WHO WAS PRESENTLY ATTACKED IN THE SAME WAY AS THE OTHERS BUT BUT THANKS TO THE PROMPT ADMINISTRATION OF REMEDIES HE RECOVERED
LJ017-0190 AFTER THIS CAME THE CHARGE OF ADMINISTERING OIL OF VITRIOL WHICH FAILED AS HAS BEEN DESCRIBED
LJ017-0191 LAST OF ALL MRS. WILSON POISONED HER LANDLADY MRS. SOAMES UNDER PRECISELY THE SAME CONDITIONS AS THE FOREGOING
LJ017-0192 HERE HOWEVER THE EVIDENCE WAS STRONG AND SUFFICIENT
LJ017-0193 IT WAS PROVED THAT MRS. WILSON HAD GIVEN MRS. SOAMES SOMETHING PECULIAR TO DRINK
LJ017-0194 THAT IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS MRS. SOAMES WAS TAKEN ILL WITH VOMITING AND PURGING
LJ017-0195 AND THAT MRS. WILSON ADMINISTERED THE SAME MEDICINE AGAIN AND AGAIN
LJ017-0196 THE LAST TIME MRS. SOAMES SHOWED GREAT RELUCTANCE TO TAKE IT BUT WILSON SAID IT WOULD CERTAINLY DO HER GOOD
LJ017-0197 THIS MYSTERIOUS MEDICINE WILSON KEPT CAREFULLY LOCKED UP AND ALLOWED NO ONE TO SEE IT
LJ017-0198 BUT ITS NATURE WAS BETRAYED WHEN THIS LAST VICTIM ALSO DIED
LJ017-0199 THE FIRST POSTMORTEM INDICATED DEATH FROM NATURAL CAUSES
LJ017-0200 BUT A MORE CAREFUL INVESTIGATION ATTRIBUTED IT BEYOND DOUBT TO OVERDOSES OF COLCHICUM
LJ017-0201 DR. ALFRED TAYLOR THE GREAT AUTHORITY AND WRITER ON MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE CORROBORATED THIS AND IN HIS EVIDENCE ON THE TRIAL
LJ017-0202 FAIRLY ELECTRIFIED THE COURT BY DECLARING IT HIS OPINION THAT MANY DEATHS SUPPOSED TO BE FROM CHOLERA WERE REALLY DUE TO POISON
LJ017-0203 THIS FACT WAS REFERRED TO BY THE JUDGE IN HIS SUMMING UP
LJ017-0204 WHO SAID THAT HE FEARED IT WAS ONLY TOO TRUE THAT SECRET POISONING WAS AT THAT TIME VERY RIFE IN THE METROPOLIS
LJ017-0205 WILSON WAS DULY SENTENCED TO DEATH AND SUFFERED IMPENITENT HARDENED AND WITHOUT ANY CONFESSION OF HER GUILT
LJ017-0206 ALTHOUGH MURDER BY INSIDIOUS METHODS HAD BECOME MORE COMMON CASES WHERE VIOLENCE OF THE MOST DEADLY AND DETERMINED KIND WAS OFFERED
LJ017-0207 HAD NOT QUITE DISAPPEARED. I WILL MENTION TWO CASES OF THIS CLASS ONE ACCOMPANIED WITH PIRACY ON THE HIGH SEAS
LJ017-0208 THE OTHER PERPETRATED IN A RAILWAYCARRIAGE AND SHOWING THE PROMPTITUDE WITH WHICH CRIMINALS ACCEPT AND UTILIZE ALTERED CONDITIONS OF LIFE
LJ017-0209 MORE PARTICULARLY AS REGARDS LOCOMOTION
LJ017-0210 THE FIRST CASE WAS THAT OF THE 'FLOWERY LAND'
LJ017-0211 WHICH LEFT LONDON FOR SINGAPORE ON THE 28TH JULY EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE WITH A CARGO OF WINE AND OTHER GOODS
LJ017-0212 HER CAPTAIN WAS JOHN SMITH
LJ017-0213 THE FIRST AND SECOND MATES KARSWELL AND TAFFIR THERE WERE TWO OTHER ENGLISHMEN ON BOARD AND THE REST OF THE CREW WERE A POLYGLOT LOT
LJ017-0214 MOST OF THEM AS WAS PROVED BY THEIR SUBSEQUENT ACTS BLACKGUARDS OF THE DEEPEST DYE
LJ017-0215 SIX WERE SPANIARDS OR RATHER NATIVES OF MANILLA AND MEN OF COLOR ONE WAS A GREEK ANOTHER A TURK
LJ017-0216 THERE WERE ALSO A FRENCHMAN A NORWEGIAN THE CARPENTER THREE CHINAMEN A SCLAVONIAN AND A BLACK ON BOARD
LJ017-0217 NAVIGATION AND DISCIPLINE COULD NOT BE EASY WITH SUCH A NONDESCRIPT CREW
LJ017-0218 THE CAPTAIN WAS KINDLY BUT SOMEWHAT INTEMPERATE THE FIRST MATE A MAN OF SOME DETERMINATION
LJ017-0219 AND PUNISHMENT SUCH AS ROPE'SENDING AND TYING TO THE BULWARKS HAD TO BE APPLIED TO GET THE WORK PROPERLY DONE
LJ017-0220 THE SIX SPANIARDS THE GREEK AND THE TURK WERE IN THE SAME WATCH
LJ017-0221 EIGHT TRUCULENT AND RECKLESS SCOUNDRELS WHO BROODING OVER THEIR FANCIED WRONGS AND BURNING FOR REVENGE
LJ017-0222 HATCHED AMONGST THEM A PLOT TO MURDER THEIR OFFICERS AND SEIZE THE SHIP
LJ017-0223 THE MUTINY WAS ORGANIZED WITH GREAT SECRECY AND BROKE OUT MOST UNEXPECTEDLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
LJ017-0224 A SIMULTANEOUS ATTACK WAS MADE UPON THE CAPTAIN AND THE FIRST MATE
LJ017-0225 THE LATTER HAD THE WATCH ON DECK
LJ017-0226 ONE HALF OF THE MUTINEERS FELL UPON HIM UNAWARES WITH HANDSPIKES AND CAPSTANBARS
LJ017-0227 HE WAS STRUCK DOWN IMPLORING MERCY BUT THEY BEAT HIM ABOUT THE HEAD AND FACE
LJ017-0228 TILL EVERY FEATURE WAS OBLITERATED AND THEN STILL LIVING FLUNG HIM INTO THE SEA
LJ017-0229 MEANWHILE THE CAPTAIN ROUSED FROM HIS BERTH
LJ017-0230 CAME OUT OF THE CABIN WAS CAUGHT NEAR THE 'COMPANION' BY THE REST OF THE MUTINEERS AND PROMPTLY DISPATCHED WITH DAGGERS
LJ017-0231 HIS BODY WAS FOUND LYING IN A POOL OF BLOOD IN A NIGHTDRESS STABBED OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN THE LEFT SIDE
LJ017-0232 THE CAPTAIN'S BROTHER A PASSENGER ON BOARD THE 'FLOWERY LAND' WAS ALSO STABBED TO DEATH AND HIS BODY THROWN OVERBOARD
LJ017-0233 THE SECOND MATE WHO HAD HEARD THE HAMMERING OF THE CAPSTANBARS AND THE HANDSPIKES WITH THE FIRST MATE'S AND CAPTAIN'S AGONIZED CRIES HAD COME OUT
LJ017-0234 VERIFIED THE MURDERERS AND THEN SHUT HIMSELF UP IN HIS CABIN
LJ017-0235 HE WAS SOON SUMMONED ON DECK BUT AS HE WOULD NOT MOVE THE MUTINEERS CAME DOWN AND STOOD IN A CIRCLE ROUND HIS BERTH
LJ017-0236 LEON OR LYONS WHO SPOKE ENGLISH
LJ017-0237 WHEN ASKED SAID THEY WOULD SPARE HIS LIFE IF HE WOULD NAVIGATE THE SHIP FOR THEM TO THE RIVER PLATE OR BUENOS AIRES
LJ017-0238 TAFFIR THE SECOND MATE AGREED BUT CONSTANTLY WENT IN FEAR OF HIS LIFE FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE VOYAGE
LJ017-0239 AND ALTHOUGH THE MUTINEERS SPARED HIM THEY ILLTREATED THE CHINAMEN AND CUT ONE BADLY WITH KNIVES
LJ017-0240 IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE MURDER CASES OF CHAMPAGNE WHICH FORMED PART OF THE CARGO WERE BROUGHT ON DECK AND BROACHED
LJ017-0241 THE CAPTAIN'S CABIN RANSACKED HIS MONEY AND CLOTHES DIVIDED AMONGST THE MUTINEERS AS WELL AS MUCH OF THE MERCHANDISE ON BOARD
LJ017-0242 LEON WISHED TO MAKE EVERY ONE ON BOARD SHARE AND SHARE ALIKE SO AS TO IMPLICATE THE INNOCENT WITH THE GUILTY
LJ017-0243 BUT VARTOS OR WATTO THE TURK WOULD NOT ALLOW ANY BUT THE EIGHT MUTINEERS TO HAVE ANYTHING
LJ017-0244 THE MURDERS WERE PERPETRATED ON THE 10TH SEPTEMBER AND THE SHIP CONTINUED HER VOYAGE FOR NEARLY THREE WEEKS MEETING AND SPEAKING ONE SHIP ONLY
LJ017-0245 ON THE 2ND OCTOBER THEY SIGHTED LAND TEN MILES DISTANT
LJ017-0246 THE MUTINEERS TOOK COMMAND OF THE SHIP PUT HER ABOUT TILL NIGHTFALL BY WHICH TIME THEY HAD SCUTTLED HER GOT OUT THE BOATS AND ALL LEFT THE SHIP
LJ017-0247 THE REST OF THE CREW WERE ALSO PERMITTED TO EMBARK EXCEPT THE CHINAMEN ONE OF WHOM WAS THROWN INTO THE WATER AND DROWNED
LJ017-0248 WHILE THE OTHER TWO WERE LEFT TO GO DOWN IN THE SHIP AND WERE SEEN CLINGING TO THE TOPS UNTIL THE WATERS CLOSED OVER THEM
LJ017-0249 THE BOATS REACHED THE SHORE ON THE 4TH OCTOBER. LEON HAD PREPARED A PLAUSIBLE TALE TO THE EFFECT THAT THEY BELONGED TO AN AMERICAN SHIP
LJ017-0250 FROM PERU BOUND TO BORDEAUX WHICH HAD FOUNDERED AT SEA
LJ017-0251 THAT THEY HAD BEEN IN THE BOATS FIVE DAYS AND NIGHTS BUT THAT THE CAPTAIN AND OTHERS HAD BEEN LOST
LJ017-0252 THE PLACE AT WHICH THEY LANDED WAS NOT FAR FROM THE ENTRANCE TO THE RIVER PLATE
LJ017-0253 A FARMER TOOK THEM IN FOR THE NIGHT AND DROVE THEM NEXT DAY TO ROCHA A PLACE NORTH OF MALDONADO
LJ017-0254 TAFFIR THE MATE FINDING THERE WAS A MAN WHO COULD SPEAK ENGLISH AT ANOTHER PLACE TWENTY MILES OFF
LJ017-0255 REPAIRED THERE SECRETLY AND SO GAVE INFORMATION TO THE BRAZILIAN AUTHORITIES
LJ017-0256 THE MUTINEERS WERE ARRESTED THE CASE INQUIRED INTO BY A NAVAL COURTMARTIAL
LJ017-0257 AND THE PRISONERS EVENTUALLY SURRENDERED TO THE BRITISH AUTHORITIES BROUGHT TO ENGLAND AND LODGED IN NEWGATE
LJ017-0258 THEIR TRIAL FOLLOWED AT THE CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT
LJ017-0259 EIGHT WERE ARRAIGNED AT THE SAME TIME SIX SPANIARDS LEON BLANCO DURANNO SANTOS AND MARSOLINO
LJ017-0260 VARTOS THE TURK AND CARLOS THE GREEK
LJ017-0261 SEVEN WERE FOUND GUILTY OF MURDER ON THE HIGH SEAS AND ONE CARLOS ACQUITTED
LJ017-0262 TWO OF THE SEVEN SANTOS AND MARSOLINO WERE REPRIEVED AND THEIR SENTENCES COMMUTED TO PENAL SERVITUDE FOR LIFE
LJ017-0263 THE REMAINING FIVE WERE EXECUTED IN ONE BATCH
LJ017-0264 THEY WERE AN ABJECT MISERABLE CREW COWARDS AT HEART BUT SOME ESPECIALLY LOPEZ CONTINUED BLOODTHIRSTY TO THE LAST
LJ017-0265 LOPEZ TOOK A VIOLENT DISLIKE TO THE OFFICER OF THE WARD IN CHARGE OF THEM AND OFTEN EXPRESSED A KEEN DESIRE TO DO FOR HIM
LJ017-0266 THEY NONE OF THEM SPOKE MUCH ENGLISH EXCEPT LEON COMMONLY CALLED LYONS
LJ017-0267 AFTER CONDEMNATION AS THE RULES NOW KEPT CAPITAL CONVICTS STRICTLY APART THEY COULD NOT BE LODGED IN THE TWO CONDEMNED CELLS
LJ017-0268 AND THEY WERE EACH KEPT IN AN ORDINARY SEPARATE CELL OF THE NEWLYCONSTRUCTED BLOCK WITH THE TRAPS OR SQUARE OPENINGS IN THE CELL DOOR
LJ017-0269 LET DOWN. A FULL VIEW OF THEM WAS THUS AT ALL TIMES OBTAINABLE BY THE OFFICERS WHO WITHOUT INTERMISSION DAY AND NIGHT PATROLLED THE WARD
LJ017-0270 ON THE MORNING OF EXECUTION THE NOISE OF FIXING THE GALLOWS IN THE STREET OUTSIDE AWOKE ONE OR TWO OF THEM
LJ017-0271 LYONS ASKED THE TIME AND WAS TOLD IT WAS ONLY FIVE
LJ017-0272 AH HE REMARKED THEY WILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR US THEN TILL EIGHT
LJ017-0273 LOPEZ WAS MORE TALKATIVE
LJ017-0274 WHEN THE WARDER WENT IN TO CALL HIM HE ASKED FOR HIS CLOTHES. HE WAS TOLD HE WOULD HAVE TO WEAR HIS OWN
LJ017-0276 THEN HE WANTED TO KNOW WHEN THE POLICEMEN WOULD ARRIVE AND WAS TOLD NONE WOULD COME
LJ017-0277 THE SOLDIERS THEN
LJ017-0278 NO SOLDIERS EITHER
LJ017-0280 THE CONVICTS WERE PINIONED ONE BY ONE AND SENT SINGLY OUT TO THE GALLOWS
LJ017-0281 AS THE FIRST TO APPEAR WOULD HAVE SOME TIME TO WAIT FOR HIS FELLOWS A DIFFICULT AND PAINFUL ORDEAL
LJ017-0282 THE SEEMINGLY MOST COURAGEOUS WAS SELECTED TO LEAD THE WAY
LJ017-0283 THIS WAS DURANNO BUT THE SIGHT OF THE HEAVING MASS OF UPLIFTED IMPASSIONED FACES
LJ017-0284 WAS TOO MUCH FOR HIS NERVES AND HE SO NEARLY FAINTED THAT HE HAD TO BE SEATED IN A CHAIR
LJ018-0001 THE CHRONICLES OF NEWGATE VOLUME TWO BY ARTHUR GRIFFITHS SECTION TWENTY ONE NEWGATE NOTORIETIES PART TWO
LJ018-0002 IN JULY 1864 OCCURRED THE MURDER OF MR. BRIGGS A GENTLEMAN ADVANCED IN YEARS AND CHIEF CLERK IN ROBARTS' BANK
LJ018-0003 AS THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH IT WAS PERPETRATED WERE SOMEWHAT NOVEL
LJ018-0004 AND AS SOME TIME ELAPSED BEFORE THE DISCOVERY AND APPREHENSION OF THE SUPPOSED MURDERER
LJ018-0005 THE PUBLIC MIND WAS GREATLY AGITATED BY THE AFFAIR FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. THE STORY OF THE MURDER MUST BE PRETTY FAMILIAR TO MOST OF MY READERS
LJ018-0006 MR. BRIGGS LEFT THE BANK ONE AFTERNOON AS USUAL DINED WITH HIS DAUGHTER AT PECKHAM
LJ018-0007 THEN RETURNED TO THE CITY TO TAKE THE TRAIN FROM FENCHURCH STREET HOME TRAVELING BY THE NORTH LONDON RAILWAY
LJ018-0008 HE LIVED AT HACKNEY BUT HE NEVER REACHED IT ALIVE
LJ018-0009 WHEN THE TRAIN ARRIVED AT HACKNEY STATION A PASSENGER WHO WAS ABOUT TO ENTER ONE OF THE CARRIAGES FOUND THE CUSHIONS SOAKED WITH BLOOD
LJ018-0010 INSIDE THE CARRIAGE WAS A HAT A WALKINGSTICK AND A SMALL BLACK LEATHER BAG
LJ018-0011 ABOUT THE SAME TIME A BODY WAS DISCOVERED ON THE LINE NEAR THE RAILWAYBRIDGE BY VICTORIA PARK
LJ018-0012 IT WAS THAT OF AN AGED MAN WHOSE HEAD HAD BEEN BATTERED IN BY A LIFEPRESERVER
LJ018-0013 THERE WAS A DEEP WOUND JUST OVER THE EAR THE SKULL WAS FRACTURED AND THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER BLOWS AND WOUNDS ON THE HEAD
LJ018-0014 STRANGE TO SAY THE UNFORTUNATE MAN WAS NOT YET DEAD AND HE ACTUALLY SURVIVED MORE THAN FOURANDTWENTY HOURS
LJ018-0015 HIS IDENTITY WAS ESTABLISHED BY A BUNDLE OF LETTERS IN HIS POCKET WHICH BORE HIS FULL ADDRESS
LJ018-0016 T. BRIGGS ESQ. ROBARTS & CO. LOMBARD STREET
LJ018-0017 THE FRIENDS OF MR. BRIGGS WERE COMMUNICATED WITH AND IT WAS ASCERTAINED THAT WHEN HE LEFT HOME THE MORNING OF THE MURDEROUS ATTACK
LJ018-0018 HE WORE GOLDRIMMED EYEGLASSES AND A GOLD WATCH AND CHAIN
LJ018-0019 THE STICK AND BAG WERE HIS BUT NOT THE HAT
LJ018-0020 A DESPERATE AND DEADLY STRUGGLE MUST HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN THE CARRIAGE AND THE STAIN OF A BLOODY HAND MARKED THE DOOR
LJ018-0021 THE FACTS OF THE MURDER AND ITS OBJECT ROBBERY WERE THUS CONCLUSIVELY PROVED
LJ018-0022 IT WAS ALSO EASILY ESTABLISHED THAT THE HAT FOUND IN THE CARRIAGE HAD BEEN BOUGHT AT WALKER'S A HATTER'S IN CRAWFORD STREET
LJ018-0023 MARYLEBONE WHILE WITHIN A FEW DAYS MR. BRIGGS' GOLD CHAIN WAS TRACED TO A JEWELER'S IN CHEAPSIDE
LJ018-0024 MR. DEATH WHO HAD GIVEN ANOTHER IN EXCHANGE FOR IT TO A MAN SUPPOSED TO BE A FOREIGNER
LJ018-0025 MORE PRECISE CLUES TO THE MURDERER WERE NOT LONG WANTING INDEED THE READINESS WITH WHICH THEY WERE PRODUCED AND FOLLOWED UP
LJ018-0026 SHOWED HOW GREATLY THE PUBLICITY AND WIDE DISSEMINATION OF THE NEWS REGARDING MURDER FACILITATE THE DETECTION OF CRIME
LJ018-0027 IN LITTLE MORE THAN A WEEK A CABMAN CAME FORWARD AND VOLUNTARILY MADE A STATEMENT WHICH AT ONCE DREW SUSPICION TO A GERMAN FRANZ MÜLLER
LJ018-0028 WHO HAD BEEN A LODGER OF HIS. MÜLLER HAD GIVEN THE CABMAN'S LITTLE DAUGHTER A JEWELER'S CARDBOARD BOX BEARING THE NAME OF MR. DEATH
LJ018-0029 A PHOTOGRAPH OF MÜLLER SHOWN THE JEWELER WAS IDENTIFIED AS THE LIKENESS OF THE MAN WHO HAD EXCHANGED MR. BRIGGS' CHAIN
LJ018-0030 LAST OF ALL THE CABMAN SWORE THAT HE HAD BOUGHT THE VERY HAT FOUND IN THE CARRIAGE FOR MÜLLER AT THE HATTER'S WALKER'S OF CRAWFORD STREET
LJ018-0031 THIS FIXED THE CRIME PRETTY CERTAINLY UPON MÜLLER WHO HAD ALREADY LEFT THE COUNTRY THUS INCREASING SUSPICION UNDER WHICH HE LAY
LJ018-0032 THERE WAS NO MYSTERY ABOUT HIS DEPARTURE HE HAD GONE TO CANADA BY THE 'VICTORIA' SAILING SHIP STARTING FROM THE LONDON DOCKS AND BOUND TO NEW YORK
LJ018-0033 DIRECTLY THE FOREGOING FACTS WERE ESTABLISHED A COUPLE OF DETECTIVE OFFICERS ARMED WITH A WARRANT TO ARREST MÜLLER
LJ018-0034 AND ACCOMPANIED BY MR. DEATH THE JEWELER AND THE CABMAN WENT DOWN TO LIVERPOOL AND TOOK THE FIRST STEAMER ACROSS THE ATLANTIC
LJ018-0035 THIS WAS THE 'CITY OF MANCHESTER' WHICH WAS EXPECTED TO ARRIVE SOME DAYS BEFORE THE 'VICTORIA' AND DID SO
LJ018-0036 THE OFFICERS WENT ON BOARD THE 'VICTORIA' AT ONCE MÜLLER WAS IDENTIFIED BY MR. DEATH AND THE ARREST WAS MADE
LJ018-0037 IN SEARCHING THE PRISONER'S BOX MR. BRIGGS' WATCH WAS FOUND WRAPPED UP IN A PIECE OF LEATHER
LJ018-0038 AND MÜLLER AT THE TIME OF HIS CAPTURE WAS ACTUALLY WEARING MR. BRIGGS' HAT CUT DOWN AND SOMEWHAT ALTERED
LJ018-0039 THE PRISONER WAS FORTHWITH EXTRADITED AND SENT BACK TO ENGLAND WHICH HE REACHED WITH HIS ESCORT ON THE 17TH SEPTEMBER THE SAME YEAR
LJ018-0040 HIS TRIAL FOLLOWED AT THE NEXT SESSIONS OF THE CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT AND ENDED IN HIS CONVICTION
LJ018-0041 THE CASE WAS ONE OF CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE BUT AS SIR ROBERT COLLYER THE SOLICITORGENERAL POINTED OUT
LJ018-0042 IT WAS THE STRONGEST CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE WHICH HAD EVER BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD IN A MURDER CASE
LJ018-0043 IT WAS REALLY EVIDENCE OF FACTS WHICH COULD NOT BE CONTROVERTED OR EXPLAINED AWAY
LJ018-0044 THERE WAS THE PRISONER'S POVERTY HIS INABILITY TO ACCOUNT FOR HIMSELF ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER AND HIS POSSESSION OF THE PROPERTY OF THE MURDERED MAN
LJ018-0045 AN ALIBI WAS SET UP FOR THE DEFENSE BUT NOT WELL SUBSTANTIATED AND THE JURY WITHOUT HESITATION RETURNED A VERDICT OF GUILTY
LJ018-0046 MÜLLER PROTESTED AFTER SENTENCE OF DEATH HAD BEEN PASSED UPON HIM THAT HE HAD BEEN CONVICTED ON A FALSE STATEMENT OF FACTS
LJ018-0047 HE ADHERED TO THIS ALMOST TO THE VERY LAST HIS CASE HAD BEEN WARMLY ESPOUSED BY THE SOCIETY FOR THE PROTECTION OF GERMANS IN THIS COUNTRY
LJ018-0048 AND POWERFUL INFLUENCE WAS EXERTED BOTH HERE AND ABROAD TO OBTAIN A REPRIEVE
LJ018-0049 MÜLLER KNEW THAT ANY CONFESSION WOULD RUIN HIS CHANCES OF ESCAPE
LJ018-0050 HIS ARGUMENTS WERE SPECIOUS AND EVASIVE WHEN PRESSED TO CONFESS. WHY SHOULD MAN CONFESS TO MAN HE REPLIED
LJ018-0051 MAN CANNOT FORGIVE MAN ONLY GOD CAN DO SO. MAN IS THEREFORE ONLY ACCOUNTABLE TO GOD
LJ018-0052 BUT ON THE GALLOWS WHEN THE CAP WAS OVER HIS EYES AND THE ROPE HAD BEEN ADJUSTED ROUND HIS NECK AND WITHIN A SECOND OF THE MOMENT WHEN HE WOULD BE LAUNCHED INTO ETERNITY
LJ018-0053 HE WHISPERED IN THE EAR OF THE GERMAN PASTOR WHO ATTENDED HIM ON THE SCAFFOLD
LJ018-0054 WHILE IN THE CONDEMNED CELL HE CONVERSED FREELY WITH THE WARDERS IN BROKEN ENGLISH OR THROUGH AN INTERPRETER
LJ018-0055 HE IS DESCRIBED AS NOT A BADLOOKING MAN WITH A SQUARE GERMAN TYPE OF FACE
LJ018-0056 BLUE EYES WHICH WERE GENERALLY HALF CLOSED AND VERY FAIR HAIR
LJ018-0057 HE WAS SHORT IN STATURE HIS LEGS WERE LIGHT FOR THE UPPER PART OF HIS BODY WHICH WAS POWERFUL ALMOST HERCULEAN
LJ018-0058 IT IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED THAT HE COMMITTED THE MURDER UNDER A SUDDEN ACCESS OF COVETOUSNESS AND GREED
LJ018-0059 HE SAW MR. BRIGGS' WATCHCHAIN AND FOLLOWED HIM INSTANTLY INTO THE CARRIAGE DETERMINED TO HAVE IT AT ALL COSTS
LJ018-0060 HIS CRIME UNDER THIS ASPECT OF IT WAS LESS PREMEDITATED AND LESS ATROCIOUS THEREFORE THAN THAT OF LEFROY
LJ018-0061 ONE OTHER CURIOUS MURDER MAY BE ADDED TO THE TWO FOREGOING
LJ018-0062 CHRISTIAN SATTLER WAS BY BIRTH A GERMAN
LJ018-0063 HE HAD LED A WILD LIFE HAD LEFT HIS NATIVE LAND AND ENLISTED FIRST IN THE FRENCH ARMY IN ALGERIA
LJ018-0064 AFTERWARDS IN THE BRITISH GERMAN LEGION RAISED FOR THE CRIMEAN WAR
LJ018-0065 AT THE DISBANDMENT OF THE FORCE AS HE WAS WITHOUT RESOURCES HE TURNED HIS ATTENTION TO HOTEL ROBBERIES BY WHICH HE LIVED FOR SOME YEARS
LJ018-0066 HE AT LENGTH STOLE A CARPETBAG CONTAINING VALUABLES AND FLED TO HAMBURGH
LJ018-0067 THITHER HE WAS PURSUED BY A DETECTIVE OFFICER
LJ018-0068 INSPECTOR THAIN WHO BEING UNABLE TO OBTAIN HIS EXTRADITION LEGALLY HAD HIM INVEIGLED ON BOARD AN ENGLISH STEAMER
LJ018-0069 WHERE THE ARREST WAS MADE
LJ018-0070 SATTLER WAS IRONED FOR SAFE CUSTODY
LJ018-0071 A PROCEEDING WHICH HE VEHEMENTLY RESENTED AND BEGGED THAT THEY MIGHT BE REMOVED AS THE HANDCUFFS HURT HIS WRISTS
LJ018-0072 THE INSPECTOR SAID THAT THEY COULD NOT BE REMOVED TILL HE REACHED ENGLAND
LJ018-0073 THIS REPLY OF HIS CONTAINED NO PROMISE OF IMMEDIATE RELEASE
LJ018-0074 SATTLER PROBABLY MISUNDERSTOOD AND HE DECLARED THAT THE POLICE OFFICER HAD BROKEN FAITH WITH HIM HAVING MOREOVER STATED THAT
LJ018-0075 WHILE AT SEA THE CAPTAIN OF THE SHIP WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SECURITY OF THE PRISONER
LJ018-0076 AS SATTLER BROODED OVER HIS WRONGS HIS RAGE GOT THE UPPER HAND AND HE RESOLVED TO WREAK IT UPON THAIN
LJ018-0077 ALTHOUGH MANACLED HE MANAGED TO GET A PISTOL FROM HIS CHEST AND LOAD IT
LJ018-0078 THE NEXT TIME THAIN ENTERED HIS CABIN HE FIRED AT HIM POINTBLANK AND LODGED THREE BULLETS IN HIS BREAST
LJ018-0079 THE UNFORTUNATE MAN SURVIVED TILL HE LANDED BUT DIED IN GUY'S HOSPITAL
LJ018-0080 SATTLER WAS TRIED FOR MURDER AND CONVICTED
LJ018-0081 HIS DEFENSE BEING THAT HE HAD INTENDED TO COMMIT SUICIDE BUT THAT ON THE APPEARANCE OF THIS OFFICER WHO HAD WRONGED HIM
LJ018-0082 HE HAD YIELDED TO AN IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSE TO KILL HIM
LJ018-0083 SATTLER WAS A VERY EXCITABLE ALTHOUGH NOT AN ILLTEMPERED MAN
LJ018-0084 WHILE IN NEWGATE AWAITING TRIAL HE FREQUENTLY TRIED TO JUSTIFY HIS MURDER BY DECLARING THAT THE POLICE OFFICER HAD BROKEN FAITH WITH HIM
LJ018-0085 HE WOULD SHOOT ANY MAN OR ANY POLICEMAN LIKE A DOG OR ANY NUMBER OF THEM WHO HAD TREATED HIM IN THAT WAY
LJ018-0086 HIS DEMEANOR IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING HIS EXECUTION I HAVE REFERRED TO IN THE LAST CHAPTER
LJ018-0087 SEVERAL CASES OF GIGANTIC FRAUD RIVALING ANY ALREADY RECORDED WERE BROUGHT TO LIGHT BETWEEN 1856 AND 1873
LJ018-0088 I PROPOSE NEXT TO DESCRIBE THE LEADING FEATURES OF THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE
LJ018-0089 ANOTHER CASE OF LONGCONTINUED SUCCESSFUL FORGERY WAS BROUGHT TO LIGHT TWO YEARS AFTER THE CONVICTIONS OF SAWARD AND HIS ACCOMPLICES
LJ018-0090 THIS CONSPIRACY WAS CLEVERLY PLANNED BUT HAD SCARCELY SO MANY RAMIFICATIONS AS THAT OF SAWARD. ITS ORIGINATORS WERE A COUPLE OF MEN
LJ018-0091 WAGNER AND BATEMAN WHO HAD ALREADY BEEN CONVICTED OF SYSTEMATIC FORGERY AND SENTENCED TO TRANSPORTATION BUT THEY HAD BEEN RELEASED ON TICKETOFLEAVE
LJ018-0092 IN 1856
LJ018-0093 AS A BLIND FOR THEIR NEW FRAUDS THEY SET UP AS LAWSTATIONERS IN YORK BUILDINGS ADELPHI AND AT ONCE COMMENCED THEIR NEFARIOUS TRAFFIC
LJ018-0094 FORGED CHEQUES AND BILLS WERE SOON UTTERED IN GREAT NUMBERS AS WELL AS BASE COIN
LJ018-0095 THE POLICE SUSPECTING THE HOUSE IN YORK BUILDINGS PUT A WATCH ON THE PREMISES WHICH THEY KEPT UP FOR MORE THAN A YEAR
LJ018-0096 AND THUS OBTAINED PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF ALL WHO PASSED IN AND OUT BUT WITHOUT OBTAINING ANY DIRECT EVIDENCE
LJ018-0097 AT LENGTH A MAN WAS CAUGHT IN THE ACT OF PASSING A FORGED CHEQUE AT THE UNION BANK
LJ018-0098 AND RECOGNIZED AS ONE OF THE FREQUENTERS OF THE BOGUS LAWSTATIONERS. HIS ARREST LED TO THAT OF OTHERS
LJ018-0099 AMONG THEM WAS A MAN NAMED CHANDLER FORMERLY A BILL DISCOUNTER BY PROFESSION WHO BY DEGREES TO MEET HIS EXTRAVAGANT EXPENDITURE
LJ018-0100 TOOK TO APPROPRIATING THE BILLS INTRUSTED TO HIM AND SO LOST HIS BUSINESS AFTER WHICH HE BECAME A CLERK TO MESSRS. WAGNER AND BATEMAN
LJ018-0101 CHANDLER WHILE IN NEWGATE TURNED INFORMER AND BETRAYED THE WHOLE CONSPIRACY
LJ018-0102 BESIDES HIS EMPLOYERS A JEWELER NAMED HUMPHREYS WAS IN THE SWIM AT WHOSE SHOP IN RED LION SQUARE WAS DISCOVERED A QUANTITY OF BASE GOLD
LJ018-0103 AND SILVER COINS WITH ALL THE LATEST APPLIANCES FOR COINING INCLUDING THOSE OF ELECTROPLATING
LJ018-0104 ALSO A FURNITURE DEALER AND ONE OR TWO MORE COMMONPLACE ROGUES. THE ARCH VILLAIN WAS NEVER TAKEN INTO CUSTODY
LJ018-0105 HE LIKE SAWARD WAS AN ARTIST IN PENMANSHIP
LJ018-0106 HE WAS A GERMAN NAMED KERP
LJ018-0107 EIGHTY YEARS OF AGE WHO HAD SPENT HIS WHOLE LIFE IN IMITATING OTHER PEOPLE'S SIGNATURES AND HAD ACQUIRED THE MOST CONSUMMATE SKILL IN THE PRACTICE
LJ018-0108 HIS COPIES WERE GENERALLY PRONOUNCED INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM AND AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINALS
LJ018-0109 THE AGED BUT WARY KERP THE MOMENT THE PLOT WAS DISCOVERED VANISHED AND WAS NEVER MORE HEARD OF
LJ018-0110 MUCH THE SAME PLAN WAS ADOPTED BY THESE FORGERS AS BY SAWARD TO GET THEIR CHEQUES CASHED
LJ018-0111 THEY ADVERTISED FOR CLERKS AND EMPLOYED THE MOST LIKELY OF THE APPLICANTS BY SENDING THEM TO THE BANK
LJ018-0112 IT WAS ONE OF THESE GLENDINNING WHO HAD ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE UTILIZED FOR SOME TIME IN THIS WAY WHOSE CAPTURE LED TO THE BREAKING UP OF THE GANG
LJ018-0113 THE PRINCIPALS IN THIS CONSPIRACY WAGNER AND BATEMAN WERE SENTENCED TO PENAL SERVITUDE FOR LIFE
LJ018-0114 THE OTHERS TO TWENTY AND TEN YEARS
LJ018-0115 IT WAS STATED IN EVIDENCE THAT THE MONIES OBTAINED BY THESE FORGERIES AMOUNTED TO £8000 OR £10000
LJ018-0116 AND THAT THE FORGED CHEQUES WHICH HAD BEEN PRESENTED BUT REFUSED AMOUNTED TO DOUBLE THE SUM
LJ018-0117 WAGNER AFTER CONVICTION OFFERED TO REVEAL FOR A REWARD OF £3000
LJ018-0118 A SYSTEM WHICH HAD LONG BEEN IN PRACTICE OF DEFRAUDING THE EXCHEQUER OF VAST SUMS BY MEANS OF FORGED STAMPS
LJ018-0119 HIS OFFER WAS NOT HOWEVER ACCEPTED
LJ018-0120 A MORE ELABORATE PLOT IN MANY WAYS MORE SECRETLY MORE PATIENTLY PREPARED THAN THE PRECEDING OR INDEED THAN ANY IN THE CALENDAR
LJ018-0121 WAS THE CASE OF THE FORGERIES UPON THE BANK OF ENGLAND DISCOVERED IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ018-0122 BUT NOT BEFORE THE FORGED PAPER HAD BEEN PUT IN CIRCULATION FOR MORE THAN A COUPLE OF YEARS. IN 1861
LJ018-0123 A MAN NAMED BURNETT CAME WITH HIS WIFE AND TOOK UP HIS RESIDENCE AT WHITCHURCH HAMPSHIRE AT NO GREAT DISTANCE FROM LAVERSTOCK
LJ018-0124 WHERE ARE MESSRS. PORTAL'S MILLS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF BANKNOTE PAPER
LJ018-0125 BURNETT HAD ONLY JUST COME OUT OF JAIL AFTER COMPLETING A SENTENCE OF PENAL SERVITUDE
LJ018-0126 HIS OBJECT IN VISITING WHITCHURCH WAS TO UNDERMINE THE HONESTY OF SOME WORKMAN IN THE MILLS
LJ018-0127 AND HE EVENTUALLY SUCCEEDED HIS WIFE MAKING THE FIRST OVERTURES IN PERSUADING A LAD NAMED BROWN TO STEAL SOME OF THE BANK PAPER
LJ018-0128 BROWN TOOK SEVERAL SHEETS AND THEN WAS DETECTED BY BREWER A FELLOWWORKMAN OF SUPERIOR GRADE
LJ018-0129 WHO THREATENED TO BETRAY THE THEFT. BUT BREWER EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER THIS SUCCUMBED TO TEMPTATION
LJ018-0130 AND STOLE PAPER ON A MUCH LARGER SCALE THAN BROWN
LJ018-0131 ALL THAT WAS TAKEN WAS HANDED OVER TO BURNETT OR A WOMAN IN BLACK WHOM BROWN MET BY APPOINTMENT AT WATERLOO STATION
LJ018-0132 TO FACILITATE HIS OPERATIONS BREWER OBTAINED A FALSE MASTER KEY FROM BURNETT
LJ018-0133 WHICH GAVE HIM ACCESS TO ALL PARTS OF THE MILLS THE PACKINGROOM INCLUDED
LJ018-0134 IN THIS PART OF THE MILLS A LARGE QUANTITY OF BANKNOTE PAPER WAS KEPT AT THE PERIOD OF THE ROBBERY
LJ018-0135 AND IN THE STATES KNOWN AS WATERLEAF AND SIZED WHICH ARE THE PENULTIMATE PROCESSES OF MANUFACTURE
LJ018-0136 ONE MORE REMAINS THAT OF GLAZING WITHOUT WHICH NO PAPER IS ISSUED FOR ENGRAVING
LJ018-0137 NONE OF THE STOLEN PAPER WAS GLAZED AND THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT CLUE TO THE SUBSEQUENT DISCOVERY OF THE CRIME
LJ018-0138 SOME TIME IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO A LARGE DEFICIENCY IN STOCK OF BANK PAPER UNGLAZED WAS DISCOVERED AT THE MILLS
LJ018-0139 SOON AFTERWARDS THE INSPECTORS OF BANKNOTES AT THE BANK OF ENGLAND DETECTED THE PRESENTATION AT THE BANK OF SPURIOUS NOTES ON GENUINE PAPER
LJ018-0140 THE TWO FACTS TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION
LJ018-0141 LED TO THE EMPLOYMENT OF THE POLICE AND THE OFFER OF A REWARD OF £1500 FOR THE DETECTION OF THE OFFENDERS
LJ018-0142 BY THIS TIME BROWN ALONE HAD STOLEN THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED SHEETS
LJ018-0143 EACH CONTAINING TWO NOTES MANY OF THE SHEETS SUITABLE FOR ENGRAVING ANY KIND OF NOTE FROM £1000 DOWNWARDS
LJ018-0144 THE AMOUNT OF BREWER'S ABSTRACTIONS WHO WAS EVENTUALLY ACQUITTED WAS NEVER EXACTLY ESTIMATED
LJ018-0145 SUSPICION APPEARS TO HAVE RESTED ON BROWN WHO HAD LEFT LAVERSTOCK
LJ018-0146 AND HE WAS SOON APPROACHED BY THE POLICE. ALMOST DIRECTLY HE WAS QUESTIONED HE MADE A CLEAN BREAST OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR
LJ018-0147 THE NEXT STEP WAS TO TAKE THE PRINCIPALS AND UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES AS WOULD INSURE THEIR CONVICTION
LJ018-0148 A WATCH WAS SET ON BURNETT WHO WAS FOLLOWED TO THE SHOP OF ONE BUNCHER A BUTCHER IN STRUTTON GROUND
LJ018-0149 BUNCHER WAS THEN TRACKED TO NORTH KENT TERRACE NEW CROSS WHERE A MR. AND MRS. CAMPBELL RESIDED
LJ018-0150 WITH WHOM HE DID BUSINESS IN EXCHANGING THE FALSE NOTES
LJ018-0151 THE POLICE OFFICERS NOW TAXED MRS. CAMPBELL WITH COMPLICITY AND FRIGHTENED HER INTO COLLUSION
LJ018-0152 WITH HER ASSISTANCE ON A CERTAIN DAY A COUPLE OF BRICKS WERE TAKEN OUT OF THE WALL DIVIDING HER FRONT AND BACK PARLORS
LJ018-0153 THE OFFICERS ENSCONCED THEMSELVES IN THE LATTER AND WAITED FOR BUNCHER'S EXPECTED VISIT
LJ018-0154 HE CAME TO COMPLETE A SALE OF FORGED NOTES AND HE WANTED A COUPLE OF HUNDRED POUNDS FOR WHAT HE HAD
LJ018-0155 MRS. CAMPBELL OFFERED HIM LESS AND THERE WAS AN ALTERCATION IN THE COURSE OF WHICH BUNCHER BECAME VERY VIOLENT AND AT LENGTH
LJ018-0156 AFTER USING MUCH INTEMPERATE LANGUAGE HE LEFT THE PLACE IN A HUFF
LJ018-0157 IN THE COURSE OF HIS REMARKS HOWEVER HE SAID
LJ018-0158 I AM THE MAN THAT HAS GOT ALL THE BANK PAPER I HAVE £30000 NOW AND THE BANK OF ENGLAND CANNOT STOP IT
LJ018-0159 THIS WAS ALL THE POLICE WANTED TO KNOW
LJ018-0160 THEY NEXT WATCHED BUNCHER AND FOUND THAT HE PAID FREQUENT VISITS TO BIRMINGHAM
LJ018-0161 THEY ALSO DISCOVERED THAT THROUGH THE INTERMEDIACY OF ONE ROBERT CUMMINGS WELL KNOWN AS A REPUTED COINER
LJ018-0162 HE HAD BEEN INTRODUCED TO A MAN NAMED GRIFFITHS AN ENGRAVER AND COPPERPLATE PRINTER
LJ018-0163 GRIFFITHS WAS AN UNUSUALLY CLEVER AND SKILFUL WORKMAN
LJ018-0164 WHO HAD DEVOTED ALL HIS TALENT AND ALL HIS ENERGIES FOR SOME SEVENTEEN YEARS TO THE FABRICATION OF FALSE BANKNOTES
LJ018-0165 ON A CERTAIN DAY THE 27TH OCTOBER EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO THE TWO WERE ARRESTED SIMULTANEOUSLY
LJ018-0166 BUNCHER IN LONDON AND GRIFFITHS IN BIRMINGHAM
LJ018-0167 NOTHING WAS FOUND IN BUNCHER'S PREMISES IN STRUTTON GROUND WHICH WERE THOROUGHLY SEARCHED
LJ018-0168 BUT PROOFS OF GRIFFITHS' GUILT WERE AT ONCE APPARENT ON ENTERING HIS WORKROOM
LJ018-0169 IN ONE CORNER WAS A PRINTINGPRESS ACTUALLY IN USE AND ON IT WERE TWENTYONE FORGED BANK OF ENGLAND NOTES WITHOUT DATE OR SIGNATURE
LJ018-0170 ON THE BED WERE TWENTY FORGED TENPOUND NOTES COMPLETE AND READY FOR USE AND TWENTYFIVE FIVEPOUND NOTES
LJ018-0171 MOTHER PLATES FOR ENGRAVING THE BODY OF THE NOTES LAY ABOUT AND OTHER PLATES FOR VARIOUS PROCESSES
LJ018-0172 MORE THAN THIS GRIFFITHS TOOK THE POLICE TO A FIELD WHERE IN A BANK A NUMBER OF OTHER PLATES WERE SECRETED
LJ018-0173 GRIFFITHS AFTERWARDS ADMITTED THAT HE HAD BEEN EMPLOYED IN DEFRAUDING THE BANK SINCE EIGHTEEN FORTY SIX
LJ018-0174 AND THE PROMINENT PART HE PLAYED SECURED FOR HIM ON CONVICTION THE HEAVIEST SENTENCE OF THE LAW
LJ018-0175 THIS WAS PENAL SERVITUDE FOR LIFE BUNCHER'S SENTENCE BEING TWENTYFIVE AND BURNETT'S TWENTY YEARS
LJ018-0176 CUMMINGS WHO HAD INTRODUCED BUNCHER TO GRIFFITHS WAS ALSO TRIED FOR BEING IN POSSESSION OF STOLEN BANK PAPER FOR IMPROPER PURPOSES
LJ018-0177 BUT AS THERE WAS NO INDEPENDENT CORROBORATION OF THE INFORMER'S EVIDENCE ACCORDING TO THE CUSTOM OF THE BRITISH LAW
LJ018-0178 THE CASE WAS CONSIDERED NOT PROVED AND HE WAS ACQUITTED
LJ018-0179 ON HIS RETURN TO NEWGATE TO BE FINALLY DISCHARGED CUMMINGS JUMPED UP THE STAIRS AND FAIRLY DANCED FOR JOY
LJ018-0180 BUT HE WAS NOT LONG AT LARGE HE WAS TOO ACTIVE AN EVILDOER
LJ018-0181 AND WAS PERPETUALLY IN TROUBLE. COMMENCING LIFE AS A RESURRECTION MAN WHEN THAT TRADE FAILED THROUGH THE CHANGE IN THE LAW
LJ018-0182 AND NO MORE BODIES WERE TO BE BOUGHT
LJ018-0183 HE DEVOTED HIS ENERGIES TO COINING AND FORGERY AND IN THE LATTER LINE WAS A FRIEND AND ASSOCIATE OF SAWARD'S
LJ018-0184 ONE NARROW ESCAPE HE HAD HOWEVER BEFORE HE ABANDONED HIS OLD BUSINESS
LJ018-0185 A BOW STREET OFFICER SAW HIM LEAVING LONDON IN THE EVENING BY CAMBERWELL GREEN ACCOMPANIED BY TWO OTHER MEN
LJ018-0186 IT WAS WELL KNOWN THAT THEY WERE RESURRECTIONISTS AND A STRICT WATCH WAS KEPT AT ALL THE TURNPIKE GATES ON THE SOUTHERN ROADS LEADING INTO LONDON
LJ018-0187 AN OFFICER WAS PLACED FOR THIS PURPOSE AT NEW CROSS CAMBERWELL AND KENNINGTON GATES
LJ018-0188 PRESENTLY OLD BOB DROVE UP TO CAMBERWELL GATE IN THE SAME CART IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN SEEN TO START
LJ018-0189 THE OFFICERS RUSHED OUT TO DETAIN HIM. WHAT HAVE YOU GOT HERE WE MUST SEARCH THE CART THEY CRY
LJ018-0190 BY ALL MEANS REPLIES BOB AND A CLOSE INVESTIGATION FOLLOWS WITHOUT ANY DETECTION OF THE CORPSE CONCEALED
LJ018-0191 BOB WAS THEREFORE ALLOWED TO PASS ON
LJ018-0192 BUT THEY HAD THE BODY ALL THE SAME IT HAD BEEN DRESSED UP IN DECENT CLOTHES AND MADE TO STAND UPRIGHT IN THE CART
LJ018-0193 WITH THE POLICE OFFICERS IT HAD PASSED MUSTER AS A LIVING MEMBER OF THE PARTY
LJ018-0194 CUMMINGS WAS REPEATEDLY RUN IN FOR THE OFFENSE OF COINING AND UTTERING BAD MONEY WHETHER COIN OR NOTES
LJ018-0195 HIS REGULAR TRADE FOLLOWED BEFORE HE TOOK TO THE LIFE OF RESURRECTIONIST WAS THAT OF AN ENGRAVER
LJ018-0196 HE WAS A NOTORIOUS CRIMINAL
LJ018-0197 AN HABITUAL OFFENDER IN HIS OWN PARTICULAR LINE ONE WHO WOULD STICK AT NO TRIFLES TO EVADE DETECTION OR ESCAPE CAPTURE
LJ018-0198 IT IS TOLD OF BOB BRENNAN AN OFFICIAL SPECIALLY EMPLOYED FOR YEARS BY THE MINT
LJ018-0199 TO WATCH AND PROSECUTE COINERS THAT HE RECEIVED INFORMATION THAT COINING WAS CARRIED ON BY CUMMINGS AND OTHERS AT A PLACE IN WESTMINSTER
LJ018-0200 HE WENT THERE WITH A POSSE OF OFFICERS AND FORCED HIS WAY UPSTAIRS TO THE FIRST FLOOR
LJ018-0201 WHERE THE COINERS UNEXPECTEDLY DISTURBED FELL AN EASY PREY
LJ018-0202 BUT THE POLICE NEARLY PAID THE PENALTY OF CAPTURE WITH THEIR LIVES
LJ018-0203 PROCEEDING CAUTIOUSLY DOWN THE STAIRS THEY FOUND THAT THE FLOORING AT THE BOTTOM HAD BEEN TAKEN UP
LJ018-0204 WHERE IT HAD LAIN WAS A YAWNING GULF OR TRAP SUFFICIENT TO DO FOR THE WHOLE BODY OF POLICE ENGAGED IN THE CAPTURE
LJ018-0205 CUMMINGS WAS CAUGHT SHORTLY AFTERWARDS
LJ018-0206 HE WAS A TALL SLENDER MAN WITH A LONG FACE AND IRONGRAY HAIR
LJ018-0207 THE COMMUNITY OF COINERS OF WHICH HE WAS SO NOTORIOUS A MEMBER
LJ018-0208 WERE A LOW LOT THE LOWEST AMONG CRIMINALS EXCEPT PERHAPS THE 'SMASHERS' OR THOSE WHO PASSED THE COUNTERFEIT MONEY
LJ018-0209 IT WAS NOT EASY TO DETECT COINERS OR BRING HOME THEIR GUILT TO THEM
LJ018-0210 THOSE WHO MANUFACTURED AND THOSE WHO PASSED HAD NO DIRECT DEALINGS WITH EACH OTHER
LJ018-0211 THE FALSE COIN WAS BOUGHT BY AN AGENT FROM AN AGENT AND DEALINGS WERE CARRIED ON SECRETLY AT THE CLOCK HOUSE IN SEVEN DIALS
LJ018-0212 THE ANNALS OF FRAUDULENT CRIME PROBABLY CONTAIN NOTHING
LJ018-0213 WHICH IN DRAMATIC INTEREST CAN COMPARE WITH THE CONVICTION OF WILLIAM ROUPELL FOR FORGERY
LJ018-0214 AS THE CASE MUST STILL BE WELL REMEMBERED BY THE PRESENT GENERATION IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO GIVE HERE ONLY THE BRIEFEST SUMMARY
LJ018-0215 WILLIAM ROUPELL WAS THE ELDEST BUT ILLEGITIMATE SON OF A WEALTHY MAN WHO SUBSEQUENTLY MARRIED ROUPELL'S MOTHER AND HAD FURTHER LEGITIMATE ISSUE
LJ018-0216 WILLIAM WAS BROUGHT UP AS AN ATTORNEY AND BECAME IN DUE COURSE HIS FATHER'S MAN OF BUSINESS
LJ018-0217 AS SUCH HE HAD PRETTY GENERAL CONTROL OVER HIS FATHER'S ESTATES AND AFFAIRS
LJ018-0218 IN 1855
LJ018-0219 HE INSTRUCTED CERTAIN SOLICITORS TO PREPARE A DEED OF GIFT AS FROM HIS FATHER CONVEYING TO HIM ESTATES NEAR KINGSTON
LJ018-0220 THE OLD GENTLEMAN'S SIGNATURE TO THIS DEED OF GIFT WAS A FORGERY
LJ018-0221 BUT UPON THIS FORGED AND FALSE CONVEYANCE WILLIAM ROUPELL WHO HAD ALREADY EMBARKED UPON A CAREER OF WILD EXTRAVAGANCE
LJ018-0222 OBTAINED A MORTGAGE OF £7000
LJ018-0223 IN 1856 THE FATHER DIED
LJ018-0224 IT HAD BEEN SUPPOSED UP TO THIS DATE THAT HE HAD WILLED HIS PROPERTY AMOUNTING IN ALL TO UPWARDS OF £200000
LJ018-0225 BUT AFTER THE FUNERAL WILLIAM ROUPELL PRODUCED ANOTHER AND A LATER WILL
LJ018-0226 LEAVING EVERYTHING TO THE WIDOW AND CONSTITUTING WILLIAM SOLE EXECUTOR
LJ018-0227 THIS WILL WAS A DELIBERATE FORGERY
LJ018-0228 FIVE OR SIX YEARS LATER WILLIAM ROUPELL MINUTELY DESCRIBED HOW HE HAD EFFECTED THE FRAUD
LJ018-0229 THE DAY HIS FATHER DIED HE GOT THE KEYS OF HIS PRIVATE BUREAU OPENED IT AND TOOK OUT THE AUTHENTIC WILL
LJ018-0230 AFTER READING IT AND FINDING THIS UNFAVORABLE TO HIMSELF HE RESOLVED TO CARRY OUT HIS DELIBERATE PLAN
LJ018-0231 NAMELY TO SUPPRESS IT AND SUBSTITUTE ANOTHER
LJ018-0232 HE HIMSELF PREPARED IT ON A BLANK FORM WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM ON PURPOSE
LJ018-0233 TO THIS FRAUDULENT INSTRUMENT HE APPENDED FORGED SIGNATURES AND IN DUE COURSE OBTAINED PROBATE
LJ018-0234 AS HE POSSESSED NEARLY UNBOUNDED INFLUENCE OVER HIS MOTHER HER ACCESSION TO THE PROPERTY MEANT THAT WILLIAM COULD DISPOSE OF IT AS HE PLEASED
LJ018-0235 HE EMBARKED FORTHWITH IN A CAREER OF THE WILDEST EXTRAVAGANCE AND ERE LONG HE HAD PARTED IN HIS MOTHER'S NAME WITH MOST OF THE LANDED ESTATES
LJ018-0236 ONE LARGE ITEM OF HIS EXPENDITURE WAS A CONTESTED ELECTION AT LAMBETH WHICH HE GAINED AT A COST OF £10000
LJ018-0237 NO FORTUNE COULD STAND THE INROADS HE MADE INTO HIS MOTHER'S MONEY
LJ018-0238 AND IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO HE WAS OBLIGED TO FLY THE COUNTRY HOPELESSLY AND IRRETRIEVABLY RUINED
LJ018-0239 HIS DISAPPEARANCE GAVE COLOR AND SUBSTANCE TO EVIL REPORTS ALREADY IN CIRCULATION THAT THE WILL AND CONVEYANCE ABOVE REFERRED TO
LJ018-0240 WERE FICTITIOUS DOCUMENTS. HIS NEXT BROTHER WHO SHOULD HAVE INHERITED UNDER THE AUTHENTIC WILL
LJ018-0241 FORTHWITH BROUGHT AN EJECTMENT ON THE POSSESSOR OF LANDS PURCHASED ON THE AUTHORITY OF THE FORGED CONVEYANCE AND WILL
LJ018-0242 THE CASE WAS TRIED AT GUILDFORD ASSIZES AND CAUSED INTENSE EXCITEMENT
LJ018-0243 THE HARDSHIP TO THE HOLDERS OF THESE LANDS BEING PLAIN SHOULD THE ALLEGATIONS OF INVALIDITY BE MADE GOOD
LJ018-0244 THE EFFECT OF ESTABLISHING THE FORGERIES WOULD BE TO RESTORE TO THE ROUPELL FAMILY LANDS FOR WHICH A PRICE HAD ALREADY BEEN PAID
LJ018-0245 IN ALL GOOD FAITH TO ANOTHER BUT A CRIMINAL MEMBER OF THE FAMILY
LJ018-0246 AT FIRST THE CASE WAS CONTESTED HOTLY BUT TO THE PROFOUND ASTONISHMENT OF EVERY ONE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE COURT
LJ018-0247 WILLIAM ROUPELL HIMSELF WAS BROUGHT AS A PRINCIPAL WITNESS TO CLENCH THE CASE BY A CONFESSION ALTOGETHER AGAINST HIMSELF
LJ018-0248 HE TOLD HIS STORY WITH PERFECT COOLNESS AND SELFPOSSESSION BUT IN A GRAVE AND SERIOUS TONE
LJ018-0249 EVERY WORD HE UTTERED WAS SAID WITH CONSIDERATION AND SOMETIMES WITH A LONG PAUSE
LJ018-0250 BUT AT THE SAME TIME WITH AN AIR OF THE MOST ENTIRE TRUTHFULNESS AND CANDOR
LJ018-0251 HE CONFESSED HIMSELF A PERJURER IN HAVING SWORN TO THE FALSE WILL AND A WHOLESALE FORGER HAVING MANUFACTURED NO LESS THAN TEN FALSE SIGNATURES
LJ018-0252 TO DEEDS INVOLVING ON THE WHOLE SOME £350000
LJ018-0253 FOR THESE CRIMES WILLIAM ROUPELL WAS TRIED AT THE CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT ON THE 24TH SEPTEMBER EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO
LJ018-0254 HE DECLINED TO PLEAD BUT A PLEA OF NOT GUILTY WAS RECORDED
LJ018-0255 THE CASE WAS EASILY AND RAPIDLY DISPOSED OF
LJ018-0256 ROUPELL MADE A LONG STATEMENT MORE IN EXCULPATION THAN IN HIS DEFENSE
LJ018-0257 HE COMPLAINED THAT HE HAD AT FIRST BEEN THE DUPE OF OTHERS AND ADMITTED THAT HE HAD TOO READILY FALLEN ASTRAY
LJ018-0258 BUT WHILE REPUDIATING THE CHARGES MADE AGAINST HIM OF SYSTEMATIC EXTRAVAGANCE AND IMMORALITY
LJ018-0259 HE CONFESSED THAT HIS WHOLE LIFE HAD BEEN A GIGANTIC MISTAKE AND HE WAS READY TO MAKE WHAT ATONEMENT HE COULD
LJ018-0260 MR. JUSTICE BYLES IN PASSING SENTENCE COMMENTED SEVERELY UPON THE COMMISSION OF SUCH CRIMES BY A MAN IN ROUPELL'S POSITION IN LIFE
LJ018-0261 AND PASSED THE HEAVIEST SENTENCE OF THE LAW TRANSPORTATION FOR LIFE
LJ018-0262 ROUPELL RECEIVED THE ANNOUNCEMENT WITH A CHEERFUL COUNTENANCE
LJ018-0263 AND LEFT THE DOCK WITH EVIDENT SATISFACTION AND RELIEF AT THE TERMINATION OF A MOST PAINFUL ORDEAL
LJ018-0264 ROUPELL WAS QUIET AND SUBMISSIVE WHILE IN NEWGATE UNASSUMING IN MANNER AND READY TO MAKE THE BEST OF HIS POSITION
LJ018-0265 HE CARRIED THIS CHARACTER WITH HIM INTO PENAL SERVITUDE AND AFTER ENDURING THE FULL SEVERITY OF HIS PUNISHMENT FOR SEVERAL YEARS
LJ018-0266 WAS AT LENGTH ADVANCED TO THE COMPARATIVE EASE OF A POST MUCH COVETED BY CONVICTS THAT OF HOSPITAL NURSE
LJ018-0267 HIS UNIFORM GOOD CONDUCT GAINED HIM RELEASE FROM PORTLAND ON TICKETOFLEAVE IN 1882 JUST TWENTY YEARS AFTER HIS CONVICTION
LJ018-0268 A DARING AND CLEVERLYPLANNED ROBBERY OF DIAMONDS WAS THAT OF THE TARPEYS MAN AND WIFE
LJ018-0269 FROM AN ASSISTANT OF LOUDON AND RYDER'S THE JEWELERS IN BOND STREET. THE TRICK WAS AN OLD ONE
LJ018-0270 THE ASSISTANT CALLED WITH THE JEWELS ON APPROBATION AT A HOUSE SPECIALLY HIRED FOR THE PURPOSE IN THE WEST END
LJ018-0271 AND WAS RENDERED INSENSIBLE BY CHLOROFORM AFTER WHICH HE WAS BOUND AND THE PRECIOUS STONES STOLEN
LJ018-0272 MRS. TARPEY WAS ALMOST IMMEDIATELY CAPTURED AND PUT ON HER TRIAL BUT SHE WAS ACQUITTED ON THE PLEA THAT SHE HAD ACTED UNDER THE COERCION OF HER HUSBAND
LJ018-0273 TARPEY WAS CAUGHT THROUGH HIS WIFE
LJ018-0274 WHO WAS FOLLOWED DISGUISED AND WITH HER HAIR DYED BLACK TO A HOUSE IN THE MARYLEBONE ROAD WHERE SHE MET HER HUSBAND
LJ018-0275 ON TARPEY'S DEFENSE IT WAS STATED THAT THE IDEA OF THE THEFT HAD BEEN SUGGESTED TO HIM BY A NOVEL AT A TIME HE HAD LOST LARGELY ON THE TURF
LJ018-0276 THE FIRST PLOT WAS AGAINST MR. HARRY EMMANUEL BUT HE ESCAPED AND THE ATTEMPT WAS MADE UPON LOUDON AND RYDER
LJ018-0277 THE LAST GREAT CASE OF FRAUD UPON THE BANK OF ENGLAND WILL FITLY CLOSE THIS BRANCH OF THE CRIMINAL RECORDS OF NEWGATE
LJ018-0278 THIS WAS THE WELL AND ASTUTELY DEVISED PLOT OF THE BROTHERS BIDWELL
LJ018-0279 ASSISTED BY MACDONELL AND NOYES ALL OF THEM CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES BY WHICH THE BANK LOST UPWARDS OF £100000
LJ018-0280 THE COMMERCIAL EXPERIENCE OF THESE CLEVER ROGUES WAS COSMOPOLITAN
LJ018-0281 THEIR OPERATIONS WERE NO LESS WORLDWIDE
LJ018-0282 IN 1871 THEY CROSSED THE ATLANTIC
LJ018-0283 AND BY MEANS OF FORGED LETTERS OF CREDIT AND INTRODUCTION FROM LONDON OBTAINED LARGE SUMS FROM CONTINENTAL BANKS IN BERLIN
LJ018-0284 DRESDEN BORDEAUX MARSEILLES AND LYONS
LJ018-0285 WITH THIS AS CAPITAL THEY CAME BACK TO ENGLAND VIA BUENOS AIRES
LJ018-0286 AND AUSTIN BIDWELL OPENED A BONA FIDE CREDIT IN THE BURLINGTON OR WEST END BRANCH OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND
LJ018-0287 TO WHICH HE WAS INTRODUCED BY A WELLKNOWN TAILOR IN SAVILLE ROW
LJ018-0288 AFTER THIS THE OTHER CONSPIRATORS TRAVELED TO OBTAIN GENUINE BILLS AND MASTER THE SYSTEM OF THE LEADING HOUSES AT HOME AND ABROAD
LJ018-0289 WHEN ALL WAS READY BIDWELL FIRST REFRESHED HIS CREDIT AT THE BANK OF ENGLAND AS WELL AS DISARMED SUSPICION
LJ018-0290 BY PAYING IN A GENUINE BILL OF MESSRS. ROTHSCHILDS' FOR £4500 WHICH WAS DULY DISCOUNTED
LJ018-0291 THEN HE EXPLAINED TO THE BANK MANAGER
LJ018-0292 THAT HIS TRANSACTIONS AT BIRMINGHAM WOULD SHORTLY BE VERY LARGE OWING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIS BUSINESS THERE IN THE ALLEGED MANUFACTURE OF PULLMAN CARS
LJ018-0293 THE GROUND THUS CLEARED THE FORGERS POURED IN FROM BIRMINGHAM NUMBERS OF FORGED ACCEPTANCES
LJ018-0294 ALL OF WHICH WERE DISCOUNTED TO THE VALUE OF £102217
LJ018-0295 THE FRAUD WAS RENDERED POSSIBLE BY THE ABSENCE OF A CHECK USUAL IN THE UNITED STATES
LJ018-0296 THERE SUCH BILLS WOULD BE SENT TO THE DRAWER TO BE INITIALED AND THE FORGERY WOULD HAVE BEEN AT ONCE DETECTED
LJ018-0297 IT WAS THE DISCOVERY OF THIS FLAW IN THE BANKING SYSTEM WHICH HAD ENCOURAGED THE AMERICANS TO ATTEMPT THIS CRIME
LJ018-0298 TIME WAS CLEARLY AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE FRAUD HENCE THE BILLS WERE SENT FORWARD IN QUICK SUCCESSION
LJ018-0299 LONG BEFORE THEY CAME TO MATURITY THE FORGERS HOPED TO BE WELL BEYOND ARREST. THEY HAD MOREOVER SOUGHT TO DESTROY ALL CLUE
LJ018-0300 THE SUMS OBTAINED BY BIDWELL IN THE NAME OF WARREN AT THE BANK OF ENGLAND
LJ018-0301 WERE LODGED AT ONCE BY DRAFTS TO HORTON ANOTHER ALIAS IN THE CONTINENTAL BANK
LJ018-0302 FOR THESE CASH WAS OBTAINED IN NOTES THE NOTES WERE EXCHANGED BY ONE OF THE CONSPIRATORS FOR GOLD AT THE BANK OF ENGLAND AND AGAIN THE SAME DAY
LJ018-0303 A SECOND CONSPIRATOR EXCHANGED THE GOLD FOR NOTES. BUT JUST AS ALL PROMISED WELL THE FRAUDS WERE DETECTED THROUGH THE CARELESSNESS OF THE FORGERS
LJ018-0304 THEY HAD OMITTED TO INSERT THE DATES IN CERTAIN BILLS
LJ018-0305 THE BILLS WERE SENT AS A MATTER OF FORM TO THE DRAWER TO HAVE THE DATE ADDED AND THE FORGERY WAS AT ONCE DETECTED
LJ018-0306 NOYES WAS SEIZED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY AS IT WAS A PART OF THE SCHEME THAT HE SHOULD ACT AS THE DUPE AND REMAIN ON THE SPOT IN LONDON TILL ALL THE MONEY WAS OBTAINED
LJ018-0307 THROUGH NOYES THE REST OF THE CONSPIRATORS WERE EVENTUALLY APPREHENDED. VERY LITTLE IF ANY OF THE ILLGOTTEN PROCEEDS HOWEVER WAS EVER RECOVERED
LJ018-0308 LARGE SUMS AS THEY WERE REALIZED WERE TRANSMITTED TO THE UNITED STATES AND INVESTED IN VARIOUS AMERICAN SECURITIES
LJ018-0309 WHERE PROBABLY THE MONEY STILL REMAINS
LJ018-0310 THE PRISONERS WHO WERE COMMITTED TO NEWGATE FOR TRIAL
LJ018-0311 HAD UNDOUBTEDLY THE COMMAND OF LARGE FUNDS WHILE THERE AND WOULD HAVE READILY DISBURSED IT TO EFFECT THEIR ENLARGEMENT
LJ018-0312 A PLOT WAS SOON DISCOVERED
LJ018-0313 DEEP LAID AND WITH MANY RAMIFICATIONS BY WHICH SOME OF THE NEWGATE WARDERS WERE TO BE BRIBED TO ALLOW THE PRISONERS TO ESCAPE FROM THEIR CELLS AT NIGHT
LJ018-0314 CERTAIN FRIENDS OF THE PRISONERS WERE WATCHED AND FOUND TO BE IN COMMUNICATION WITH THESE WARDERS
LJ018-0315 TO WHOM IT WAS SAID £100 APIECE HAD BEEN GIVEN DOWN AS THE PRICE OF THEIR INFIDELITY
LJ018-0316 FURTHER SUMS WERE TO HAVE BEEN PAID AFTER THE ESCAPE
LJ018-0317 AND ONE WARDER ADMITTED THAT HE WAS TO HAVE £1000 MORE PAID TO HIM AND TO BE PROVIDED WITH A PASSAGE TO AUSTRALIA
LJ018-0318 THE VIGILANCE OF THE NEWGATE OFFICIALS ASSISTED BY THE CITY POLICE COMPLETELY FRUSTRATED THIS PLOT
LJ018-0319 A SECOND WAS NEVERTHELESS SET ON FOOT
LJ018-0320 IN WHICH THE PLAN OF ACTION WAS CHANGED AND THE FREEDOM OF THE PRISONERS WAS TO BE OBTAINED BY MEANS OF A RESCUE FROM THE DOCK DURING THE TRIAL
LJ018-0321 AN INCREASE OF POLICEMEN ON DUTY SUFFICED TO PREVENT ANY ATTEMPT OF THIS KIND
LJ018-0322 NOR WERE THESE TWO ABORTIVE EFFORTS ALL THAT WERE PLANNED
LJ018-0323 A YEAR OR TWO AFTER WHEN THE PRISONERS WERE UNDERGOING THEIR LIFE SENTENCES OF PENAL SERVITUDE
LJ018-0324 MUCH UNEASINESS WAS CAUSED AT ONE OF THE CONVICT PRISONS BY INFORMATION THAT BRIBERY ON A LARGE SCALE WAS AGAIN AT WORK AMONGST THE OFFICIALS
LJ018-0325 BUT EXTRA PRECAUTIONS AND CLOSE SUPERVISION HAVE SO FAR PROVED EFFECTUAL AND THE PRISONERS ARE STILL IN CUSTODY AFTER A LAPSE OF TEN YEARS
LJ018-0326 I PROPOSE TO END AT THIS POINT THE DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THE MORE PROMINENT CRIMINAL CASES WHICH LODGED THEIR PERPETRATORS IN NEWGATE
LJ018-0327 THE MOST RECENT AFFAIRS ARE STILL TOO FRESH IN THE PUBLIC MIND TO NEED MORE THAN A PASSING REFERENCE
LJ018-0328 FEW OF THE NEWGATE NOTORIETIES OF LATE YEARS SHOW ANY MARKED PECULIARITIES
LJ018-0329 THEIR CRIMES FOLLOW IN THE LINES OF OTHERS ALREADY FOUND AND OFTEN MORE THAN ONCE IN THE CALENDARS
LJ018-0330 VIOLENT PASSIONS TOO EASILY AROUSED PROMPTED THE FRENCHWOMAN MARGUERITE DIXBLANC
LJ018-0331 TO MURDER HER MISTRESS MADAME RIEL IN PARK LANE AS COURVOISIER THE SWISS HAD BEEN TEMPTED TO MURDER LORD WILLIAM RUSSELL
LJ018-0332 GREED IN THE LATTER CASE WAS A SECONDARY MOTIVE
LJ018-0333 IT WAS THE PRINCIPAL INCENTIVE WITH KATE WEBSTER THAT FIERCE AND BRUTAL FEMALE SAVAGE WHO TOOK THE LIFE OF HER MISTRESS AT RICHMOND
LJ018-0334 WEBSTER IT MAY BE MENTIONED HERE WAS ONE OF THE WORST PRISONERS EVER REMEMBERED IN NEWGATE
LJ018-0335 MOST VIOLENT IN TEMPER AND ADDICTED TO THE MOST FRIGHTFUL LANGUAGE
LJ018-0336 WEBSTER'S DEVICES FOR DISPOSING OF THE BODY OF HER VICTIM WILL CALL TO MIND THOSE OF THEODORE GARDELLE
LJ018-0337 OF GOOD AND GREENACRE AND CATHERINE HAYES
LJ018-0338 GREED IN ANOTHER FORM LED THE STAUNTONS TO MAKE AWAY WITH MRS. PATRICK STAUNTON MURDERING HER WITH DEVILISH CRUELTY BY SLOW DEGREES
LJ018-0339 THE JUDGE SIR HENRY HAWKINS IN PASSING SENTENCE
LJ018-0340 CHARACTERIZED THIS AS A CRIME MORE BLACK AND HIDEOUS THAN ANY IN THE CRIMINAL ANNALS OF THE COUNTRY
LJ018-0341 BUT IT WAS SCARCELY WORSE THAN THAT OF MRS. BROWNRIGG OR THAT OF THE METEYARDS BOTH OF WHOM DID THEIR HELPLESS APPRENTICES TO DEATH
LJ018-0342 IT WAS TO EFFECT THE RUPTURE OF AN IRKSOME TIE THAT LED HENRY WAINWRIGHT TO MURDER HARRIET LANE DELIBERATELY AND IN COLD BLOOD
LJ018-0343 IN THIS CASE THE TIE WAS UNSANCTIFIED BUT IT WAS NOT MORE INCONVENIENT THAN THAT WHICH URGED GREENACRE TO A SIMILAR CRIME
LJ018-0344 IN COLDBLOODED PREMEDITATION IT RIVALED THAT OF THE MANNINGS
LJ018-0345 AS IN THAT CASE THE GRAVE HAD BEEN DUG LONG IN ANTICIPATION AND THE CHLORIDE OF LIME PURCHASED TO DESTROY THE CORPSE
LJ018-0346 HENRY WAINWRIGHT'S ATTEMPT TO GET RID OF THE BODY WAS INGENIOUS BUT NOT ORIGINAL
LJ018-0347 AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH LED TO DETECTION WERE SCARCELY NOVEL PROOFS OF THE OLD ADAGE THAT MURDER WILL OUT
LJ018-0348 HENRY WAINWRIGHT'S IMPASSIONED DENIAL OF HIS CRIME EVEN AFTER IT HAD BEEN BROUGHT FULLY HOME TO HIM HAS MANY PARALLELS IN THE CRIMINAL RECORDS
LJ018-0349 HIS DISCLAIMER DISTINCT AND DETAILED ON EVERY POINT WAS INTENDED SIMPLY FOR EFFECT
LJ018-0350 HE MIGHT SWEAR HE WAS NOT THE MURDERER THAT HE NEVER FIRED A PISTOL IN HIS LIFE
LJ018-0351 AND THAT IN SPITE OF THE VERDICT OF THE JURY HE LEFT THE DOCK WITH A CALM AND QUIET CONSCIENCE
LJ018-0352 BUT THERE WAS NO DOUBT OF HIS GUILT AS THE LORD CHIEF JUSTICE TOLD HIM WHILE EXPRESSING GREAT REGRET AT HIS RASH ASSERTION
LJ018-0353 WAINWRIGHT'S DEMEANOR AFTER SENTENCE HAS BEEN DESCRIBED IN THE LAST CHAPTER
LJ018-0354 DOUBTS WERE LONG ENTERTAINED WHETHER THOMAS WAINWRIGHT
LJ018-0355 WHO WAS CONVICTED AS AN ACCESSORY AFTER THE FACT HAD NOT REALLY TAKEN AN ACTIVE PART IN THE MURDER
LJ018-0356 BUT A CONVERSATION OVERHEARD BETWEEN THE TWO BROTHERS IN NEWGATE SATISFACTORILY EXONERATED THOMAS WAINWRIGHT
LJ018-0357 POISONING HAS STILL ITS VICTIMS
LJ018-0358 CHRISTINA EDMUNDS HAD RESORT TO STRYCHNIA THE SAME LETHAL DRUG THAT PALMER USED
LJ018-0359 HER OBJECT BEING FIRST TO DISPOSE OF THE WIFE OF A MAN FOR WHOM SHE HAD CONCEIVED A GUILTY PASSION
LJ018-0360 THEN TO DIVERT SUSPICION FROM HERSELF BY THROWING IT ON A CONFECTIONER WHOSE SWEETMEATS SHE BOUGHT
LJ018-0361 TAMPERED WITH AND RETURNED TO THE SHOP
LJ018-0362 THE TRIAL OF MISS EDMUNDS WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT UNDER LORD CAMPBELL'S ACT ALREADY REFERRED TO
LJ018-0363 SHE WAS FOUND GUILTY
LJ018-0364 IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT SHE MADE A STATEMENT WHICH LED TO THE EMPANELING OF A JURY OF MATRONS WHO DECIDED THAT THERE WAS NO CAUSE FOR AN ARREST OF JUDGMENT
LJ018-0365 KATE WEBSTER FOLLOWED THE SAME COURSE BUT THESE PLEAS OF PREGNANCY ARE NOT COMMON NOWADAYS
LJ018-0366 ALTHOUGH SENTENCE OF DEATH WAS PASSED ON EDMUNDS IT WAS COMMUTED TO PENAL SERVITUDE FOR LIFE
LJ018-0367 BUT SHE EVENTUALLY PASSED INTO BROADMOOR LUNATIC ASYLUM WHERE SHE BUSIES HERSELF WITH WATERCOLOR DRAWING
LJ018-0368 THE STILL MORE RECENT CASES OF POISONING WHICH HAVE OCCURRED WERE NOT CONNECTED WITH NEWGATE
LJ018-0369 THE MYSTERIOUS BRAVO CASE THAT OF DR. LAMSON AND THAT OF KATE DOVER
LJ018-0370 UNHAPPILY SHOW THAT SOCIETY IS MORE THAN EVER AT THE MERCY OF THE INSIDIOUS AND UNSCRUPULOUS ADMINISTRATION OF POISONOUS DRUGS
LJ018-0371 A CASE REPRODUCING MANY OF THE FEATURES OF THE 'FLOWERY LAND' OCCURRED TWELVE YEARS LATER WHEN THE CREW OF THE 'LENNIE'
LJ018-0372 MUTINIED MURDERED THE CAPTAIN AND MATES SPARING THE STEWARD ONLY ON CONDITION THAT HE WOULD NAVIGATE THE SHIP TO THE MEDITERRANEAN
LJ018-0373 THE MUTINEERS WERE OF THE SAME STAMP AS THE CREW OF THE 'FLOWERY LAND'
LJ018-0374 FOREIGNERS VINDICTIVE RECKLESS AND TRUCULENT RUFFIANS EASILY MOVED TO MURDEROUS RAGE
LJ018-0375 THE 'LENNIE'S' MEN WERE ALL GREEKS EXCEPT ONE KNOWN AS FRENCH PETER
LJ018-0376 WHO WAS THE RINGLEADER AND WHO HAD LONG BEEN AN HABITUAL CRIMINAL A REPUTED MURDERER AND CERTAINLY AN INMATE MORE THAN ONCE OF A FRENCH BAGNE
LJ018-0377 CONVICTION WAS OBTAINED THROUGH THE EVIDENCE OF THE STEWARD AND TWO OF THE LEAST CULPABLE OF THE CREW
LJ018-0378 IN NEWGATE THE 'LENNIE' MUTINEERS WERE EXTREMELY WELL BEHAVED
LJ018-0379 RESOLUTE DETERMINEDLOOKING MEN THEIR COURAGE BROKE DOWN IN CONFINEMENT
LJ018-0380 THEY PAID CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE COUNSELS OF THE ARCHIMANDRITE AND DIED QUITE PENITENT. A STORY IS TOLD OF ONE OF THEM BIG HARRY
LJ018-0381 THE WILDEST AND MOST CUTTHROAT LOOKING OF THE LOT WHICH PROVES THAT HE COULD BE GRATEFUL FOR KINDNESS AND WAS NOT ALL BAD
LJ018-0382 HE HAD STEADFASTLY REFUSED TO EAT MEAT ON SOME RELIGIONS SCRUPLES AND FOR THE SAME REASON WOULD NOT TOUCH SOUP
LJ018-0383 HE WAS GLAD THEREFORE TO GET AN EXTRA ALLOWANCE OF BREAD
LJ018-0384 AND TO SHOW HIS GRATITUDE TO THE WARDER WHO PROCURED THIS PRIVILEGE FOR HIM HE MADE HIM A PRESENT
LJ018-0385 IT WAS HIS OWN HANDIWORK A BIRD PECKING AT A FLOWER
LJ018-0386 THE WHOLE MANUFACTURED WHILE IN THE CONDEMNED CELL OF THE CRUMB OF BREAD MADE INTO PASTE
LJ018-0387 THE FLOWER HAD BERRIES ALSO OF BREAD FIXED ON STEMS MADE FROM THE FIBER DRAWN FROM THE STUFFING OF HIS MATTRESS
LJ018-0388 AND THE BIRD'S LEGS WERE A COUPLE OF TEETH BROKEN OFF THE PRISONER'S COMB
LJ018-0389 OF THE LESSER CRIMINALS FORGERS THIEVES SWINDLERS NEWGATE CONTINUED TO RECEIVE ITS FULL SHARE UP TO THE LAST
LJ018-0390 BUT THERE WERE FEW CASES SO REMARKABLE AS THE GREAT ONES ALREADY RECORDED
LJ018-0391 MR. BAMELL OAKLEY MADE A RICH HARVEST FOR A TIME AND WAS SAID AT THE TIME OF HIS TRIAL
LJ018-0392 TO HAVE OBTAINED AS MUCH AS FOUTY THOUSAND POUNDS BY FALSE AND FRAUDULENT PRETENSES
LJ018-0393 MESSRS. SWINDLEHURST SAFFERY AND LANGLEY CLEARED A LARGE PROFIT
LJ018-0394 BY SWINDLING THE ARTISANS' DWELLINGS COMPANY AND MADAME RACHEL PASSED THROUGH NEWGATE ON HER WAY TO MILLBANK
LJ018-0395 CONVICTED OF OBTAINING JEWELERY UNDER THE FALSE PRETENSE OF MAKING SILLY WOMEN BEAUTIFUL FOR EVER
LJ018-0396 THE GREATEST CAUSES CÉLÈBRE HOWEVER OF RECENT TIMES WERE THE TURF FRAUDS BY WHICH THE COMTESSE DE GONCOURT WAS SWINDLED
LJ018-0397 OUT OF LARGE SUMS IN SHAM SPORTING SPECULATIONS. THE CONVICTION OF THE PRINCIPALS IN THIS NEFARIOUS TRANSACTION
LJ018-0398 BENSON THE TWO KURRS BALE AND MURRAY LED TO STRANGE REVELATIONS OF DISHONEST PRACTICES AMONGST THE DETECTIVE POLICE
LJ019-0001 THE CHRONICLES OF NEWGATE VOLUME TWO BY ARTHUR GRIFFITHS SECTION TWENTY TWO NEWGATE REFORMED
LJ019-0002 THE TIME AT LENGTH APPROACHED WHEN A RADICAL AND COMPLETE CHANGE WAS TO COME OVER THE OLD CITY JAIL
LJ019-0003 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR NEWGATE TO ESCAPE FOR EVER THE INFLUENCES PRESSING SO STRONGLY TOWARDS PRISON REFORM
LJ019-0004 ELSEWHERE THE SPIRIT HAD BEEN MORE OR LESS ACTIVE ALTHOUGH NOT UNIFORMLY OR ALWAYS TO THE SAME EXTENT
LJ019-0005 THERE HAD BEEN A PAUSE IN LEGISLATION EXCEPT OF A PERMISSIVE KIND. THE 2ND AND 3RD VICTORIA CAP. 56
LJ019-0006 LAID IT DOWN THAT INDIVIDUALS MIGHT BE CONFINED SEPARATELY AND APART IN SINGLE CELLS
LJ019-0007 BY OTHER ACTS LOCAL AUTHORITIES WERE EMPOWERED TO CONSTRUCT NEW JAILS OR HIRE ACCOMMODATION IN THE DISTRICT
LJ019-0008 BUT NO STEPS HAD BEEN TAKEN IN PARLIAMENT TO ENFORCE A BETTER SYSTEM OF DISCIPLINE
LJ019-0009 OR TO INSIST UPON THE CONSTRUCTION OF PRISONS ON THE MOST APPROVED PLAN
LJ019-0010 AS REGARDS THE FIRST HOWEVER SIR JAMES GRAHAM WHEN HOME SECRETARY IN EIGHTEEN FORTY THREE
LJ019-0011 HAD APPOINTED A COMMITTEE OF PRISON INSPECTORS PRESIDED OVER BY THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE TO DRAW UP RULES AND DIETARIES
LJ019-0012 WHICH WERE THEN RECOMMENDED TO AND GENERALLY ADOPTED BY THE VISITING JUSTICES ALL OVER THE KINGDOM
LJ019-0013 AS REGARDS THE SECOND THE GOVERNMENT HAD SET A GOOD EXAMPLE AND IN DECIDING UPON THE ERECTION OF PENTONVILLE PRISON
LJ019-0014 HAD EMBARKED ON A CONSIDERABLE EXPENDITURE IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A MODEL PRISON FOR GENERAL IMITATION
LJ019-0015 THE FIRST STONE OF PENTONVILLE PRISON WAS LAID ON THE 10TH APRIL 1840 BY THE MARQUIS OF NORMANBY
LJ019-0016 THEN HOME SECRETARY AND THE PRISON WHICH CONTAINED FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY CELLS WAS OCCUPIED ON THE 21ST DECEMBER EIGHTEEN FORTY TWO
LJ019-0017 THIS BUILDING WAS A COSTLY AFFAIR. THE SITE WAS UNEVEN AND HAD TO BE LEVELED
LJ019-0018 MOREOVER THE GROSS EXPENDITURE WAS INCREASED PARTLY FROM ITS BEING CONSIDERED NECESSARY AS IT WAS A NATIONAL PRISON
LJ019-0019 TO MAKE A GREAT ARCHWAY AND TO MAKE THE CHARACTER OF IT MORE IMPOSING THAN IF IT HAD BEEN SITUATED IN THE COUNTRY AND HAD BEEN AN ORDINARY PRISON
LJ019-0020 UP TO THE 21ST DECEMBER EIGHTEEN FORTY TWO
LJ019-0021 WITH THE ADDITIONS MADE TO THAT DATE THE TOTAL EXPENDITURE AMOUNTED TO NEARLY £90000 OR ABOUT £180 PER CELL
LJ019-0022 ON THE OTHER HAND IT MUST BE ADMITTED
LJ019-0023 THAT THIS WAS AN EXPERIMENTAL CONSTRUCTION AND THAT TOO STRICT A LIMITATION OF OUTLAY WOULD HAVE MILITATED SERIOUSLY AGAINST THE USEFULNESS OF THE BUILDING
LJ019-0024 NOR MUST IT BE OVERLOOKED THAT THIS THE FIRST MODEL PRISON ALTHOUGH OBTAINED AT A CONSIDERABLE COST BECAME ACTUALLY WHAT ITS NAME IMPLIED
LJ019-0025 PENTONVILLE HAS REALLY BEEN THE MODEL ON WHICH ALL SUBSEQUENT PRISON CONSTRUCTION HAS BEEN BASED. ALL PRISONS AT HOME AND ABROAD ARE BUT VARIATIONS
LJ019-0026 OF COURSE WITH THE ADDED IMPROVEMENTS FOLLOWING LONGER EXPERIENCE OF THE PATTERN ORIGINATED BY THE ARCHITECTURAL GENIUS OF SIR JOSHUA JEBB
LJ019-0027 THE INTERNAL ARRANGEMENTS OF THE NEW MODEL WERE CAREFULLY SUPERVISED BY A BODY OF DISTINGUISHED MEN AMONG WHICH WERE MANY PEERS LORD JOHN RUSSELL
LJ019-0028 MR. SHAWLEFEVRE THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS SIR BENJAMIN BRODIE
LJ019-0029 MAJOR JEBB R.E. AND THE TWO PRISON INSPECTORS MESSRS. CRAWFORD AND RUSSELL WITH WHOSE NAMES THE READER IS ALREADY FAMILIAR
LJ019-0030 MAJOR AFTERWARDS SIR JOSHUA JEBB
LJ019-0031 WAS THE MOVING SPIRIT AMONG THESE COMMISSIONERS AND HE IS NOW GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS THE ORIGINATOR OF MODERN PRISON ARCHITECTURE
LJ019-0032 THE MOVEMENT THUS LAUDABLY INITIATED BY THE GOVERNMENT SOON SPREAD TO THE PROVINCES
LJ019-0033 SOME JURISDICTIONS GREATLY TO THEIR CREDIT STROVE AT ONCE TO FOLLOW THE LEAD OF THE CENTRAL AUTHORITY
LJ019-0034 WITHIN HALFADOZEN YEARS NO LESS THAN FIFTYFOUR NEW PRISONS WERE BUILT ON THE PENTONVILLE PLAN OTHERS WERE IN PROGRESS
LJ019-0035 AND THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SEPARATE CELLS PROVIDED AMOUNTED TO ELEVEN THOUSAND ODD
LJ019-0036 THIS LIST INCLUDED WAKEFIELD LEEDS KIRKDALE MANCHESTER BIRMINGHAM AND DUBLIN
LJ019-0037 LIVERPOOL WAS BUILDING A NEW PRISON WITH A THOUSAND CELLS THE COUNTY OF SURREY ONE WITH SEVEN HUNDRED
LJ019-0038 THE COST IN EACH VARIED CONSIDERABLY THE GENERAL AVERAGE BEING FROM £120 TO £130 PER CELL
LJ019-0039 AT PENTONVILLE THE RATE WAS HIGHER BUT THERE THE EXPENSE HAD BEEN INCREASED BY THE SITE
LJ019-0040 THE DIFFICULTY OF ACCESS AND THE ADMITTED NECESSITY OF GIVING ARCHITECTURAL IMPORTANCE TO THIS THE NATIONAL MODEL PRISON
LJ019-0041 OTHER JURISDICTIONS WERE LESS PROMPT TO RECOGNIZE THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES THE CITY OF LONDON AMONG THE NUMBER AS I SHALL PRESENTLY SHOW AT LENGTH
LJ019-0042 THESE WERE EITHER SATISFIED WITH A MAKESHIFT AND MODIFIED EXISTING BUILDINGS WITHOUT CLOSE REGARD TO THEIR SUITABILITY OR FOR A LONG TIME DID NOTHING AT ALL
LJ019-0043 AMONG THE LATTER WERE NOTABLY THE COUNTIES OF CHESHIRE LINCOLNSHIRE NORFOLK SUFFOLK NOTTINGHAMSHIRE THE EAST AND NORTH RIDINGS OF YORKSHIRE
LJ019-0044 THE SOUTH AND WEST OF ENGLAND WERE ALSO VERY LAGGARD AND MANY YEARS WERE STILL TO ELAPSE BEFORE THE PRISONS IN THESE PARTS WERE PROPERLY RECONSTITUTED
LJ019-0045 NOT LESS REMARKABLE THAN THIS DIVERSE INTERPRETATION OF A MANIFEST DUTY
LJ019-0046 WAS THE VARIETY OF VIEWS AS REGARDS THE DISCIPLINE TO BE INTRODUCED IN THESE NEW PRISONS THE TIME WAS ONE
LJ019-0047 WHEN THOUGHTFUL PEOPLE WHO CONCERNED THEMSELVES CLOSELY WITH SOCIAL QUESTIONS WERE GREATLY EXERCISED AS TO THE BEST SYSTEM OF TREATING THE INMATES OF A JAIL
LJ019-0048 A NEW AND STILL IMPERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD SCIENCE HAD ARISEN
LJ019-0049 THE PRINCIPLES OF WHICH WERE DEBATED BY DISPUTANTS OF WIDELY OPPOSITE OPINIONS WITH AN EARNESTNESS THAT SOMETIMES BORDERED UPON ACRIMONY
LJ019-0050 ONE SCHOOL WERE STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF THE CONTINUOUS SEPARATION OF PRISONERS
LJ019-0051 THE OTHER SUPPORTED THE THEORY OF LABOR IN ASSOCIATION BUT UNDER A STRINGENT RULE OF SILENCE WITH ISOLATION ONLY AT NIGHT
LJ019-0052 BOTH SYSTEMS CAME TO US FROM THE UNITED STATES. THE DIFFERENCE WAS REALLY MORE IN DEGREE THAN IN PRINCIPLE
LJ019-0053 AND OUR MODERN PRACTICE HAS PRUDENTLY TRIED TO STEER BETWEEN THE TWO EXTREMES ACCEPTING AS THE BEST SYSTEM A JUDICIOUS COMBINATION OF BOTH
LJ019-0054 BUT ABOUT EIGHTEEN FIFTY THE TWO SIDES WERE DISTINCTLY HOSTILE AND THE CONTROVERSY RAN HIGH
LJ019-0055 HIGH AUTHORITIES WERE IN FAVOR OF CONTINUOUS SEPARATION
LJ019-0056 COLONEL JEBB PREFERRED IT MESSRS. CRAWFORD AND WHITWORTH RUSSELL WERE CONVINCED THAT THE COMPLETE ISOLATION OF CRIMINALS FROM ONE ANOTHER
LJ019-0057 WAS THE TRUE BASIS OF A SOUND SYSTEM OF PRISON DISCIPLINE
LJ019-0058 PRISON CHAPLAINS OF EXPERIENCE AND HIGH REPUTE SUCH AS MESSRS. FIELD CLAY KINGSMILL BURT AND OSBORNE ALSO ADVOCATED IT
LJ019-0059 IT WAS CLAIMED FOR IT THAT IT WAS MORE DETERRENT
LJ019-0060 THAT IN DISTRICTS WHERE IT WAS THE RULE EVILDOERS ESPECIALLY DREADED COMING UNDER ITS IRKSOME CONDITIONS
LJ019-0061 ANOTHER ARGUMENT WAS THAT IT AFFORDED MORE HOPE OF THE REFORMATION OF CRIMINALS
LJ019-0062 THE SYSTEM OF ASSOCIATED LABOR IN SILENCE HAD ALSO ITS WARM SUPPORTERS
LJ019-0063 WHO MAINTAINED THAT UNDER THIS SYSTEM PRISONERS WERE MORE INDUSTRIOUS AND MORE HEALTHY
LJ019-0064 THAT THEIR CONDITION WAS MORE NATURAL AND APPROXIMATED MORE NEARLY TO THAT OF DAILY LIFE
LJ019-0065 BETTER INDUSTRIAL RESULTS WERE OBTAINED FROM IT AND INSTRUCTION IN TRADES WAS EASIER AND PRISONERS WERE MORE LIKELY TO LEAVE JAIL
LJ019-0066 WITH THE MEANS OF EARNING AN HONEST LIVELIHOOD IF SO DISPOSED
LJ019-0067 THE OPPOSING CHAMPIONS WERE NOT SLOW TO FIND FAULTS AND FLAWS IN THE SYSTEM THEY CONDEMNED
LJ019-0068 SEPARATION WAS INJURIOUS TO HEALTH MENTAL OR PHYSICAL SAID ONE SIDE MEN BROKE DOWN WHEN SUBJECTED TO IT FOR MORE THAN A CERTAIN PERIOD
LJ019-0069 AND IT WAS UNSAFE TO FIX THIS LIMIT ABOVE TWELVE MONTHS ALTHOUGH SOME RASH ADVOCATES WERE IN FAVOR OF EIGHTEEN MONTHS SOME INDEED OF TWO YEARS
LJ019-0070 THE OTHER SIDE RETORTED THAT THE SYSTEM OF ASSOCIATED LABOR WAS MOST COSTLY SO MANY OFFICERS BEING REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN THE DISCIPLINE OF SILENCE
LJ019-0071 MOREOVER IT WAS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO PREVENT COMMUNICATION AND MUTUAL CONTAMINATION
LJ019-0072 IT IS SCARCELY NECESSARY TO FOLLOW THE CONTROVERSY FURTHER I HAVE ONLY INTRODUCED THE SUBJECT AS SHOWING HOW LITTLE AS YET THE STATE
LJ019-0073 WAS IMPRESSED WITH THE NECESSITY FOR AUTHORITATIVE INTERFERENCE
LJ019-0074 THE LEGISLATURE WAS CONTENT TO LET LOCAL JURISDICTIONS EXPERIMENTALIZE FOR THEMSELVES WITH THE STRANGE ANOMALOUS RESULT
LJ019-0075 THAT A THIEF OR OTHER CRIMINAL MIGHT BE QUITE DIFFERENTLY TREATED ACCORDING AS HE WAS INCARCERATED ON ONE SIDE OR ANOTHER OF A BORDER LINE
LJ019-0076 THIS VARIETY WAS OFTEN EXTENDED TO ALL BRANCHES OF PRISON ECONOMY
LJ019-0077 THERE WAS AN ABSOLUTE WANT OF UNIFORMITY IN DIETARIES IN SOME PRISONS IT WAS TOO LIBERAL IN OTHERS TOO LOW
LJ019-0078 THE AMOUNT OF EXERCISE VARIED FROM ONE OR TWO HOURS DAILY TO HALF THE WORKING DAY
LJ019-0079 THE CELLS INHABITED BY PRISONERS WERE OF VERY VARYING DIMENSIONS
LJ019-0080 SOME WERE NOT SUFFICIENTLY VENTILATED OTHERS WERE WARMED ARTIFICIALLY AND WERE UNWHOLESOMELY CLOSE
LJ019-0081 THE USE OF GAS OR SOME OTHER MEANS OF LIGHTING MIGHT BE ADOPTED BUT MORE OFTEN WAS DISPENSED WITH
LJ019-0082 IN A GREAT NUMBER OF PRISONS NO PROVISION WAS MADE FOR THE EDUCATION OF PRISONERS IN SOME OTHERS THERE WAS A SUFFICIENT STAFF OF SCHOOLMASTERS AND INSTRUCTORS
LJ019-0083 THE DISCIPLINE ALSO VARIED GREATLY FROM THE SEVERELY PENAL TO THE CULPABLY LAX
LJ019-0084 THE GREATEST PAINS MIGHT BE TAKEN TO SECURE ISOLATION
LJ019-0085 THE PRISONERS MIGHT BE SUPERVISED AND WATCHED AT EVERY STEP AND MADE LIABLE TO PUNISHMENT FOR A TRIFLING BREACH OF AN IRKSOME CODE OF REGULATIONS
LJ019-0086 OR THEY MIGHT HERD TOGETHER OR COMMUNICATE FREELY AS IN THE OLD WORST DAYS. THEY MIGHT SEE EACH OTHER WHEN THEY LIKED AND CONVERSE SOTTO VOCE
LJ019-0087 OR MAKE SIGNS OR THE CHANCES OF RECOGNIZING OR BEING RECOGNIZED WERE REDUCED TO A MINIMUM BY THE USE OF A MASK
LJ019-0088 THERE WAS NO GENERAL RULE OF EMPLOYMENT HARD LABOR WAS OFTEN NOT INSISTED UPON IN SEPARATE CONFINEMENT
LJ019-0089 SOMETIMES IT EMBRACED THE TREADWHEEL OR THE NEWLYINVENTED INSTRUMENTS KNOWN AS CRANKS WHICH GROUND AIR
LJ019-0090 THE ALTERNATIVE BETWEEN LABOR OR IDLENESS OR THE SELECTION OF THE FORM OF LABOR
LJ019-0091 WERE MERE MATTERS OF CHANCE AND DECIDED ACCORDING TO THE VIEWS OF THE LOCAL MAGISTRACY
LJ019-0092 THEY WERE APPROVED OF AND EMPLOYED AT SOME PRISONS AT OTHERS OBJECTED TO BECAUSE THEY WERE UNPRODUCTIVE
LJ019-0093 AND BECAUSE THE MACHINE WAS OFTEN SO IMPERFECT THAT THE AMOUNT OF EFFORT COULD NOT BE EXACTLY REGULATED
LJ019-0094 OPINIONS DIFFERED GREATLY WITH REGARD TO THE TREADWHEEL SOME AUTHORITIES ADVOCATED IT AS A VERY SEVERE AND IRKSOME PUNISHMENT
LJ019-0095 WHICH WAS YET UNDER FULL CONTROL AND MIGHT BE MADE TO WORK CORNMILLS OR PROVE OTHERWISE PRODUCTIVE
LJ019-0096 OTHER AUTHORITIES AS STRONGLY CONDEMNED IT AS BRUTALIZING UNEQUAL IN ITS OPERATION AND ALTOGETHER A DEPLORABLE INVENTION
LJ019-0097 THIS WANT OF UNIFORMITY IN PRISON DISCIPLINE BECAME ERE LONG AN ACKNOWLEDGED EVIL PRESSING FOR SOME REMEDY
LJ019-0098 AND THE QUESTION WAS ONCE MORE TAKEN UP IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IN EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE MR. CHARLES PEARSON M.P
LJ019-0099 MOVED FOR A COMMITTEE TO REPORT UPON THE BEST MEANS OF SECURING SOME UNIFORM SYSTEM WHICH SHOULD BE PUNITIVE REFORMATORY AND SELFSUPPORTING
LJ019-0100 BUT THE SESSION WAS FAR ADVANCED AND THE MATTER WAS RELEGATED TO THE FOLLOWING YEAR
LJ019-0101 IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIR GEORGE GREY BROUGHT FORWARD A NEW MOTION TO THE SAME EFFECT
LJ019-0102 WHICH WAS PROMPTLY CARRIED WITH THE ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTION TO THE COMMITTEE TO SUGGEST ANY IMPROVEMENTS
LJ019-0103 THE LATTER HAD REFERENCE MORE ESPECIALLY TO A PROPOSAL EMANATING FROM MR. CHARLES PEARSON HIMSELF
LJ019-0104 THAT GENTLEMAN HAD COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE ORDINARY AND HACKNEYED METHODS OF TREATMENT WERE PRACTICALLY INEFFICACIOUS
LJ019-0105 AND THAT A NEW SYSTEM OF PRISON DISCIPLINE SHOULD BE INTRODUCED
LJ019-0106 HIS PLAN WAS TO DEVOTE THE WHOLE LABOR OF PRISONERS SENTENCED TO ANY TERM BETWEEN THREE MONTHS AND FOUR YEARS TO AGRICULTURE
LJ019-0107 DISTRICT PRISONS WERE TO BE ESTABLISHED FOR THIS PURPOSE EACH OF WHICH WOULD BE IN THE HEART OF A FARM OF A THOUSAND ACRES
LJ019-0108 THE PRISONERS WERE TO CULTIVATE THE LAND AND RAISE SUFFICIENT PRODUCE FOR THEIR OWN SUPPORT
LJ019-0109 MR. PEARSON BACKED UP HIS RECOMMENDATIONS BY MANY SOUND ARGUMENTS
LJ019-0110 FIELD LABOR HE URGED AND WITH REASON WAS A VERY SUITABLE EMPLOYMENT
LJ019-0111 HEALTHFUL EASILY LEARNT AND WELL ADAPTED TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF UNSKILLED LABORERS
LJ019-0112 SUCH EXCELLENT RETURNS MIGHT BE COUNTED UPON THAT A MARGIN OF PROFIT WOULD BE LEFT AFTER THE COST OF THE PRISONS HAD BEEN DEFRAYED
LJ019-0113 THE SCHEME WAS NO DOUBT FASCINATING AND IN MANY RESPECTS FEASIBLE
LJ019-0114 BUT MR. PEARSON OVERLOOKED SOME POINTS IN WHICH A MORE PRACTICAL MIND WOULD HAVE FORESEEN DIFFICULTY AND PERHAPS FORECASTED FAILURE
LJ019-0115 IN HIS PROPOSAL HE DWELT MUCH UPON THE HUMANIZING EFFECTS OF HEALTHFUL OPENAIR TOIL
LJ019-0116 ANTICIPATING THE BEST RESULTS FROM A SYSTEM WHICH MADE EARNINGS AND INDEED RELEASE DEPENDENT UPON THE AMOUNT OF WORK DONE
LJ019-0117 THAT INDUSTRY MIGHT THUS BE STIMULATED AND ENCOURAGED WAS PROBABLE ENOUGH
LJ019-0118 AND LATER EXPERIENCE HAS FULLY PROVED THE ADVANTAGE OF A JUDICIOUS SYSTEM OF GRATUITIES FOR LABOR
LJ019-0119 BUT MR. PEARSON HARDLY CONSIDERED THE CONVERSE SUFFICIENTLY AND
LJ019-0120 OMITTED THE FACT THAT HE MIGHT HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT PERSISTENT IDLENESS WHICH IS NOT AN UNKNOWN CHARACTERISTIC OF THE CRIMINAL CLASS
LJ019-0121 THE HOPE OF REWARD MIGHT DO MUCH BUT NO SYSTEM OF PENAL DISCIPLINE IS COMPLETE UNLESS IT CAN ALSO COUNT UPON THE FEAR OF PUNISHMENT
LJ019-0122 MR. PEARSON SEEMS TO HAVE TAKEN FOR GRANTED THAT ALL PRISONERS WOULD BEHAVE WELL IN HIS DISTRICT PRISONS
LJ019-0123 ON THAT ACCOUNT HE MADE NO PROVISION TO INSURE SAFE CUSTODY
LJ019-0124 THINKING PERHAPS THAT PRISONERS SO WELL DISPOSED WOULD CHEERFULLY REMAIN IN JAIL OF THEIR OWN ACCORD
LJ019-0125 BUT AN OPEN FARM OF A THOUSAND ACRES WOULD HAVE OFFERED ABUNDANT CHANCES OF ESCAPE WHICH SOME AT LEAST WOULD HAVE ATTEMPTED PROBABLY WITH SUCCESS
LJ019-0126 THE CREATION OF AN EXPENSIVE STAFF FOR SUPERVISION
LJ019-0127 OR THE STILL MORE COSTLY PROCESS OF WALLING IN THE WHOLE FARM WOULD HAVE GREATLY ADDED TO THE CHARGES OF THESE ESTABLISHMENTS
LJ019-0128 I HAVE LINGERED TOO LONG PERHAPS OVER MR. PEARSON'S PROPOSAL BUT SOME REFERENCE WAS INDISPENSABLE TO A SCHEME
LJ019-0129 WHICH MARKED THE GROWTH OF PUBLIC INTEREST IN PRISON AFFAIRS AND WHICH WAS THE GERM OF THE NEW SYSTEM
LJ019-0130 SINCE ADMIRABLY DEVELOPED IN THE CONVICT PRISONS OF THIS COUNTRY
LJ019-0131 MR. PEARSON AND THE COMMITTEE OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY HAVE THE MORE CLAIM ON OUR CONSIDERATION BECAUSE
LJ019-0132 IN THE INQUIRY WHICH FOLLOWED ATTENTION WAS AGAIN ATTRACTED TO NEWGATE
LJ019-0133 THE CONDITION OF THAT PRISON IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY MAY BE GATHERED FROM THE PAGES OF THE REPORT. NOT MUCH HAD BEEN DONE TO REMEDY THE OLD DEFECTS
LJ019-0134 RADICAL IMPROVEMENT WAS GENERALLY CONSIDERED IMPOSSIBLE THE GREAT EVIL HOWEVER HAD BEEN SENSIBLY DIMINISHED
LJ019-0135 THERE WAS NO LONGER OR AT WORST BUT RARELY AND FOR SHORT PERIODS THE SAME OVERCROWDING
LJ019-0136 THIS WAS OBVIATED BY THE FREQUENT SESSIONS OF THE CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT AND THE UTILIZATION OF THE TWO SUBSIDIARY PRISONS IN GILTSPUR STREET AND SOUTHWARK
LJ019-0137 THE PRISON POPULATION OF NEWGATE WAS STILL SUBJECT TO GREAT FLUCTUATIONS BUT IT SELDOM ROSE ABOVE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY OR THREE HUNDRED
LJ019-0138 AT THE MOST CROWDED PERIODS OR JUST BEFORE THE SESSIONAL JAIL DELIVERY AND AT ITS LOWEST IT FELL SOMETIMES TO FIFTY OR SIXTY
LJ019-0139 THESE NUMBERS WOULD HAVE STILL FURTHER DECREASED AND THE JAIL WOULD HAVE BEEN ALMOST EMPTY BUT FOR THE MISDEMEANANTS WHO WERE STILL SENT TO NEWGATE
LJ019-0140 AT TIMES ON LONG TERMS OF IMPRISONMENT AND FOR THE TRANSPORTS WHOM THE HOME OFFICE WERE OFTEN AS OF OLD SLOW TO REMOVE
LJ019-0141 THE OLD WARDS DAY ROOMS AND SLEEPING ROOMS COMBINED OF WHICH THE READER HAS ALREADY HEARD SO MUCH
LJ019-0142 NOW SELDOM CONTAINED MORE THAN TEN OR A DOZEN EACH SOME SORT OF DECORUM WAS MAINTAINED AMONG THE OCCUPANTS IN THE DAYTIME
LJ019-0143 DRINKING AND GAMING
LJ019-0144 THE INDISCRIMINATE VISITATION OF FRIENDS AND THE ALMOST UNLIMITED ADMISSION OF EXTRA FOOD THESE MORE GLARING DEFECTS HAD DISAPPEARED
LJ019-0145 BUT REFORMATION WAS ONLY SKIN DEEP BELOW THE SURFACE MANY OF THE OLD EVILS STILL RANKLED
LJ019-0146 THERE WAS AS YET NO CONTROL OVER THE PRISONERS AFTER LOCKINGUP TIME
LJ019-0147 THIS OCCURRED IN SUMMER AT EIGHT BUT IN THE WINTER MONTHS IT TOOK PLACE AT DUSK AND WAS OFTEN AS EARLY AS FOUR OR FIVE
LJ019-0148 THE PRISONERS WERE STILL LEFT TO THEMSELVES TILL NEXT MORNING'S UNLOCKING
LJ019-0149 AND THEY SPENT SOME FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN HOURS IN TOTAL DARKNESS AND ALMOST WITHOUT CHECK OR CONTROL
LJ019-0150 CAPTAIN WILLIAMS WHO WAS THE INSPECTOR OF PRISONS FOR THE HOME DISTRICT IN SUCCESSION TO MESSRS. CRAWFORD AND RUSSELL
LJ019-0151 STATED IN EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS VISITING NEWGATE ONE NIGHT WHEN HE HEARD A GREAT DISTURBANCE IN ONE OF THE DAY AND SLEEPING ROOMS
LJ019-0152 AND ON ENTERING IT FOUND THE PRISONERS ENGAGED IN KICKING BUNDLES OF WOOD FROM ONE END OF THE WARD TO THE OTHER
LJ019-0153 SOME ATTEMPT AT SUPERVISION WAS EXERCISED BY THE NIGHT WATCHMAN STATIONED ON THE LEADS WHO MIGHT HEAR WHAT WENT ON INSIDE
LJ019-0154 IF ANY DISTURBANCE REACHED HIS EARS HE REPORTED THE CASE TO THE GOVERNOR WHO NEXT MORNING VISITED THE WARD IN FAULT AND ASKED FOR THE CULPRIT
LJ019-0155 THE ENFORCEMENT OF DISCIPLINE DEPENDED UPON THE WANT OF HONOR AMONG THIEVES
LJ019-0156 UNLESS THE GUILTY PRISONER WAS GIVEN UP THE WHOLE WARD WAS PUNISHED EITHER BY THE EXCLUSION OF VISITORS OR THE DEPRIVATION OF FIRE
LJ019-0157 SHARP TESTS WHICH GENERALLY BROKE DOWN THE FIDELITY OF THE INMATES OF THE WARD TO ONE ANOTHER
LJ019-0158 LATER ON A MORE EFFICACIOUS BUT STILL IMPERFECT METHOD OF SUPERVISION WAS INTRODUCED. IRON CAGES WHICH ARE STILL TO BE SEEN IN NEWGATE
LJ019-0159 WERE CONSTRUCTED ON THE LANDINGS ENSCONCED IN WHICH WARDERS SPENT THE NIGHT ON DUTY AND ALERT TO WATCH THE SLEEPERS BELOW
LJ019-0160 AND CHECK BY REMONSTRANCE OR THREAT OF PUNISHMENT ALL WHO BROKE THE PEACE OF THE PRISON
LJ019-0161 THESE DISCIPLINARY IMPROVEMENTS WERE HOWEVER ONLY SLOWLY AND GRADUALLY INTRODUCED
LJ019-0162 OTHER CHANGES AFFECTING THE CONDITION AND PROPER TREATMENT OF PRISONERS WERE NOT MADE UNTIL THE INSPECTOR HAD URGED AND RECOMMENDED THEM
LJ019-0163 THUS THE WARDS WHICH AS I HAVE SAID WERE LEFT IN COMPLETE DARKNESS WERE NOW TO BE LIGHTED WITH GAS AND AFTER THIS MOST SALUTARY ADDITION
LJ019-0164 THE PERSONAL SUPERINTENDENCE OF NIGHT OFFICERS AS ALREADY DESCRIBED BECAME POSSIBLE
LJ019-0165 THE RULE BECAME GENERAL AS REGARDS THE PRISON DRESS HITHERTO CLOTHING HAD BEEN ISSUED ONLY TO SUCH AS WERE DESTITUTE OR IN RAGS AND ALL CLASSES OF PRISONERS
LJ019-0166 THOSE FOR TRIAL AND THOSE SENTENCED FOR SHORT TERMS OR LONG
LJ019-0167 WORE NO DISTINGUISHING COSTUME ALTHOUGH ITS USE WAS ADMITTED NOT ONLY FOR CLEANLINESS BUT AS A BADGE OF CONDITION AND A SECURITY AGAINST ESCAPE
LJ019-0168 RENEWED RECOMMENDATIONS TO PROVIDE EMPLOYMENT RESULTED IN THE PROVISION OF A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF OAKUM FOR PICKING
LJ019-0169 AND ONE OR TWO MEN WERE ALLOWED TO MEND CLOTHES AND MAKE SHOES. THE RULES MADE BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE WERE HUNG UP IN CONSPICUOUS PARTS OF THE PRISON
LJ019-0170 MORE OFFICERS WERE APPOINTED AS THE TIME OF SO MANY OF THOSE ALREADY ON THE STAFF WAS MONOPOLIZED BY ATTENDANCE AT THE CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT
LJ019-0171 ANOTHER CUSTOM WHICH HAD LED TO DISORDER WAS ABOLISHED
LJ019-0172 PRISONERS WHO HAD BEEN ACQUITTED WERE NOT PERMITTED TO RETURN TO THE PRISON TO SHOW THEIR JOY AND RECEIVE THE CONGRATULATIONS OF THEIR UNFORTUNATE FELLOWS
LJ019-0173 THE CORPORATION SEEMS TO HAVE INTRODUCED THESE SALUTARY CHANGES WITHOUT HESITATION
LJ019-0174 IT WAS LESS PROMPT APPARENTLY IN DEALING WITH STRUCTURAL ALTERATIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS
LJ019-0175 WELLFOUNDED COMPLAINTS HAD BEEN MADE OF THE WANT OF HEATING APPLIANCES IN THE JAIL
LJ019-0176 THE WARDS HAD OPEN FIRES BUT THE SEPARATE CELLS WERE NOT WARMED AT ALL
LJ019-0177 A SCHEME FOR HEATING THE WHOLE PRISON WITH HOTWATER PIPES AFTER THE SYSTEM NOW GENERALLY ADOPTED ELSEWHERE WAS CONSIDERED
LJ019-0178 AND ABANDONED BECAUSE OF THE EXPENSE. AS TO THE ENTIRE RECONSTRUCTION OF NEWGATE NOTHING HAD BEEN DONE AS YET
LJ019-0179 THIS WITH A SCHEME FOR LIMITING THE JAIL TO UNTRIED PRISONERS HAD BEEN URGENTLY RECOMMENDED BY LORD JOHN RUSSELL IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY
LJ019-0180 HIS LETTER TO THE CORPORATION UNDER DATE 4TH JUNE
LJ019-0181 IS AN INTERESTING DOCUMENT AND SHOWS THAT EVEN AT THAT DATE THE GOVERNMENT CONTEMPLATED THE ERECTION OF A MODEL PRISON
LJ019-0182 LORD JOHN RUSSELL COMMENTING UPON THE OFFER OF THE CORPORATION TO IMPROVE NEWGATE
LJ019-0183 PROVIDED IT WAS HENCEFORTH USED ONLY FOR UNTRIED PRISONERS SUGGESTED THAT NEWGATE SHOULD BE ENTIRELY RECONSTRUCTED AND THE NEW BUILDING ADOPTED AS A MODEL
LJ019-0184 THE CORPORATION HAD AGREED TO SPEND £20000 ON ALTERATIONS BUT £60000 WOULD SUFFICE TO RECONSTRUCT
LJ019-0185 LORD JOHN WITH GREAT FAIRNESS ADMITTED THAT THE WHOLE OF THIS BURTHEN COULD NOT BE IMPOSED UPON THE CITY
LJ019-0186 SEEING THAT SINCE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT NEWGATE RECEIVED PRISONERS FOR TRIAL FROM SEVERAL COUNTIES
LJ019-0187 AND HE WAS THEREFORE PREPARED TO SUBMIT TO PARLIAMENT A PROPOSAL THAT HALF THE COST OF RECONSTRUCTION SHOULD BE BORNE BY PUBLIC FUNDS
LJ019-0188 HE FORWARDED PLANS PREPARED BY THE INSPECTORS OF PRISONS NOT FOR BLIND ADOPTION BUT AS A GUIDE
LJ019-0189 THIS PLAN WAS ON THE PRINCIPLE OF CELLULAR SEPARATION A SYSTEM ACCORDING TO LORD JOHN RUSSELL DESIRABLE IN ALL PRISONS
LJ019-0190 BUT IN A METROPOLITAN PRISON ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL THE CORPORATION IN REPLY DEMURRED RATHER TO ACCEPTING STRICT SEPARATION AS A RULE
LJ019-0191 FEELING THAT IT APPROACHED TOO NEARLY TO SOLITARY CONFINEMENT
LJ019-0192 THE COURT WAS HOWEVER PREPARED TO CONSIDER LORD JOHN RUSSELL'S PROPOSAL WITH REGARD TO THE COST OF REBUILDING
LJ019-0193 BUT AS THE PLAN WAS CONFESSEDLY EXPERIMENTAL FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COUNTRY GENERALLY THE AMOUNT FOR WHICH THE CITY SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE SHOULD BE DISTINCTLY LIMITED
LJ019-0194 NOT TO EXCEED A CERTAIN SUM TO BE AGREED UPON
LJ019-0195 A PROVISO WAS ALSO MADE THAT THE MAGISTRATES SHOULD CONTINUE TO EXERCISE FULL CONTROL OVER THE NEW JAIL
LJ019-0196 FREE FROM ANY OTHER INTERFERENCE THAN THAT OF THE INSPECTORS ON THE PART OF GOVERNMENT
LJ019-0197 NO DOUBT WISER COUNSELS PREVAILED WITH LORD JOHN RUSSELL
LJ019-0198 AND ON A MORE MATURE CONSIDERATION HE REALIZED THAT THE LIMITED AREA OF THE EXISTING NEWGATE SITE
LJ019-0199 AND THE COSTLINESS OF ENLARGING IT FORBADE ALL IDEA OF ENTIRELY RECONSTRUCTING THE JAIL SO AS TO CONSTITUTE IT A MODEL PRISON
LJ019-0200 IT WOULD BE FAR BETTER TO BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING
LJ019-0201 TO SELECT A SUFFICIENTLY SPACIOUS PIECE OF GROUND AND ERECT A PRISON WHICH FROM FOUNDATIONS TO ROOFS SHOULD BE IN CONFORMITY WITH THE NEWEST IDEAS
LJ019-0202 THE PREFERENCE GIVEN TO THE PENTONVILLE SYSTEM DESTROYED ALL HOPES OF A COMPLETE REFORMATION OF NEWGATE
LJ019-0203 BUT THE CONDITION OF THE GREAT CITY JAIL WAS EVIDENTLY CONSIDERED A REPROACH BY THE CITY AUTHORITIES AND A YEAR AFTER THE OPENING OF THE NEW MODEL AT PENTONVILLE
LJ019-0204 A SERIOUS EFFORT WAS MADE TO RECONSTRUCT NEWGATE
LJ019-0205 IN EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE THE JAIL COMMITTEE BROUGHT FORWARD A DEFINITE PROPOSAL TO PURCHASE GROUND IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY FOR THE ERECTION OF A NEW JAIL
LJ019-0206 THIS JAIL WAS NOMINALLY TO REPLACE THE GILTSPUR STREET COMPTER
LJ019-0207 THE SITE OF WHICH WAS TO BE SOLD TO CHRIST'S HOSPITAL BUT THE INTENTION WAS OF COURSE TO EMBODY AND ABSORB OLD NEWGATE IN THE NEW CONSTRUCTION
LJ019-0208 THE PROPOSAL MADE WAS TO PURCHASE SOME FIFTY THOUSAND SQUARE FEET BETWEEN NEWGATE WARWICK LANE AND THE SESSIONS HOUSE
LJ019-0209 THE SITUATION HAVING BEEN PROVED BY LONG EXPERIENCE TO BE SALUBRIOUS
LJ019-0210 BUT WHEN THIS SUGGESTION WAS BROUGHT BEFORE THE COURT OF ALDERMEN VARIOUS AMENDMENTS WERE PROPOSED
LJ019-0211 IT WAS URGED THAT THE AREA SELECTED FOR PURCHASE MUST BE EXCESSIVELY COSTLY TO ACQUIRE AND STILL QUITE INADEQUATE FOR THE CITY NEEDS
LJ019-0212 THE HOME SECRETARY HAD LAID IT DOWN THAT AT LEAST FIVE ACRES WOULD BE INDISPENSABLE AND SUCH AN AREA IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO OBTAIN WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE CITY
LJ019-0213 NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME THE TUFFNELL ESTATE IN HOLLOWAY WAS MENTIONED
LJ019-0214 THE CORPORATION OWNED LANDS THERE COVERING FROM NINETEEN TO TWENTY ACRES
LJ019-0215 WHY NOT MOVE THE CITY PRISON BODILY INTO THIS MORE RURAL SPOT WITH ITS PURER AIR AND GREATER BREATHING SPACE
LJ019-0216 EVENTUALLY HOLLOWAY WAS DECIDED UPON AS A SITE FOR THE NEW CITY PRISON
LJ019-0217 THE NECESSARY PRELIMINARIES TOOK SOME TIME BUT THE CONTRACTS FOR THE NEW BUILDING WERE COMPLETED IN EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE WHEN THE WORKS WERE COMMENCED
LJ019-0218 THE PRISON WAS TO CONTAIN FOUR HUNDRED AND FOUR PRISONERS AND THE ESTIMATED EXPENDITURE WAS £79000
LJ019-0219 IT WAS TO ACCOMMODATE ONLY THE CONVICTED PRISONERS SENTENCED TO TERMS SHORT OF PENAL SERVITUDE AND AFTER ITS COMPLETION
LJ019-0220 THE USES OF NEWGATE WERE NARROWED ALMOST ENTIRELY TO THOSE OF A PRISON OF DETENTION
LJ019-0221 IT WAS INTENDED AS FAR AS POSSIBLE THAT EXCEPT AWAITING TRIAL NO PRISONER SHOULD FIND HIMSELF RELEGATED TO NEWGATE
LJ019-0222 THIS PRINCIPLE BECAME MORE AND MORE GENERALLY THE RULE ALTHOUGH IT HAS NEVER BEEN PUNCTILIOUSLY OBSERVED. NOW AND AGAIN
LJ019-0223 MISDEMEANANTS HAVE FOUND THEIR WAY INTO NEWGATE AND WITHIN THE LAST FEW YEARS ONE OFFENDER AGAINST THE PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
LJ019-0224 WITH THE REDUCTION OF NUMBERS TO BE ACCOMMODATED THERE WAS AMPLE SPACE IN NEWGATE FOR ITS RECONSTRUCTION ON THE MOST APPROVED MODERN LINES
LJ019-0225 IN 1857
LJ019-0226 THE ERECTION OF A WING OR LARGE BLOCK OF CELLS WAS COMMENCED WITHIN THE ORIGINAL WALLS OF THE PRISON AND UPON THE NORTH OR MALE SIDE
LJ019-0227 THIS BLOCK CONTAINED ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY CELLS EMBRACING EVERY MODERN IMPROVEMENT
LJ019-0228 IT ALSO CONTAINED ELEVEN RECEPTION CELLS SIX PUNISHMENT CELLS AND A COUPLE OF CELLS FOR CONDEMNED CRIMINALS
LJ019-0229 THIS BLOCK WAS COMPLETED IN 1859 AFTER WHICH THE HITHERTO UNAVOIDABLE AND LONGCONTINUED PROMISCUOUS ASSOCIATION OF PRISONERS
LJ019-0230 IN 1861 A SIMILAR WORK WAS UNDERTAKEN TO PROVIDE SEPARATE CELLULAR ACCOMMODATION FOR THE FEMALE INMATES OF NEWGATE
LJ019-0231 AND BY THE FOLLOWING YEAR FORTYSEVEN NEW CELLS HAD BEEN BUILT ON THE MOST APPROVED PLAN
LJ019-0232 DURING THIS RECONSTRUCTION THE FEMALE PRISONERS WERE LODGED IN HOLLOWAY
LJ019-0233 AND WHEN IT WAS COMPLETED BOTH SIDES OF THE PRISON WERE BROUGHT INTO HARMONY WITH MODERN IDEAS
LJ019-0234 THE OLD BUILDINGS WERE ENTIRELY DISUSED AND THE WHOLE OF THE INMATES OF NEWGATE WERE KEPT CONSTANTLY IN SEPARATE CONFINEMENT
LJ019-0235 WITH THE LAST REEDIFICATION OF NEWGATE A WORK EXECUTED SOME SEVEN CENTURIES AFTER THE FIRST STONE OF THE OLD JAIL WAS LAID
LJ019-0236 THE ARCHITECTURAL RECORDS OF THE PRISON END. NOTHING MUCH WAS DONE AT NEWGATE IN THE WAY OF BUILDING OUTSIDE OR IN AFTER EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO
LJ019-0237 THE ACT FOR PRIVATE EXECUTIONS LED TO THE ERECTION OF THE GALLOWS SHED IN THE EXERCISING YARD AND AT THE FLANK OF THE PASSAGE FROM THE CONDEMNED CELLS
LJ019-0238 THE FIRST GLASS HOUSE OR ROOM IN WHICH PRISONERS COULD TALK IN PRIVATE WITH THEIR ATTORNEYS BUT YET BE SEEN BY THE WARDER ON THE WATCH HAD BEEN CONSTRUCTED
LJ019-0239 AND OTHERS WERE SUBSEQUENTLY ADDED
LJ019-0240 BUT NO STRUCTURAL ALTERATIONS WERE MADE FROM THE DATE FIRST QUOTED UNTIL THE TIME OF CLOSING THE PRISON IN 1881
LJ019-0241 BUT IN THE INTERVAL VERY COMPREHENSIVE AND I THINK IT MUST BE ADMITTED SALUTARY CHANGES WERE SUCCESSIVELY INTRODUCED INTO THE MANAGEMENT OF PRISONS
LJ019-0242 NEWGATE NATURALLY SHARED IN ANY ADVANTAGES DUE TO THESE REFORMS. I PROPOSE THEREFORE TO REFER TO THEM IN THE CONCLUDING PAGES OF THIS WORK
LJ019-0243 AND THUS BRING THE HISTORY OF PRISON DISCIPLINE DOWN TO OUR OWN TIMES
LJ019-0244 THE LAST INQUIRY INTO THE CONDITION AND MANAGEMENT OF OUR JAILS AND HOUSES OF CORRECTION WAS THAT MADE BY THE LORDS' COMMITTEE IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ019-0245 THE INQUIRY WAS MOST SEARCHING AND COMPLETE AND THE COMMITTEE SPOKE PLAINLY IN ITS REPORT
LJ019-0246 IT ANIMADVERTED STRONGLY ON THE MANY AND WIDE DIFFERENCES AS REGARDS CONSTRUCTION LABOR DIET AND GENERAL DISCIPLINE
LJ019-0247 WHICH EXISTED IN THE VARIOUS PRISONS
LJ019-0248 LEADING TO AN INEQUALITY UNCERTAINTY AND INEFFICIENCY OF PUNISHMENT PRODUCTIVE OF THE MOST PREJUDICIAL RESULTS
LJ019-0249 THE VARIETIES IN CONSTRUCTION WERE STILL VERY MARKED
LJ019-0250 IN MANY PRISONS THE PRISONERS WERE STILL ASSOCIATED AND FROM THE WANT OF A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF CELLS THE PRINCIPLE OF SEPARATION WAS STILL GREATLY NEGLECTED
LJ019-0251 YET THIS PRINCIPLE AS THE COMMITTEE POINTED OUT MUST NOW BE ACCEPTED AS THE FOUNDATION OF PRISON DISCIPLINE
LJ019-0252 WHILE ITS RIGID MAINTENANCE WAS IN ITS OPINION VITAL TO THE EFFICIENCY OF THE JAILS
LJ019-0253 EVEN WHERE CELLS HAD BEEN BUILT
LJ019-0254 THEY WERE FREQUENTLY BELOW THE STANDARD SIZE AND WERE THEREFORE NOT CERTIFIED FOR OCCUPATION AS WAS REQUIRED BY LAW
LJ019-0255 GREAT NUMBERS WERE NOT LIGHTED AT NIGHT AND WERE WITHOUT MEANS BY WHICH THEIR INMATES COULD COMMUNICATE IN CASE OF URGENT NECESSITY WITH THEIR KEEPERS
LJ019-0256 STILL GREATER WERE THE DIFFERENCES WITH REGARD TO EMPLOYMENT. THE VARIOUS AUTHORITIES HELD WIDELY DIFFERENT OPINIONS AS TO WHAT CONSTITUTED HARD LABOR
LJ019-0257 HERE THE TREADWHEEL WAS IN USE THERE CELLULAR CRANKS OR HARDLABOR MACHINES
LJ019-0258 BOTH HOWEVER VARIED GREATLY IN MECHANISM AND IN THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY THEY CALLED FORTH
LJ019-0259 WHILE THE FORMER WAS INTENDED FOR THE CONGREGATE LABOR OF A NUMBER AND THE LATTER AS ITS NAME IMPLIES IMPOSED CONTINUOUS SOLITARY TOIL
LJ019-0260 AT OTHER PRISONS SHOTDRILL THE LIFTING AND CARRYING OF HEAVY ROUND SHOT WAS THE FAVORITE METHOD OF INFLICTING PENAL LABOR
LJ019-0261 WITH THESE DIFFERENCES WERE OTHERS AS OPPOSED CONCERNING INDUSTRIAL OCCUPATION
LJ019-0262 THE JAIL AUTHORITIES OFTEN GAVE THE HIGHEST POSSIBLY UNDUE IMPORTANCE TO THE VALUE OF REMUNERATIVE EMPLOYMENT
LJ019-0263 AND SOUGHT TO MAKE PROFITABLE RETURNS FROM PRISONERS' LABOR THE TEST OF PRISON EFFICIENCY IN THIS VIEW THE COMMITTEE COULD NOT COINCIDE
LJ019-0264 AND IT WAS DECIDEDLY OF OPINION THAT IN ALL SHORT SENTENCES THE HARD LABOR OF THE TREADWHEEL CRANK AND SO FORTH SHOULD BE THE INVARIABLE RULE
LJ019-0265 IN DIETARIES AGAIN THE SAME WIDE DIVERSITY OF PRACTICE OBTAINED
LJ019-0266 THE EFFORTS MADE BY SIR JAMES GRAHAM YEARS BEFORE TO INTRODUCE UNIFORMITY IN THIS PARTICULAR HAD FAILED OF EFFECT
LJ019-0267 THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S SUGGESTED SCALE OF DIET HAD SELDOM BEEN CLOSELY FOLLOWED
LJ019-0268 IN SOME PLACES THE DIETARY WAS TOO FULL IN OTHERS TOO MEAGER ITS CONSTITUENTS WERE NOT OF THE MOST SUITABLE CHARACTER
LJ019-0269 MORE ANIMAL FOOD WAS GIVEN THAN WAS NECESSARY
LJ019-0270 VEGETABLES ESPECIALLY THE POTATO THAT MOST VALUABLE ANTISCORBUTIC WAS TOO OFTEN OMITTED
LJ019-0271 IN A WORD THE VALUE OF DIET AS A PART OF PENAL DISCIPLINE WAS STILL INSUFFICIENTLY RECOGNIZED
LJ019-0272 THE PRISONS WERE STILL FAR FROM INFLICTING THE THREE PUNISHMENTS HARD LABOR HARD FARE AND A HARD BED
LJ019-0273 WHICH SIR JOSHUA JEBB TOLD THE COMMITTEE HE CONSIDERED THE PROPER ELEMENTS OF PENAL DISCIPLINE
LJ019-0274 IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE HERE
LJ019-0275 THAT THE COMMITTEE OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE FULLY ENDORSED SIR JOSHUA'S RECOMMENDATIONS AS REGARDS A HARD BED AND RECOMMENDED THAT
LJ019-0276 DURING SHORT SENTENCES OR THE EARLIER STAGES OF A LONG CONFINEMENT
LJ019-0277 THE PRISONERS SHOULD BE MADE TO DISPENSE WITH THE USE OF A MATTRESS AND SHOULD SLEEP ON PLANKS
LJ019-0278 THIS SUGGESTION WAS ADOPTED IN THE ACT OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE WHICH FOLLOWED THE COMMITTEE'S REPORT AND OF WHICH MORE DIRECTLY
LJ019-0279 CLAUSE 92 SCHEDULE 1 OF THAT ACT AUTHORIZED THE USE OF PLANK BEDS WHICH WERE ADOPTED IN MANY PRISONS
LJ019-0280 THEY ARE NOW THE UNIVERSAL RULE
LJ019-0281 INTRODUCED AS WAS ERRONEOUSLY SUPPOSED BY THE PRISON COMMISSIONERS APPOINTED UNDER THE PRISON ACT OF 1877
LJ019-0282 THEIR ORIGIN IT WILL BE SEEN DATES BACK MUCH FURTHER THAN THAT
LJ019-0283 BEDS MIGHT WELL BE MADE HARD AND THEIR USE STRICTLY LIMITED
LJ019-0284 ACCORDING TO THIS COMMITTEE OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE BEDS IN THE SMALLER AND MOST CARELESSLY CONDUCTED PRISONS FORMED A LARGE ELEMENT IN THE LIFE OF A PRISONER
LJ019-0285 IN ONE JAIL FIFTEEN HOURS WERE SPENT IN BED OUT OF THE TWENTYFOUR. THIS WAS IN KEEPING WITH OTHER GRAVE DEFECTS AND OMISSIONS
LJ019-0286 THE MINOR BOROUGH PRISONS WERE THE WORST BLOT ON THE STILL DARK AND IMPERFECT SYSTEM
LJ019-0287 THEY WERE VERY NUMEROUS VERY IMPERFECT IN CONSTRUCTION AND MANAGEMENT AND THEY WERE VERY LITTLE REQUIRED
LJ019-0288 IN THEM ACCORDING TO THE COMMITTEE THE OLD OBJECTIONABLE PRACTICES WERE STILL IN FULL FORCE
LJ019-0289 THERE WAS UNRESTRAINED ASSOCIATION OF UNTRIED AND CONVICTED JUVENILE WITH ADULT PRISONERS VAGRANTS MISDEMEANANTS FELONS
LJ019-0290 THERE WERE DORMITORIES WITHOUT LIGHT CONTROL OR REGULATION AT NIGHT
LJ019-0291 WHICH WARDERS DREADING ASSAULT WERE AFRAID TO ENTER AFTER DARK EVEN TO CHECK RIOTING AND DISTURBANCE
LJ019-0292 PRISONERS STILL SLEPT TWO IN A BED
LJ019-0293 IN ONE PRISON THE BEDSTEADS HAD BEEN REMOVED LEST THE PRISONERS SHOULD BREAK THEM UP AND CONVERT THEM INTO WEAPONS OF OFFENSE
LJ019-0294 THE PRISON BUILDINGS WERE IN MANY PLACES OUT OF REPAIR OTHER HOUSES OFTEN OVERLOOKED THEM
LJ019-0295 A SINGLE OFFICER WAS THE ONLY CUSTODIAN AND DISCIPLINARY AUTHORITY IN THE JAIL
LJ019-0296 COMPLETE IDLENESS WAS TOLERATED THERE WAS NEITHER PENAL LABOR NOR LIGHT EMPLOYMENT
LJ019-0297 THE PRISONERS INTERCOMMUNICATED FREELY AND EXERCISED THE MOST INJURIOUS CORRUPTING INFLUENCES UPON ONE ANOTHER
LJ019-0298 THE TOTAL WANT OF ADMINISTRATION WAS VERY MARKED
LJ019-0299 BUT IN ONE PRISON IT WAS SUCH THAT THE PRISONERS' FOOD WAS SUPPLIED DAILY FROM THE NEIGHBORING INN AND THE INNKEEPER'S BILL CONSTITUTED THE ONLY ACCOUNTS KEPT
LJ019-0300 THE COMMITTEE MIGHT WELL SUGGEST THE ABOLITION OF THESE JAILS OR THEIR AMALGAMATION WITH THE LARGER COUNTY ESTABLISHMENTS IN THEIR IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORHOOD
LJ019-0301 SOME IDEA OF THE COMPARATIVE USELESSNESS OF THESE SMALL BOROUGH PRISONS WAS CONVEYED BY SOME FIGURES QUOTED BY THE COMMITTEE
LJ019-0302 IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO THERE WERE IN ALL ONE HUNDRED AND NINETYTHREE JAILS IN ENGLAND AND WALES
LJ019-0303 OF THESE SIXTYTHREE GAVE ADMITTANCE DURING THE ENTIRE YEAR TO LESS THAN TWENTYFIVE PRISONERS
LJ019-0304 TWENTYTWO OTHERS RECEIVED BETWEEN ELEVEN AND TWENTYFIVE
LJ019-0305 FOURTEEN RECEIVED LESS THAN ELEVEN AND MORE THAN SIX
LJ019-0306 WHILE TWENTYSEVEN RECEIVED LESS THAN SIX PRISONERS AND WERE IN SOME INSTANCES ABSOLUTELY TENANTLESS
LJ019-0307 THE RESULT OF THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE COMMITTEE OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO WAS THE PRISON ACT OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE
LJ019-0308 THE PENULTIMATE OF SUCH ENACTMENTS MANY OF THE PROVISIONS OF WHICH STILL REMAIN IN FORCE
LJ019-0309 THE MAIN OBJECT OF THIS ACT WAS TO COMPASS THAT UNIFORMITY IN DISCIPLINE AND TREATMENT GENERALLY
LJ019-0310 WHICH HAD LONG BEEN ADMITTED AS INDISPENSABLE AND HAD NEVER AS YET BEEN PROPERLY OBTAINED
LJ019-0311 THE LEGISLATURE WAS BEGINNING TO OVERCOME ITS DISINCLINATION TO INTERFERE ACTIVELY OR AUTHORITATIVELY
LJ019-0312 WITH THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ALTHOUGH STILL VERY LENIENTLY DISPOSED
LJ019-0313 HOWEVER IT NOW LAID DOWN IN PLAIN LANGUAGE AND WITH PRECISE DETAILS THE REQUIREMENTS OF A GOOD JAIL SYSTEM
LJ019-0314 THE SEPARATION OF PRISONERS IN CELLS DULY CERTIFIED BY THE INSPECTORS WAS INSISTED UPON
LJ019-0315 ALSO THEIR CONSTANT EMPLOYMENT IN LABOR APPROPRIATE TO THEIR CONDITION
LJ019-0316 HARD LABOR OF THE FIRST AND SECOND CLASS WAS CAREFULLY DEFINED
LJ019-0317 THE FORMER WHICH CONSISTED PRINCIPALLY OF THE TREADWHEEL CRANKS CAPSTANS SHOTDRILL
LJ019-0318 WAS TO BE THE RULE FOR ALL CONVICTED PRISONERS THROUGHOUT THE EARLY STAGES OF THEIR DETENTION
LJ019-0319 WHILE THE LATTER WHICH INCLUDED VARIOUS FORMS OF INDUSTRIAL EMPLOYMENT
LJ019-0320 WAS THE BOON TO WHICH WILLING INDUSTRY EXTENDING OVER A LONG PERIOD ESTABLISHED A CERTAIN CLAIM
LJ019-0321 THE INFLICTION OF PUNISHMENT MORE OR LESS UNIFORM WAS THUS AIMED AT
LJ019-0322 ON THE OTHER HAND NEW AND CAREFUL REGULATIONS WERE FRAMED TO SECURE THE MORAL AND MATERIAL WELLBEING OF THE INMATES OF THE JAILS
LJ019-0323 THE LAW MADE IT IMPERATIVE THAT EVERY PRISON SHOULD HAVE A PRISON CHAPEL AND THAT DAILY AND SUNDAY SERVICES SHOULD BE HELD
LJ019-0324 THE CHAPLAIN'S DUTIES WERE ENLARGED AND THE PRINCIPLE OF TOLERATION ACCEPTED TO THE EXTENT OF SECURING TO ALL PRISONERS
LJ019-0325 THE MINISTRATIONS OF MINISTERS OF THEIR OWN FORM OF BELIEF
LJ019-0326 STEPS WERE TAKEN TO PROVIDE THE ILLITERATE WITH SECULAR INSTRUCTION
LJ019-0327 NO LESS CLOSE WAS THE CARE AS REGARDS PRESERVATION OF HEALTH
LJ019-0328 STRINGENT RULES WERE PRESCRIBED FOR THE PRISON SURGEONS
LJ019-0329 EVERY PRISON WAS ORDERED TO KEEP UP AN INFIRMARY AND THE MEDICAL SUPERVISION WAS TO BE STRICT AND CONTINUOUS
LJ019-0330 DIETARIES WERE DRAWN UP FOR ADOPTION ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF A COMMITTEE OF EXPERTS
LJ019-0331 BATHS WERE PROVIDED ABLUTIONS ORDERED AND ALL APPLIANCES TO INSURE PERSONAL CLEANLINESS
LJ019-0332 THE ADMINISTRATION OF GOOD GOVERNMENT WAS TO BE WATCHED OVER BY THE LOCAL MAGISTRACY CERTAIN OF WHOM STYLED VISITING JUSTICES
LJ019-0333 WERE ELECTED TO INSPECT THE PRISONS FREQUENTLY TO EXAMINE THE PRISONERS HEAR COMPLAINTS AND CHECK ABUSES
LJ019-0334 UNDER THEM THE GOVERNOR OR JAILER WAS HELD STRICTLY RESPONSIBLE
LJ019-0335 THE BOOKS AND JOURNALS HE WAS TO KEEP WERE MINUTELY SPECIFIED AND HIS CONSTANT PRESENCE IN OR NEAR THE JAIL WAS INSISTED UPON
LJ019-0336 HIS DISCIPLINARY POWERS WERE DEFINED BY THE ACT AND HIS DUTIES
LJ019-0337 BOTH IN CONTROLLING HIS SUBORDINATES AND IN PROTECTING THE PRISONERS FROM PETTY TYRANNY AND OPPRESSION EVERY ONE OF WHOM HE WAS TO SEE ONCE EVERY TWENTYFOUR HOURS
LJ019-0338 BUT DISCIPLINE WAS TO BE MAINTAINED IF NECESSARY BY PUNISHMENT
LJ019-0339 WHILE DECENCY AND GOOD ORDER WERE TO BE INSURED BY THE STRICT PROHIBITION OF GAMBLING AND DRUNKENNESS
LJ019-0340 THE LATTER WAS RENDERED NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE BY THE PENALTIES IMPOSED ON PERSONS BRINGING SPIRITUOUS LIQUORS INTO THE JAIL
LJ019-0341 THE OLD CUSTOM SO FRUITFUL OF THE WORST EVILS OF KEEPING A TAP INSIDE THE PRISON WAS MADE ILLEGAL
LJ019-0342 SO WAS THE EMPLOYMENT OF PRISONERS IN ANY POSITION OF TRUST OR AUTHORITY
LJ019-0343 THEY WERE NOT TO BE TURNKEYS OR ASSISTANT TURNKEYS NEITHER WARDSMAN NOR YARDSMAN OVERSEER
LJ019-0344 MONITOR OR SCHOOLMASTER NOR TO BE ENGAGED IN THE SERVICE OF ANY OFFICER OF THE PRISON
LJ019-0345 THE ACT OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE ALSO ENCOURAGED AND EMPOWERED THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO ALTER ENLARGE OR REBUILD THEIR PRISONS
LJ019-0346 THEY MIGHT RAISE FUNDS FOR THIS PURPOSE PROVIDED A CERTIFICATE FOR THE NECESSITY FOR THE NEW WORKS WAS GIVEN EITHER BY THE RECORDER
LJ019-0347 CHAIRMAN OF QUARTER SESSIONS OR EVEN BY A COUPLE OF JUSTICES
LJ019-0348 EVERY FACILITY WAS PROMISED. THE SANCTION OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE WOULD NOT BE WITHHELD IF PLANS AND ESTIMATES WERE DULY SUBMITTED
LJ019-0349 AND THEY MET WITH THE APPROVAL OF HIS PROFESSIONAL ADVISER THE SURVEYORGENERAL OF PRISONS
LJ019-0350 THE FUNDS NECESSARY WOULD BE ADVANCED BY THE PUBLIC WORKS LOAN COMMISSIONERS AND THE INTEREST MIGHT BE CHARGED AGAINST THE COUNTY OR BOROUGH RATES
LJ019-0351 NOR WERE THESE THE ONLY INDUCEMENTS OFFERED. WHERE LOCAL AUTHORITIES WERE INDISPOSED TO SET THEIR PRISONS IN ORDER
LJ019-0352 OR HESITATED TO EMBARK UPON ANY CONSIDERABLE EXPENDITURE TO ALTER OR REBUILD
LJ019-0353 THEY WERE AT LIBERTY TO HIRE SUITABLE CELL ACCOMMODATION FROM ANY NEIGHBORS WHO MIGHT HAVE IT TO SPARE THE ONLY PROVISO
LJ019-0354 THAT NO SUCH CONTRACT WAS VALID BETWEEN ONE JURISDICTION AND ANOTHER UNLESS THE SECRETARY OF STATE WAS SATISFIED THAT THE PRISON IT WAS INTENDED TO USE
LJ019-0355 CAME UP IN ALL RESPECTS TO MODERN REQUIREMENTS
LJ019-0356 BUT THE ACT WAS NOT LIMITED TO PERMISSIVE LEGISLATION. ITS PROVISIONS AND ENACTMENTS WERE BACKED UP BY CERTAIN PENALTIES
LJ019-0357 THE SECRETARY OF STATE WAS EMPOWERED TO DEAL RATHER SUMMARILY WITH INADEQUATE PRISONS IN OTHER WORDS
LJ019-0358 WITH THOSE IN WHICH THERE WAS NO SEPARATION NO PROPER ENFORCEMENT OF HARD LABOR NO CHAPEL INFIRMARY AND SO FORTH
LJ019-0359 HE COULD IN THE FIRST PLACE WITHHOLD THE GOVERNMENT GRANT IN AID OF PRISON FUNDS BY REFUSING THE CERTIFICATE TO THE TREASURY UPON WHICH THE ALLOWANCE WAS PAID
LJ019-0360 THIS HE MIGHT DO ON THE REPRESENTATION OF THE INSPECTOR OF PRISONS
LJ019-0361 WHO WAS BOUND TO REPORT ANY DEFICIENCIES AND ABUSES HE MIGHT FIND AT HIS PERIODICAL VISITS THE SECRETARY OF STATE MIGHT GO FURTHER
LJ019-0362 WHERE THE LOCAL AUTHORITY HAD NEGLECTED TO COMPLY WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE ACT FOR FOUR CONSECUTIVE YEARS
LJ019-0363 HE COULD CLOSE THE INADEQUATE PRISON BY DECLARING IT UNFIT FOR THE RECEPTION OF PRISONERS
LJ019-0364 HIS ORDER WOULD AT THE SAME TIME SPECIFY SOME NEIGHBORING AND MORE SATISFACTORY PRISON WHICH THE LOCAL AUTHORITY WOULD BE COMPELLED TO UTILIZE INSTEAD
LJ019-0365 AND WITH THE CONCURRENCE OF THE OTHER AUTHORITY AND ON PAYMENT A FEW PROVISOS GOVERNED THESE RATHER EXTENSIVE POWERS
LJ019-0366 IT WAS NECESSARY FOR INSTANCE TO GIVE DUE NOTICE WHEN THE GOVERNMENT GRANT WAS TO BE WITHDRAWN
LJ019-0367 AND WITH THE WARNING A COPY OF THE PARTICULAR DEFECTS AND ALLEGATIONS WAS TO BE SENT TO THE LOCAL AUTHORITY
LJ019-0368 THE LATTER TOO WAS TO BE LAID BEFORE THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
LJ019-0369 IN THE SAME WAY SIX MONTHS' NOTICE WAS REQUIRED IN CASES WHERE THE CLOSING OF A PRISON WAS CONTEMPLATED
LJ019-0370 BUT IF THESE CONDITIONS WERE OBSERVED THE SECRETARY OF STATE COULD DEAL SHARPLY ENOUGH WITH THE DEFAULTING JURISDICTIONS
LJ019-0371 YET THE LAW WAS SELDOM IF EVER ENFORCED
LJ019-0372 IT WAS PRACTICALLY INOPERATIVE AS REGARDS THE PENALTIES FOR NEGLECT. IT WAS NO DOUBT AS IRKSOME AND INCONVENIENT TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE
LJ019-0373 TO AVAIL HIMSELF OF HIS POWERS AS IT WAS DIFFICULT TO BRING HOME THE DERELICTIONS OF DUTIES AND EVASION OF THE ACTS. TOO MUCH WAS LEFT TO THE INSPECTORS
LJ019-0374 IT WAS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO EXERCISE A VERY CLOSE SUPERVISION OVER THE WHOLE OF THE PRISONS OF THE COUNTRY
LJ019-0375 THERE WERE ONLY TWO OF THEM AND THEY COULD NOT VISIT EACH PRISON MORE THAN ONCE IN EACH YEAR SOMETIMES NOT OFTENER THAN ONCE IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS
LJ019-0376 THE TASK IMPOSED UPON THEM TENDING AS IT DID TO THE IMPOSITION OF A FINE UPON THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES WAS NOT A PLEASANT ONE
LJ019-0377 AND IT IS NOT STRANGE IF THEY DID NOT VERY FREQUENTLY HAND UP THE OFFENDERS TO THE REPROOF AND CORRECTION OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE
LJ019-0378 AS THE ALMOST INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCE WHILE THE MORE GLARING DEFECTS IN PRISON MANAGEMENT DISAPPEARED
LJ019-0379 MATTERS WENT ON AFTER THE EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE ACT MUCH THE SAME AS THEY HAD DONE BEFORE. DISTRICTS DIFFERED GREATLY IN THE ATTENTION THEY PAID TO PRISON AFFAIRS
LJ019-0380 IN ONE PART THE MOST PRAISEWORTHY ACTIVITY PREVAILED
LJ019-0381 IN ANOTHER THERE WAS HALFHEARTEDNESS EVEN APATHY AND AN ALMOST COMPLETE CONTEMPT FOR THE PROVISIONS OF THE ACT
LJ019-0382 AS THE YEARS PASSED GREAT WANT OF UNIFORMITY CONTINUED TO PREVAIL THROUGHOUT THE PRISONS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM
LJ019-0383 THE WHOLE QUESTION ASSUMED SUFFICIENT IMPORTANCE TO BECOME A PART OF THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM WHEN LORD BEACONSFIELD TOOK OFFICE IN 1874
LJ019-0384 THE HOME SECRETARY IN THAT ADMINISTRATION
LJ019-0385 MR. NOW SIR RICHARD CROSS HAVING APPLIED HIMSELF VIGOROUSLY TO THE TASK OF REORGANIZING THE WHOLE SYSTEM BECAME CONVINCED
LJ019-0386 THAT NO COMPLETE REFORM COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED SO LONG AS THE PRISONS WERE LEFT UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES
LJ019-0387 THE PRISONS BILL OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX CONTEMPLATED THE TRANSFER OF THE PRISONS TO GOVERNMENT
LJ019-0388 THIS BILL REINTRODUCED IN 1877 BECAME LAW THAT YEAR AFTER WHICH THE WHOLE OF THE PRISONS INCLUDING NEWGATE
LJ019-0389 PASSED UNDER THE MORE DIRECT CONTROL OF THE STATE
LJ019-0390 SINCE THEN A STRONG CENTRAL AUTHORITY HAS LABORED STEADFASTLY TO COMPASS CONCENTRATION
LJ019-0391 TO CLOSE USELESS PRISONS AND TO INSURE THAT UNIFORMITY OF SYSTEM WHICH ALL THOUGHTFUL PERSONS HAD LONG ADMITTED TO BE OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE
LJ019-0392 IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF PRISONS
LJ019-0393 THREE YEARS AFTER THE ADVENT OF THE PRISON COMMISSIONERS IT WAS DECIDED THAT NEWGATE WAS AN EXCESSIVELY COSTLY AND REDUNDANT ESTABLISHMENT
LJ019-0394 IT WAS ONLY FILLED AT THE PERIODS WHEN THE SESSIONS OF THE CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT WERE IN PROGRESS
LJ019-0395 AT OTHERS AN EXPENSIVE STAFF WAS MAINTAINED WITH LITTLE OR NOTHING TO DO
LJ019-0396 AT A SHORT DISTANCE STOOD ANOTHER PRISON OF DETENTION THAT OF CLERKENWELL
LJ019-0397 WITH SPARE ACCOMMODATION SUFFICIENT TO RECEIVE ALL PRISONERS WHO WERE THEN COMMITTED TO NEWGATE. THESE ARGUMENTS WERE UNANSWERABLE
LJ019-0398 ACCORDINGLY IT WAS ORDERED BY SIR WILLIAM HARCOURT THE PRESENT SECRETARY OF STATE THAT NEWGATE SHOULD CEASE TO BE USED AS A REGULAR PRISON
LJ019-0399 AND IT IS NOW EXCEPT DURING SESSIONS OR WHEN THE GALLOWS IS IN REQUISITION PRACTICALLY AND FOR EVER CLOSED
LJ020-0001 MARION HARLAND'S COOKERY FOR BEGINNERS. BREAD SPONGE AND BREAKFAST BREADS
LJ020-0002 BREAD RAISED WITH WHAT IS KNOWN TO BAKERS AS A “SPONGE” REQUIRES MORE TIME AND A TRIFLE MORE WORK THAN THE SIMPLER FORM FOR WHICH I HAVE JUST ALREADY GIVEN DIRECTIONS
LJ020-0003 BUT IT KEEPS FRESH LONGER IS SOFTER AND MORE NUTRITIOUS AND A SECONDRATE BRAND OF FLOUR THUS TREATED PRODUCES A BETTER LOAF
LJ020-0004 THAN WHEN MIXED UP WITH YEAST AND WATER ONLY
LJ020-0005 SPONGEMAKING IS THEREFORE AN IMPORTANT IF NOT AN ESSENTIAL ACCOMPLISHMENT IN A COOK BE SHE NOVICE OR VETERAN
LJ020-0006 THREE POTATOES OF FAIR SIZE PEELED AND BOILED MEALY
LJ020-0007 FIVE TABLESPOONFULS OF YEAST. ONE TABLESPOONFUL OF WHITE SUGAR
LJ020-0008 ONE TABLESPOONFUL OF BUTTER
LJ020-0009 THREE CUPS OF LUKEWARM WATER IN WHICH THE POTATOES WERE BOILED STRAINED THROUGH A COARSE CLOTH
LJ020-0010 ONE HEAPING CUP OF SIFTED FLOUR
LJ020-0011 PUT THE POTATOES INTO A LARGE BOWL OR TRAY AND MASH THEM TO POWDER WITH A POTATO BEETLE OR A WOODEN SPOON
LJ020-0012 WHILE STILL HOT MIX IN THE SUGAR AND BUTTER BEATING ALL TO A LUMPLESS CREAM
LJ020-0013 ADD A FEW SPOONFULS AT A TIME THE POTATOWATER ALTERNATELY WITH THE FLOUR BY THE HANDFUL
LJ020-0014 BEATING THE BATTER SMOOTH AS YOU GO ON UNTIL ALL OF THE LIQUID AND FLOUR HAS GONE IN
LJ020-0015 BEAT HARD ONE MINUTE BEFORE POURING IN THE YEAST
LJ020-0016 IT IS WELL TO STIR INTO THE YEAST A BIT OF SODA NO LARGER THAN A GRAIN OF CORN ALREADY WET UP IN A TEASPOONFUL OF BOILING WATER
LJ020-0017 NOW WHIP UP THE BATTER WITH A WOODEN SPOON FOR ANOTHER MINUTE AND THE SPONGE IS MADE
LJ020-0018 THROW A CLOTH OVER THE BOWL AND SET BY FOR FIVE OR SIX HOURS TO RISE
LJ020-0019 IF YOU INTEND TO BAKE IN THE FORENOON MAKE THE SPONGE AT BEDTIME. IF IN THE AFTERNOON EARLY IN THE MORNING
LJ020-0020 WHEN THE SPONGE IS LIGHT SIFT A QUART AND A CUP OF FLOUR INTO A BOWL OR TRAY WITH TWO TEASPOONFULS OF SALT
LJ020-0021 INTO A HOLLOW LIKE A CRATER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOUR EMPTY YOUR SPONGEBOWL AND WORK THE FLOUR DOWN INTO IT
LJ020-0022 WASH OUT THE BOWL WITH A LITTLE LUKEWARM WATER AND ADD THIS TO THE DOUGH. IF IT SHOULD PROVE TOO SOFT WORK IN CAUTIOUSLY A LITTLE MORE FLOUR
LJ020-0023 IF TOO STIFF WARM WATER A SPOONFUL AT A TIME UNTIL YOU CAN HANDLE THE PASTE EASILY. THE DANGER IS IN GETTING IT TOO STIFF. NOW
LJ020-0024 KNEAD AND SET FOR RISINGS FIRST AND SECOND AS YOU HAVE ALREADY BEEN INSTRUCTED. THIS SPONGE WILL BE FOUND ESPECIALLY USEFUL IN MAKING GRAHAM BREAD
LJ020-0025 ONE QUART OF GRAHAM FLOUR ONE CUP OF WHITE FLOUR
LJ020-0026 ONE HALF CUP OF INDIAN MEAL. ONE HALF CUP OF MOLASSES. TWO TEASPOONFULS OF SALT. SODA THE SIZE OF A PEA
LJ020-0027 HALF THE QUANTITY OF SPONGE GIVEN IN PRECEDING RECEIPT
LJ020-0028 WARM WATER FOR RINSING BOWL  ABOUT HALF A CUP
LJ020-0029 PUT THE BROWN OR GRAHAM FLOUR UNSIFTED INTO THE BREADBOWL
LJ020-0030 SIFT INTO IT WHITE FLOUR MEAL AND SALT AND STIR UP WELL WHILE DRY
LJ020-0031 INTO THE “CRATER” DUG OUT IN THE MIDDLE POUR THE SPONGE WARM WATER THE MOLASSES AND SODA DISSOLVED IN HOT WATER
LJ020-0032 KNEAD AS YOU WOULD WHITE BREAD AND SET ASIDE FOR THE RISING
LJ020-0033 IT WILL NOT SWELL SO FAST AS THE WHITE SO GIVE YOURSELF MORE TIME FOR MAKING IT
LJ020-0034 WHEN LIGHT KNEAD WELL AND LONG
LJ020-0035 MAKE INTO TWO LOAVES THEN PUT INTO WELLGREASED PANS AND LEAVE FOR AN HOUR OR UNTIL IT BECOMES MORE THAN TWICE THE ORIGINAL SIZE OF THE DOUGH
LJ020-0036 TAKE CARE THAT IT DOES NOT BURN IN BAKING. THE MOLASSES RENDERS IT LIABLE TO SCORCHING
LJ020-0037 THE OVEN MUST BE STEADY BUT NOT SO HOT AS FOR WHITE BREAD NOR WILL THE GRAHAM BREAD BE DONE QUITE SO SOON AS THAT MADE OF BOLTED FLOUR
LJ020-0038 TURN THE PANS ONCE WHILE BAKING MOVING THEM AS GENTLY AS POSSIBLE
LJ020-0039 IF RUDELY SHAKEN OR JARRED THERE WILL BE HEAVY STREAKS IN LOAVES
LJ020-0040 GRAHAM BREAD IS WHOLESOME AND SWEET AND OUGHT TO BE EATEN FREQUENTLY IN EVERY FAMILY PARTICULARLY BY YOUNG PEOPLE WHOSE BONES AND TEETH ARE IN FORMING
LJ020-0041 THE PHOSPHATES WHICH THE PROCESS OF “BOLTING” REMOVES TO A LARGE EXTENT FROM WHITE FLOUR GO DIRECTLY TO THE MANUFACTURE OF BONE
LJ020-0042 AND THESE ALSO TEND TO NOURISH AND STRENGTHEN THE BRAIN
LJ020-0043 AFTER MIXING YOUR BREAD IN THE MORNING EITHER WITH SPONGE OR WITH YEAST DIVIDE THE KNEADED DOUGH INTO TWO PORTIONS
LJ020-0044 MOULD ONE INTO A ROUND BALL AND SET ASIDE FOR A LOAF AS ALREADY DIRECTED
LJ020-0045 MAKE A HOLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OTHER BATCH AND POUR INTO IT A TABLESPOONFUL OF BUTTER JUST MELTED BUT NOT HOT
LJ020-0046 CLOSE THE DOUGH OVER IT DUST YOUR HANDS AND KNEADINGBOARD WITH FLOUR AND WORK IN THE SHORTENING UNTIL THE DOUGH IS ELASTIC AND CEASES TO BE STICKY
LJ020-0047 PUT IT INTO A FLOURED BOWL COVER WITH A CLOTH AND SET AWAY OUT OF DRAUGHT AND UNDUE HEAT FOR THREE HOURS
LJ020-0048 KNEAD IT AGAIN THEN AND WAIT UPON ITS RISING FOR ANOTHER THREE HOURS. THE DOUGH SHOULD BE AS SOFT AS CAN BE HANDLED
LJ020-0049 WHEN IT IS LIGHT FOR THE SECOND TIME FLOUR YOUR BOARD RUBBING IN THE FLOUR AND BLOWING LIGHTLY AWAY WHAT DOES NOT ADHERE TO THE SURFACE
LJ020-0050 TOSS THE LUMP DOUGH UPON IT AND KNEAD THOROUGHLY FOR FIVE MINUTES
LJ020-0051 FLOUR A ROLLINGPIN AND ROLL THE DOUGH INTO A SHEET NOT MORE THAN HALF AN INCH THICK
LJ020-0052 CUT THIS INTO ROUND CAKES WITH A BISCUITCUTTER OR A SHARPEDGED TUMBLER AND FOLD NOT QUITE IN THE MIDDLE
LJ020-0053 IN THE FORM OF TURNOVERS PINCHING THE CORNERS OF THE FOLD PRETTY HARD TO HINDER THE FLAP OF DOUGH FROM FLYING UP AS THE RISING PROCEEDS
LJ020-0054 RUB THE BOTTOM AND SIDES OF A BAKINGPAN WITH SWEET LARD OR BUTTER. DO THIS WITH A BIT OF CLEAN SOFT RAG OR TISSUEPAPER
LJ020-0055 VISITING EVERY CORNER OF THE PAN BUT NOT LEAVING THICK LAYERS AND STREAKS OF GREASE AFTER IT
LJ020-0056 ARRANGE THE ROLLS IN REGULAR ROWS IN THE PAN ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN INCH APART
LJ020-0057 COVER WITH A CLOTH AND SET NEARER THE FIRE THAN YOU DARED TRUST THE DOUGH AND LET THEM RISE FOR AN HOUR
LJ020-0058 PEEP UNDER THE CLOTH TWO OR THREE TIMES TO SEE WHETHER THEY RISE EVENLY AND TURN THE PAN AROUND ONCE THAT ALL MAY BE EQUALLY EXPOSED TO THE HEAT
LJ020-0059 WHEN THE TIME IS UP AND THE ROLLS ARE PUFFY AND PROMISING SET THEM IN A PRETTY QUICK OVEN AND BAKE HALF AN HOUR
LJ020-0060 TURNING THE PAN ONCE IN THIS TIME AND COVERING WITH CLEAN  NEVER PRINTED  PAPER SHOULD THEY BROWN TOO FAST
LJ020-0061 BREAK THE ROLLS APART FROM ONE ANOTHER AND EAT WARM. THEY ARE ALSO GOOD COLD AND IF THE DIRECTIONS BE FOLLOWED IMPLICITLY VERY GOOD ALWAYS
LJ020-0062 GRAHAM ROLLS ARE MADE BY TREATING THE DOUGH MIXED FOR GRAHAM BREAD AS ABOVE AND FOLLOWING THE FOREGOING RECEIPT IN EVERY SECTION BUT ALLOWING MORE TIME FOR RISING AND BAKING
LJ020-0063 THEY ARE EVEN BETTER WHEN COLD THAN HOT
LJ020-0064 BREAKFAST BISCUIT
LJ020-0065 TWO CUPS OF FRESH MILK SLIGHTLY WARMED
LJ020-0066 ONE QUART AND A CUP OF FLOUR SIFTED
LJ020-0067 FIVE TABLESPOONFULS OF YEAST
LJ020-0068 ONE EVEN TABLESPOONFUL OF WHITE SUGAR
LJ020-0069 ONE EVEN TEASPOONFUL OF SALT
LJ020-0070 BIT OF SODA AS LARGE AS A PEA DISSOLVED IN HOT WATER
LJ020-0071 ONE TABLESPOONFUL OF BUTTER JUST MELTED NOT HOT
LJ020-0072 YOLK OF ONE EGG BEATEN LIGHT
LJ020-0073 SIFT THE FLOUR SALT AND SUGAR INTO A BOWL
LJ020-0074 HOLLOW THE HEAP IN THE CENTER AND POUR IN THE MILK WORKING DOWN THE FLOUR INTO THE LIQUID WITH A SPOON OR YOUR HANDS UNTIL IT IS THOROUGHLY MELTED
LJ020-0075 INTO A SECOND HOLLOW POUR THE YEAST AND KNEAD THOROUGHLY FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES
LJ020-0076 WRAP BOWL AND BISCUIT IN A THICK CLOTH AND SET TO RISE WHERE IT WILL NEITHER BECOME CHILLED NOR SOUR OVER NIGHT
LJ020-0077 STUDY THE TEMPERATURE IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE KITCHEN AND KITCHEN CLOSETS TO THE END OF FINDING THE BEST PLACES FOR RAISING DOUGH AND SPONGE
LJ020-0078 DO ALL THIS AT BEDTIME. EARLY IN THE MORNING TURN OUT THE DOUGH UPON A FLOURED BOARD WORK IT FOR A MINUTE INTO MANAGEABLE SHAPE
LJ020-0079 DRILL SEVERAL FINGERHOLES IN IT AND FILL THEM WITH THE MELTED BUTTER THE DISSOLVED SODA AND THE BEATEN YOLK OF EGG
LJ020-0080 PINCH THE DOUGH HARD TO STOP THE MOUTHS OF THESE CAVITIES
LJ020-0081 AND KNEAD FOR TEN MINUTES CAREFULLY AT FIRST LEST THE LIQUIDS SHOULD BE WASTED AND MORE BOLDLY WHEN THEY ARE ABSORBED BY THE PASTE
LJ020-0082 ROLL OUT INTO A SHEET HALF AN INCH THICK WITH A FLOURED ROLLINGPIN CUT INTO ROUND CAKES SET THESE CLOSELY TOGETHER IN A WELLGREASED PAN
LJ020-0083 PRICK EACH WITH A FORK AND LET THEM RISE NEAR THE FIRE FOR HALF AN HOUR COVERED WITH A LIGHT CLOTH
LJ020-0084 BAKE FROM TWENTY TO TWENTYFIVE MINUTES IN A QUICK OVEN TURNING THE PAN AROUND ONCE QUICKLY AND LIGHTLY
LJ020-0085 BREAK APART FROM ONE ANOTHER AND PILE ON A PLATE THROWING A CLEAN DOILY OR A SMALL NAPKIN OVER THEM. BREAK OPEN AT TABLE
LJ020-0086 HOT ROLLS AND MUFFINS SHOULD NEVER BE CUT
LJ020-0087 ONE WORD WITH REGARD TO GETTING UP EARLY IN ORDER TO GIVE DOUGH A CHANCE FOR THE SECOND RISING
LJ020-0088 IT IS NOT A WHOLESOME PRACTICE FOR ANY WOMAN  LEAST OF ALL A YOUNG GIRL TO BE OUT OF BED TWO HOURS BEFORE SHE EATS HER BREAKFAST
LJ020-0089 STUDYING UPON AN EMPTY STOMACH PROVOKES DYSPEPSIA AND INJURES THE EYES
LJ020-0090 ACTIVE EXERCISE IN LIKE CIRCUMSTANCES TEMPTS DEBILITY AND DISEASE
LJ020-0091 YET OUR BREAD AND ROLLS MUST BE LOOKED AFTER AT THE PROPER TIME
LJ020-0092 HAVE YOURSELF CALLED ON BISCUIT MORNINGS AN HOUR EARLIER THAN USUAL
LJ020-0093 RISE WASH FACE AND HANDS RINSE THE MOUTH OUT AND BRUSH BACK THE HAIR
LJ020-0094 PUT ON STOCKINGS AND SLIPPERS SUCH UNDERCLOTHING AS MAY BE NEEDED TO PREVENT COLD A WRAPPER AND THE KITCHEN APRON
LJ020-0095 COVER YOUR HAIR ENTIRELY WITH A HANDKERCHIEF OR SWEEPING CAP
LJ020-0096 BEFORE BEGINNING OPERATIONS DOWNSTAIRS EAT A HALFSLICE OF DRY BREAD OR A BISCUIT
LJ020-0097 YOU WILL NOT RELISH IT BUT TAKE IT ALL THE SAME TO APPEASE THE EMPTY DISCONTENTED STOMACH
LJ020-0098 HAVING MADE OUT YOUR ROLLS AND TUCKED THEM UP SNUGLY FOR THE FINAL RISE RETURN TO YOUR CHAMBER FOR A COMFORTABLE BATH AND TOILET
LJ020-0099 WHEN HABITED FOR THE DAY IN ALL EXCEPT THE OUTER GOWN COLLAR ETC. SLIP ON THE WRAPPER AGAIN AND RUN DOWN TO PUT THE BISCUITS IN THE OVEN
LJ020-0100 UNLESS IT IS TOO HOT THEY WILL GET NO HARM WHILE YOU FINISH DRESSING IN TEN MINUTES JUST IN SEASON TO TURN THE PAN
LJ020-0101 FROM THE BEGINNING OF YOUR APPRENTICESHIP IN HOUSEWIFERY LEARN HOW TO DOVETAIL YOUR DUTIES NEATLY INTO ONE ANOTHER
LJ020-0102 A WISE ACCOMMODATION OF PARTS AND ANGLES AND COMPACTNESS IN THE ADJUSTMENT OF MUSTBEDONES
LJ020-0103 ARE BETTER THAN MERE PERSONAL STRENGTH IN THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF SUCH TASKS AS FALL TO WOMEN TO PERFORM
LJ020-0104 MASTER THESE AND DO NOT LET THEM MASTER YOU
LJ020-0105 WEAVE THE LITTLE DUTIES IN AND UNDER AND AMONG WHAT SEEM TO BE THE GREATER
LJ020-0106 WHILE YOUR BREAD IS TAKING A THREE HOURS’ RISE YOU ARE FREE IN BODY AND MIND FOR OTHER THINGS
LJ020-0107 THE GRAND SECRET OF KEEPING HOUSE WELL AND WITHOUT WORRY LIES IN THE ART OF PACKING AND FITTING DIFFERENT KINDS OF WORK AND IN PICKING UP THE MINUTES
LJ020-0108 OTHER THINGS BESIDES RISING DOUGH GET ON QUITE AS WELL WITHOUT YOUR STANDING BY TO WATCH THEM
LJ021-0001 THE FIRESIDE CHATS OF FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT BY FRANKLIN D ROOSEVELT SECTION SIX
LJ021-0002 SEPTEMBER 30 NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR
LJ021-0003 THREE MONTHS HAVE PASSED SINCE I TALKED WITH YOU SHORTLY AFTER THE ADJOURNMENT OF THE CONGRESS
LJ021-0004 TONIGHT I CONTINUE THAT REPORT THOUGH BECAUSE OF THE SHORTNESS OF TIME I MUST DEFER A NUMBER OF SUBJECTS TO A LATER DATE
LJ021-0005 RECENTLY THE MOST NOTABLE PUBLIC QUESTIONS THAT HAVE CONCERNED US ALL
LJ021-0006 HAVE HAD TO DO WITH INDUSTRY AND LABOR AND WITH RESPECT TO THESE CERTAIN DEVELOPMENTS HAVE TAKEN PLACE WHICH I CONSIDER OF IMPORTANCE
LJ021-0007 I AM HAPPY TO REPORT THAT AFTER YEARS OF UNCERTAINTY CULMINATING IN THE COLLAPSE OF THE SPRING OF NINETEEN THIRTY THREE
LJ021-0008 WE ARE BRINGING ORDER OUT OF THE OLD CHAOS
LJ021-0009 WITH A GREATER CERTAINTY OF THE EMPLOYMENT OF LABOR AT A REASONABLE WAGE AND OF MORE BUSINESS AT A FAIR PROFIT
LJ021-0010 THESE GOVERNMENTAL AND INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENTS HOLD PROMISE OF NEW ACHIEVEMENTS FOR THE NATION
LJ021-0011 MEN MAY DIFFER AS TO THE PARTICULAR FORM OF GOVERNMENTAL ACTIVITY
LJ021-0012 WITH RESPECT TO INDUSTRY AND BUSINESS BUT NEARLY ALL ARE AGREED THAT PRIVATE ENTERPRISE IN TIMES SUCH AS THESE
LJ021-0014 BUT ALSO OUR PROCESSES OF CIVILIZATION
LJ021-0015 THE UNDERLYING NECESSITY FOR SUCH ACTIVITY
LJ021-0016 IS INDEED AS STRONG NOW AS IT WAS YEARS AGO WHEN ELIHU ROOT SAID THE FOLLOWING VERY SIGNIFICANT WORDS
LJ021-0017 INSTEAD OF THE GIVE AND TAKE OF FREE INDIVIDUAL CONTRACT
LJ021-0018 THE TREMENDOUS POWER OF ORGANIZATION HAS COMBINED GREAT AGGREGATIONS OF CAPITAL IN ENORMOUS INDUSTRIAL ESTABLISHMENTS
LJ021-0019 WORKING THROUGH VAST AGENCIES OF COMMERCE AND EMPLOYING GREAT MASSES OF MEN IN MOVEMENTS OF PRODUCTION
LJ021-0020 AND TRANSPORTATION AND TRADE SO GREAT IN THE MASS THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL CONCERNED IN THEM IS QUITE HELPLESS BY HIMSELF
LJ021-0021 THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE EMPLOYER AND THE EMPLOYED BETWEEN THE OWNERS OF AGGREGATED CAPITAL AND THE UNITS OF ORGANIZED LABOR
LJ021-0022 BETWEEN THE SMALL PRODUCER THE SMALL TRADER THE CONSUMER
LJ021-0023 AND THE GREAT TRANSPORTING AND MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTING AGENCIES
LJ021-0024 ALL PRESENT NEW QUESTIONS FOR THE SOLUTION OF WHICH THE OLD RELIANCE UPON THE FREE ACTION OF INDIVIDUAL WILLS APPEARS QUITE INADEQUATE
LJ021-0025 AND IN MANY DIRECTIONS THE INTERVENTION OF THAT ORGANIZED CONTROL WHICH WE CALL GOVERNMENT
LJ021-0026 SEEMS NECESSARY TO PRODUCE THE SAME RESULT OF JUSTICE AND RIGHT CONDUCT
LJ021-0027 WHICH OBTAINED THROUGH THE ATTRITION OF INDIVIDUALS BEFORE THE NEW CONDITIONS AROSE
LJ021-0028 IT WAS IN THIS SPIRIT THUS DESCRIBED BY SECRETARY ROOT
LJ021-0029 THAT WE APPROACHED OUR TASK OF REVIVING PRIVATE ENTERPRISE IN MARCH NINETEEN THIRTY THREE
LJ021-0030 OUR FIRST PROBLEM WAS OF COURSE THE BANKING SITUATION BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW THE BANKS HAD COLLAPSED
LJ021-0031 SOME BANKS COULD NOT BE SAVED BUT THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THEM EITHER THROUGH THEIR OWN RESOURCES OR WITH GOVERNMENT AID
LJ021-0032 HAVE BEEN RESTORED TO COMPLETE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE
LJ021-0033 THIS HAS GIVEN SAFETY TO MILLIONS OF DEPOSITORS IN THESE BANKS
LJ021-0034 CLOSELY FOLLOWING THIS GREAT CONSTRUCTIVE EFFORT WE HAVE THROUGH VARIOUS FEDERAL AGENCIES
LJ021-0035 SAVED DEBTORS AND CREDITORS ALIKE IN MANY OTHER FIELDS OF ENTERPRISE SUCH AS LOANS ON FARM MORTGAGES AND HOME MORTGAGES
LJ021-0036 LOANS TO THE RAILROADS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES AND FINALLY HELP FOR HOME OWNERS AND INDUSTRY ITSELF
LJ021-0037 IN ALL OF THESE EFFORTS THE GOVERNMENT HAS COME TO THE ASSISTANCE OF BUSINESS
LJ021-0038 AND WITH THE FULL EXPECTATION THAT THE MONEY USED TO ASSIST THESE ENTERPRISES WILL EVENTUALLY BE REPAID
LJ021-0039 I BELIEVE IT WILL BE
LJ021-0040 THE SECOND STEP WE HAVE TAKEN IN THE RESTORATION OF NORMAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE
LJ021-0041 HAS BEEN TO CLEAN UP THOROUGHLY UNWHOLESOME CONDITIONS IN THE FIELD OF INVESTMENT
LJ021-0042 IN THIS WE HAVE HAD ASSISTANCE FROM MANY BANKERS AND BUSINESSMEN
LJ021-0043 MOST OF WHOM RECOGNIZE THE PAST EVILS IN THE BANKING SYSTEM IN THE SALE OF SECURITIES IN THE DELIBERATE ENCOURAGEMENT OF STOCK GAMBLING
LJ021-0044 IN THE SALE OF UNSOUND MORTGAGES AND IN MANY OTHER WAYS IN WHICH THE PUBLIC LOST BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
LJ021-0045 THEY SAW THAT WITHOUT CHANGES IN THE POLICIES AND METHODS OF INVESTMENT
LJ021-0046 THERE COULD BE NO RECOVERY OF PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE SECURITY OF SAVINGS
LJ021-0047 THE COUNTRY NOW ENJOYS THE SAFETY OF BANK SAVINGS UNDER THE NEW BANKING LAWS
LJ021-0048 THE CAREFUL CHECKING OF NEW SECURITIES UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT
LJ021-0049 AND THE CURTAILMENT OF RANK STOCK SPECULATION THROUGH THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT
LJ021-0050 I SINCERELY HOPE THAT AS A RESULT
LJ021-0051 PEOPLE WILL BE DISCOURAGED IN UNHAPPY EFFORTS TO GET RICH QUICK BY SPECULATING IN SECURITIES
LJ021-0052 THE AVERAGE PERSON ALMOST ALWAYS LOSES
LJ021-0053 ONLY A VERY SMALL MINORITY OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY BELIEVE IN GAMBLING AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE OLD PHILOSOPHY OF BENJAMIN FRANKLIN
LJ021-0054 THAT THE WAY TO WEALTH IS THROUGH WORK
LJ021-0055 IN MEETING THE PROBLEMS OF INDUSTRIAL RECOVERY THE CHIEF AGENCY OF THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN THE NATIONAL RECOVERY ADMINISTRATION
LJ021-0056 UNDER ITS GUIDANCE TRADES AND INDUSTRIES COVERING OVER 90 PERCENT OF ALL INDUSTRIAL EMPLOYEES
LJ021-0057 HAVE ADOPTED CODES OF FAIR COMPETITION WHICH HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY THE PRESIDENT
LJ021-0058 UNDER THESE CODES IN THE INDUSTRIES COVERED CHILD LABOR HAS BEEN ELIMINATED
LJ021-0059 THE WORK DAY AND THE WORK WEEK HAVE BEEN SHORTENED
LJ021-0060 MINIMUM WAGES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED AND OTHER WAGES ADJUSTED TOWARD A RISING STANDARD OF LIVING
LJ021-0061 THE EMERGENCY PURPOSE OF THE N.R.A. WAS TO PUT MEN TO WORK AND SINCE ITS CREATION MORE THAN FOUR MILLION PERSONS HAVE BEEN REEMPLOYED
LJ021-0062 IN GREAT PART THROUGH THE COOPERATION OF AMERICAN BUSINESS BROUGHT ABOUT UNDER THE CODES
LJ021-0063 BENEFITS OF THE INDUSTRIAL RECOVERY PROGRAM HAVE COME
LJ021-0064 NOT ONLY TO LABOR IN THE FORM OF NEW JOBS IN RELIEF FROM OVERWORK AND IN RELIEF FROM UNDERPAY
LJ021-0065 BUT ALSO TO THE OWNERS AND MANAGERS OF INDUSTRY BECAUSE
LJ021-0066 TOGETHER WITH A GREAT INCREASE IN THE PAYROLLS THERE HAS COME A SUBSTANTIAL RISE IN THE TOTAL OF INDUSTRIAL PROFITS
LJ021-0067 A RISE FROM A DEFICIT FIGURE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF NINETEEN THIRTY THREE
LJ021-0068 TO A LEVEL OF SUSTAINED PROFITS WITHIN ONE YEAR FROM THE INAUGURATION OF N.R.A
LJ021-0069 NOW IT SHOULD NOT BE EXPECTED THAT EVEN EMPLOYED LABOR AND CAPITAL WOULD BE COMPLETELY SATISFIED WITH PRESENT CONDITIONS
LJ021-0070 EMPLOYED WORKERS HAVE NOT BY ANY MEANS ALL ENJOYED A RETURN TO THE EARNINGS OF PROSPEROUS TIMES
LJ021-0071 ALTHOUGH MILLIONS OF HITHERTO UNDERPRIVILEGED WORKERS ARE TODAY FAR BETTER PAID THAN EVER BEFORE
LJ021-0072 ALSO BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF INVESTED CAPITAL HAVE TODAY A GREATER SECURITY OF PRESENT AND FUTURE EARNING POWER THAN BEFORE
LJ021-0073 THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF FAIR COMPETITIVE STANDARDS AND BECAUSE OF RELIEF FROM UNFAIR COMPETITION
LJ021-0074 IN WAGE CUTTING WHICH DEPRESSES MARKETS AND DESTROYS PURCHASING POWER
LJ021-0075 BUT IT IS AN UNDENIABLE FACT THAT THE RESTORATION OF OTHER BILLIONS OF SOUND INVESTMENTS TO A REASONABLE EARNING POWER
LJ021-0076 COULD NOT BE BROUGHT ABOUT IN ONE YEAR
LJ021-0077 THERE IS NO MAGIC FORMULA
LJ021-0078 NO ECONOMIC PANACEA WHICH COULD SIMPLY REVIVE OVERNIGHT THE HEAVY INDUSTRIES AND THE TRADES DEPENDENT UPON THEM
LJ021-0079 NEVERTHELESS THE GAINS OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIAL
LJ021-0080 IN THESE GAINS AND IN THE POLICIES OF THE ADMINISTRATION THERE ARE ASSURANCES THAT HEARTEN ALL FORWARD LOOKING MEN AND WOMEN
LJ021-0081 WITH THE CONFIDENCE THAT WE ARE DEFINITELY REBUILDING OUR POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SYSTEM ON THE LINES LAID DOWN BY THE NEW DEAL
LJ021-0082 LINES WHICH AS I HAVE SO OFTEN MADE CLEAR ARE IN COMPLETE ACCORD WITH THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES OF ORDERLY POPULAR GOVERNMENT
LJ021-0083 WHICH AMERICANS HAVE DEMANDED SINCE THE WHITE MAN FIRST CAME TO THESE SHORES
LJ021-0084 WE COUNT IN THE FUTURE AS IN THE PAST ON THE DRIVING POWER OF INDIVIDUAL INITIATIVE
LJ021-0085 AND THE INCENTIVE OF FAIR PRIVATE PROFIT
LJ021-0086 STRENGTHENED WITH THE ACCEPTANCE OF THOSE OBLIGATIONS TO THE PUBLIC INTEREST WHICH REST UPON US ALL
LJ021-0087 WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO EXPECT THAT THIS DRIVING POWER WILL BE GIVEN PATRIOTICALLY AND WHOLEHEARTEDLY TO OUR NATION
LJ021-0088 WE HAVE PASSED THROUGH THE FORMATIVE PERIOD OF CODE MAKING IN THE NATIONAL RECOVERY ADMINISTRATION
LJ021-0089 AND HAVE EFFECTED A REORGANIZATION OF THE N.R.A.
LJ021-0090 SUITED TO THE NEEDS OF THE NEXT PHASE WHICH IS IN TURN A PERIOD OF PREPARATION FOR LEGISLATION WHICH WILL DETERMINE ITS PERMANENT FORM
LJ021-0091 IN THIS RECENT REORGANIZATION WE HAVE RECOGNIZED THREE DISTINCT FUNCTIONS
LJ021-0092 FIRST THE LEGISLATIVE OR POLICY MAKING FUNCTION
LJ021-0093 SECOND THE ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTION OF CODE MAKING AND REVISION AND THIRD THE JUDICIAL FUNCTION WHICH INCLUDES ENFORCEMENT
LJ021-0094 CONSUMER COMPLAINTS AND THE SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES AND BETWEEN ONE EMPLOYER AND ANOTHER
LJ021-0095 WE ARE NOW PREPARED TO MOVE INTO THIS SECOND PHASE ON THE BASIS OF OUR EXPERIENCE IN THE FIRST PHASE
LJ021-0096 UNDER THE ABLE AND ENERGETIC LEADERSHIP OF GENERAL JOHNSON
LJ021-0097 WE SHALL WATCH CAREFULLY THE WORKING OF THIS NEW MACHINERY FOR THE SECOND PHASE OF N.R.A.
LJ021-0098 MODIFYING IT WHERE IT NEEDS MODIFICATION AND FINALLY MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE CONGRESS
LJ021-0099 IN ORDER THAT THE FUNCTIONS OF N.R.A. WHICH HAVE PROVED THEIR WORTH MAY BE MADE A PART OF THE PERMANENT MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT
LJ021-0100 LET ME CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT THE NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL RECOVERY ACT
LJ021-0101 GAVE BUSINESSMEN THE OPPORTUNITY THEY HAD SOUGHT FOR YEARS TO IMPROVE BUSINESS CONDITIONS THROUGH WHAT HAS BEEN CALLED SELFGOVERNMENT IN INDUSTRY
LJ021-0102 IF THE CODES WHICH HAVE BEEN WRITTEN HAVE BEEN TOO COMPLICATED
LJ021-0103 IF THEY HAVE GONE TOO FAR IN SUCH MATTERS AS PRICE FIXING AND LIMITATION OF PRODUCTION
LJ021-0104 LET IT BE REMEMBERED THAT SO FAR AS POSSIBLE CONSISTENT WITH THE IMMEDIATE PUBLIC INTEREST OF THIS PAST YEAR
LJ021-0105 AND THE VITAL NECESSITY OF IMPROVING LABOR CONDITIONS
LJ021-0106 THE REPRESENTATIVES OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY WERE PERMITTED TO WRITE THEIR IDEAS INTO THE CODES
LJ021-0107 IT IS NOW TIME TO REVIEW THESE ACTIONS AS A WHOLE TO DETERMINE THROUGH DELIBERATIVE MEANS IN THE LIGHT OF EXPERIENCE
LJ021-0108 FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE GOOD OF THE INDUSTRIES THEMSELVES AS WELL AS THE GENERAL PUBLIC INTEREST
LJ021-0109 WHETHER THE METHODS AND POLICIES ADOPTED IN THE EMERGENCY
LJ021-0110 HAVE BEEN BEST CALCULATED TO PROMOTE INDUSTRIAL RECOVERY AND A PERMANENT IMPROVEMENT OF BUSINESS AND LABOR CONDITIONS
LJ021-0111 THERE MAY BE A SERIOUS QUESTION AS TO THE WISDOM OF MANY OF THOSE DEVICES TO CONTROL PRODUCTION
LJ021-0112 OR TO PREVENT DESTRUCTIVE PRICE CUTTING WHICH MANY BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS HAVE INSISTED WERE NECESSARY
LJ021-0113 OR WHETHER THEIR EFFECT MAY HAVE BEEN TO PREVENT THAT VOLUME OF PRODUCTION WHICH WOULD MAKE POSSIBLE LOWER PRICES AND INCREASED EMPLOYMENT
LJ021-0114 ANOTHER QUESTION ARISES AS TO WHETHER IN FIXING MINIMUM WAGES ON THE BASIS OF AN HOURLY OR WEEKLY WAGE
LJ021-0115 WE HAVE REACHED INTO THE HEART OF THE PROBLEM WHICH IS TO PROVIDE SUCH ANNUAL EARNINGS FOR THE LOWEST PAID WORKER AS WILL MEET HIS MINIMUM NEEDS
LJ021-0116 WE ALSO QUESTION THE WISDOM OF EXTENDING CODE REQUIREMENTS SUITED TO THE GREAT INDUSTRIAL CENTERS AND TO LARGE EMPLOYERS
LJ021-0117 TO THE GREAT NUMBER OF SMALL EMPLOYERS IN THE SMALLER COMMUNITIES
LJ021-0118 DURING THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS OUR INDUSTRIAL RECOVERY HAS BEEN TO SOME EXTENT RETARDED BY STRIKES
LJ021-0119 INCLUDING A FEW OF MAJOR IMPORTANCE
LJ021-0120 I WOULD NOT MINIMIZE THE INEVITABLE LOSSES TO EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES AND TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC THROUGH SUCH CONFLICTS
LJ021-0121 BUT I WOULD POINT OUT THAT THE EXTENT AND SEVERITY OF LABOR DISPUTES DURING THIS PERIOD
LJ021-0122 HAS BEEN FAR LESS THAN IN ANY PREVIOUS COMPARABLE PERIOD
LJ021-0123 WHEN THE BUSINESSMEN OF THE COUNTRY WERE DEMANDING THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE THEMSELVES ADEQUATELY TO PROMOTE THEIR LEGITIMATE INTERESTS
LJ021-0124 WHEN THE FARMERS WERE DEMANDING LEGISLATION WHICH WOULD GIVE THEM OPPORTUNITIES AND INCENTIVES TO ORGANIZE THEMSELVES FOR A COMMON ADVANCE
LJ021-0125 IT WAS NATURAL THAT THE WORKERS SHOULD SEEK AND OBTAIN A STATUTORY DECLARATION OF THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT
LJ021-0126 TO ORGANIZE THEMSELVES FOR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AS EMBODIED IN SECTION 7 A OF THE NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL RECOVERY ACT
LJ021-0127 MACHINERY SET UP BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS PROVIDED SOME NEW METHODS OF ADJUSTMENT
LJ021-0128 BOTH EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES MUST SHARE THE BLAME OF NOT USING THEM AS FULLY AS THEY SHOULD
LJ021-0129 THE EMPLOYER WHO TURNS AWAY FROM IMPARTIAL AGENCIES OF PEACE
LJ021-0130 WHO DENIES FREEDOM OF ORGANIZATION TO HIS EMPLOYEES OR FAILS TO MAKE EVERY REASONABLE EFFORT AT A PEACEFUL SOLUTION OF THEIR DIFFERENCES
LJ021-0131 IS NOT FULLY SUPPORTING THE RECOVERY EFFORT OF HIS GOVERNMENT
LJ021-0132 THE WORKERS WHO TURN AWAY FROM THESE SAME IMPARTIAL AGENCIES AND DECLINE TO USE THEIR GOOD OFFICES TO GAIN THEIR ENDS
LJ021-0133 ARE LIKEWISE NOT FULLY COOPERATING WITH THEIR GOVERNMENT
LJ021-0134 IT IS TIME THAT WE MADE A CLEANCUT EFFORT TO BRING ABOUT THAT UNITED ACTION OF MANAGEMENT AND LABOR
LJ021-0135 WHICH IS ONE OF THE HIGH PURPOSES OF THE RECOVERY ACT
LJ021-0136 WE HAVE PASSED THROUGH MORE THAN A YEAR OF EDUCATION
LJ021-0137 STEP BY STEP WE HAVE CREATED ALL THE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES NECESSARY TO INSURE AS A GENERAL RULE INDUSTRIAL PEACE
LJ021-0138 WITH JUSTICE FOR ALL THOSE WILLING TO USE THESE AGENCIES WHENEVER THEIR VOLUNTARY BARGAINING FAILS TO PRODUCE A NECESSARY AGREEMENT
LJ021-0139 THERE SHOULD BE AT LEAST A FULL AND FAIR TRIAL GIVEN TO THESE MEANS OF ENDING INDUSTRIAL WARFARE
LJ021-0140 AND IN SUCH AN EFFORT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SECURE FOR EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES AND CONSUMERS
LJ021-0141 THE BENEFITS THAT ALL DERIVE FROM THE CONTINUOUS PEACEFUL OPERATION OF OUR ESSENTIAL ENTERPRISES
LJ021-0142 ACCORDINGLY I PROPOSE TO CONFER WITHIN THE COMING MONTH
LJ021-0143 WITH SMALL GROUPS OF THOSE TRULY REPRESENTATIVE OF LARGE EMPLOYERS OF LABOR AND OF LARGE GROUPS OF ORGANIZED LABOR
LJ021-0144 IN ORDER TO SEEK THEIR COOPERATION IN ESTABLISHING WHAT I MAY DESCRIBE AS A SPECIFIC TRIAL PERIOD OF INDUSTRIAL PEACE
LJ021-0145 FROM THOSE WILLING TO JOIN IN ESTABLISHING THIS HOPEDFOR PERIOD OF PEACE
LJ021-0146 I SHALL SEEK ASSURANCES OF THE MAKING AND MAINTENANCE OF AGREEMENTS WHICH CAN BE MUTUALLY RELIED UPON
LJ021-0147 UNDER WHICH WAGES HOURS AND WORKING CONDITIONS
LJ021-0148 MAY BE DETERMINED AND ANY LATER ADJUSTMENTS SHALL BE MADE EITHER BY AGREEMENT OR IN CASE OF DISAGREEMENT
LJ021-0149 THROUGH THE MEDIATION OR ARBITRATION OF STATE OR FEDERAL AGENCIES
LJ021-0150 I SHALL NOT ASK EITHER EMPLOYERS OR EMPLOYEES PERMANENTLY TO LAY ASIDE THE WEAPONS COMMON TO INDUSTRIAL WAR
LJ021-0151 BUT I SHALL ASK BOTH GROUPS TO GIVE A FAIR TRIAL TO PEACEFUL METHODS OF ADJUSTING THEIR CONFLICTS OF OPINION AND INTEREST
LJ021-0152 AND TO EXPERIMENT FOR A REASONABLE TIME WITH MEASURES SUITABLE TO CIVILIZE OUR INDUSTRIAL CIVILIZATION
LJ021-0153 CLOSELY ALLIED TO THE N.R.A
LJ021-0154 IS THE PROGRAM OF PUBLIC WORKS PROVIDED FOR IN THE SAME ACT AND DESIGNED TO PUT MORE MEN BACK TO WORK
LJ021-0155 BOTH DIRECTLY ON THE PUBLIC WORKS THEMSELVES AND INDIRECTLY IN THE INDUSTRIES SUPPLYING THE MATERIALS FOR THESE PUBLIC WORKS
LJ021-0156 TO THOSE WHO SAY THAT OUR EXPENDITURES FOR PUBLIC WORKS AND OTHER MEANS FOR RECOVERY ARE A WASTE THAT WE CANNOT AFFORD
LJ021-0157 I ANSWER THAT NO COUNTRY HOWEVER RICH CAN AFFORD THE WASTE OF ITS HUMAN RESOURCES
LJ021-0158 DEMORALIZATION CAUSED BY VAST UNEMPLOYMENT IS OUR GREATEST EXTRAVAGANCE
LJ021-0159 MORALLY IT IS THE GREATEST MENACE TO OUR SOCIAL ORDER
LJ021-0160 SOME PEOPLE TRY TO TELL ME THAT WE MUST MAKE UP OUR MINDS THAT FOR THE FUTURE WE SHALL PERMANENTLY HAVE MILLIONS OF UNEMPLOYED
LJ021-0161 JUST AS OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE HAD THEM FOR OVER A DECADE
LJ021-0162 WHAT MAY BE NECESSARY FOR THOSE COUNTRIES IS NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY TO DETERMINE
LJ021-0163 BUT AS FOR THIS COUNTRY I STAND OR FALL BY MY REFUSAL TO ACCEPT AS A NECESSARY CONDITION OF OUR FUTURE
LJ021-0164 A PERMANENT ARMY OF UNEMPLOYED
LJ021-0165 ON THE CONTRARY
LJ021-0166 WE MUST MAKE IT A NATIONAL PRINCIPLE THAT WE WILL NOT TOLERATE A LARGE ARMY OF UNEMPLOYED AND THAT WE WILL ARRANGE OUR NATIONAL ECONOMY
LJ021-0167 TO END OUR PRESENT UNEMPLOYMENT AS SOON AS WE CAN AND THEN TO TAKE WISE MEASURES AGAINST ITS RETURN
LJ021-0168 I DO NOT WANT TO THINK THAT IT IS THE DESTINY OF ANY AMERICAN TO REMAIN PERMANENTLY ON RELIEF ROLLS
LJ021-0169 THOSE FORTUNATELY FEW IN NUMBER WHO ARE FRIGHTENED BY BOLDNESS AND COWED BY THE NECESSITY FOR MAKING DECISIONS
LJ021-0170 COMPLAIN THAT ALL WE HAVE DONE IS UNNECESSARY AND SUBJECT TO GREAT RISKS
LJ021-0171 NOW THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE COMING OUT OF THEIR STORM CELLARS THEY FORGET THAT THERE EVER WAS A STORM
LJ021-0172 THEY POINT TO ENGLAND
LJ021-0173 THEY WOULD HAVE YOU BELIEVE THAT ENGLAND HAS MADE PROGRESS OUT OF HER DEPRESSION BY A DONOTHING POLICY BY LETTING NATURE TAKE HER COURSE
LJ021-0174 ENGLAND HAS HER PECULIARITIES AND WE HAVE OURS
LJ021-0175 BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE ANY INTELLIGENT OBSERVER CAN ACCUSE ENGLAND OF UNDUE ORTHODOXY IN THE PRESENT EMERGENCY
LJ021-0176 DID ENGLAND LET NATURE TAKE HER COURSE NO
LJ021-0177 DID ENGLAND HOLD TO THE GOLD STANDARD WHEN HER RESERVES WERE THREATENED
LJ021-0178 HAS ENGLAND GONE BACK TO THE GOLD STANDARD TODAY
LJ021-0179 DID ENGLAND HESITATE TO CALL IN TEN BILLION DOLLARS OF HER WAR BONDS BEARING 5 PERCENT INTEREST
LJ021-0180 TO ISSUE NEW BONDS THEREFORE BEARING ONLY 3 AND ONE HALF PERCENT INTEREST
LJ021-0181 THEREBY SAVING THE BRITISH TREASURY ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN INTEREST ALONE
LJ021-0182 AND LET IT BE RECORDED THAT THE BRITISH BANKERS HELPED
LJ021-0183 IS IT NOT A FACT THAT EVER SINCE THE YEAR 1909
LJ021-0184 GREAT BRITAIN IN MANY WAYS HAS ADVANCED FURTHER ALONG LINES OF SOCIAL SECURITY THAN THE UNITED STATES
LJ021-0185 IS IT NOT A FACT THAT RELATIONS BETWEEN CAPITAL AND LABOR ON THE BASIS OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ARE MUCH FURTHER ADVANCED IN GREAT BRITAIN
LJ021-0186 THAN IN THE UNITED STATES
LJ021-0187 IT IS PERHAPS NOT STRANGE THAT THE CONSERVATIVE BRITISH PRESS HAS TOLD US WITH PARDONABLE IRONY
LJ021-0188 THAT MUCH OF OUR NEW DEAL PROGRAM IS ONLY AN ATTEMPT TO CATCH UP WITH ENGLISH REFORMS THAT GO BACK TEN YEARS OR MORE
LJ021-0189 NEARLY ALL AMERICANS ARE SENSIBLE AND CALM PEOPLE
LJ021-0190 WE DO NOT GET GREATLY EXCITED NOR IS OUR PEACE OF MIND DISTURBED WHETHER WE BE BUSINESSMEN OR WORKERS OR FARMERS
LJ021-0191 BY AWESOME PRONOUNCEMENTS CONCERNING THE UNCONSTITUTIONALITY OF SOME OF OUR MEASURES OF RECOVERY AND RELIEF AND REFORM
LJ021-0192 WE ARE NOT FRIGHTENED BY REACTIONARY LAWYERS OR POLITICAL EDITORS
LJ021-0193 ALL OF THESE CRIES HAVE BEEN HEARD BEFORE
LJ021-0194 MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS AGO WHEN THEODORE ROOSEVELT AND WOODROW WILSON WERE ATTEMPTING TO CORRECT ABUSES IN OUR NATIONAL LIFE
LJ021-0195 THE GREAT CHIEF JUSTICE WHITE SAID
LJ021-0196 THERE IS GREAT DANGER IT SEEMS TO ME TO ARISE FROM THE CONSTANT HABIT WHICH PREVAILS WHERE ANYTHING IS OPPOSED OR OBJECTED TO
LJ021-0197 OF REFERRING WITHOUT RHYME OR REASON TO THE CONSTITUTION AS A MEANS OF PREVENTING ITS ACCOMPLISHMENT THUS CREATING THE GENERAL IMPRESSION
LJ021-0198 THAT THE CONSTITUTION IS BUT A BARRIER TO PROGRESS INSTEAD OF BEING THE BROAD HIGHWAY THROUGH WHICH ALONE TRUE PROGRESS MAY BE ENJOYED
LJ021-0199 IN OUR EFFORTS FOR RECOVERY
LJ021-0200 WE HAVE AVOIDED ON THE ONE HAND THE THEORY THAT BUSINESS SHOULD AND MUST BE TAKEN OVER INTO AN ALLEMBRACING GOVERNMENT
LJ021-0201 WE HAVE AVOIDED ON THE OTHER HAND
LJ021-0202 THE EQUALLY UNTENABLE THEORY THAT IT IS AN INTERFERENCE WITH LIBERTY TO OFFER REASONABLE HELP WHEN PRIVATE ENTERPRISE IS IN NEED OF HELP
LJ021-0203 THE COURSE WE HAVE FOLLOWED FITS THE AMERICAN PRACTICE OF GOVERNMENT  A PRACTICE OF TAKING ACTION STEP BY STEP
LJ021-0204 OF REGULATING ONLY TO MEET CONCRETE NEEDS  A PRACTICE OF COURAGEOUS RECOGNITION OF CHANGE
LJ021-0205 I BELIEVE WITH ABRAHAM LINCOLN THAT THE LEGITIMATE OBJECT OF GOVERNMENT IS TO DO FOR A COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE
LJ021-0206 WHATEVER THEY NEED TO HAVE DONE BUT CANNOT DO AT ALL OR CANNOT DO SO WELL FOR THEMSELVES IN THEIR SEPARATE AND INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES
LJ021-0207 I AM NOT FOR A RETURN TO THAT DEFINITION OF LIBERTY UNDER WHICH FOR MANY YEARS A FREE PEOPLE WERE BEING GRADUALLY REGIMENTED
LJ021-0208 INTO THE SERVICE OF THE PRIVILEGED FEW
LJ021-0209 I PREFER AND I AM SURE YOU PREFER THAT BROADER DEFINITION OF LIBERTY UNDER WHICH WE ARE MOVING FORWARD TO GREATER FREEDOM
LJ021-0210 TO GREATER SECURITY FOR THE AVERAGE MAN THAN HE HAS EVER KNOWN BEFORE IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICA
LJ022-0001 THE FIRESIDE CHATS OF FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT BY FRANKLIN D ROOSEVELT SECTION 7
LJ022-0002 APRIL 28 1935
LJ022-0003 SINCE MY ANNUAL MESSAGE TO THE CONGRESS ON JANUARY FOURTH LAST I HAVE NOT ADDRESSED THE GENERAL PUBLIC OVER THE AIR
LJ022-0004 IN THE MANY WEEKS SINCE THAT TIME THE CONGRESS HAS DEVOTED ITSELF TO THE ARDUOUS TASK OF FORMULATING LEGISLATION NECESSARY TO THE COUNTRY'S WELFARE
LJ022-0005 IT HAS MADE AND IS MAKING DISTINCT PROGRESS
LJ022-0006 BEFORE I COME TO ANY OF THE SPECIFIC MEASURES HOWEVER I WANT TO LEAVE IN YOUR MINDS ONE CLEAR FACT
LJ022-0007 THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE CONGRESS ARE NOT PROCEEDING IN ANY HAPHAZARD FASHION IN THIS TASK OF GOVERNMENT
LJ022-0008 EACH OF OUR STEPS HAS A DEFINITE RELATIONSHIP TO EVERY OTHER STEP
LJ022-0009 THE JOB OF CREATING A PROGRAM FOR THE NATION'S WELFARE IS IN SOME RESPECTS LIKE THE BUILDING OF A SHIP
LJ022-0010 AT DIFFERENT POINTS ON THE COAST WHERE I OFTEN VISIT THEY BUILD GREAT SEAGOING SHIPS
LJ022-0011 WHEN ONE OF THESE SHIPS IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND THE STEEL FRAMES HAVE BEEN SET IN THE KEEL
LJ022-0012 IT IS DIFFICULT FOR A PERSON WHO DOES NOT KNOW SHIPS TO TELL HOW IT WILL FINALLY LOOK WHEN IT IS SAILING THE HIGH SEAS
LJ022-0013 IT MAY SEEM CONFUSED TO SOME BUT OUT OF THE MULTITUDE OF DETAILED PARTS THAT GO INTO THE MAKING OF THE STRUCTURE
LJ022-0014 THE CREATION OF A USEFUL INSTRUMENT FOR MAN ULTIMATELY COMES
LJ022-0015 IT IS THAT WAY WITH THE MAKING OF A NATIONAL POLICY. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE NATION HAS GREATLY CHANGED IN THREE YEARS
LJ022-0016 BEFORE THAT TIME INDIVIDUAL SELF INTEREST AND GROUP SELFISHNESS WERE PARAMOUNT IN PUBLIC THINKING
LJ022-0017 THE GENERAL GOOD WAS AT A DISCOUNT
LJ022-0018 THREE YEARS OF HARD THINKING HAVE CHANGED THE PICTURE
LJ022-0019 MORE AND MORE PEOPLE
LJ022-0020 CAUSE OF CLEARER THINKING AND A BETTER UNDERSTANDING ARE CONSIDERING THE WHOLE RATHER THAN A MERE PART RELATING TO ONE SECTION OR TO ONE CROP
LJ022-0021 OR TO ONE INDUSTRY OR TO AN INDIVIDUAL PRIVATE OCCUPATION
LJ022-0022 THAT IS A TREMENDOUS GAIN FOR THE PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY
LJ022-0023 THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY KNOW HOW TO SIFT THE WHEAT FROM THE CHAFF IN WHAT THEY HEAR AND WHAT THEY READ
LJ022-0024 THEY KNOW THAT THE PROCESS OF THE CONSTRUCTIVE REBUILDING OF AMERICA CANNOT BE DONE IN A DAY OR A YEAR
LJ022-0025 BUT THAT IT IS BEING DONE IN SPITE OF THE FEW WHO SEEK TO CONFUSE THEM AND TO PROFIT BY THEIR CONFUSION
LJ022-0026 AMERICANS AS A WHOLE ARE FEELING A LOT BETTER  A LOT MORE CHEERFUL THAN FOR MANY MANY YEARS
LJ022-0027 THE MOST DIFFICULT PLACE IN THE WORLD TO GET A CLEAR OPEN PERSPECTIVE OF THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE IS WASHINGTON
LJ022-0028 I AM REMINDED SOMETIMES OF WHAT PRESIDENT WILSON ONCE SAID
LJ022-0029 SO MANY PEOPLE COME TO WASHINGTON WHO KNOW THINGS THAT ARE NOT SO
LJ022-0030 AND SO FEW PEOPLE WHO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES ARE THINKING ABOUT
LJ022-0031 THAT IS WHY I OCCASIONALLY LEAVE THIS SCENE OF ACTION FOR A FEW DAYS
LJ022-0032 TO GO FISHING OR BACK HOME TO HYDE PARK SO THAT I CAN HAVE A CHANCE TO THINK QUIETLY ABOUT THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE
LJ022-0033 TO GET AWAY FROM THE TREES AS THEY SAY AND TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE FOREST
LJ022-0034 THIS DUTY OF SEEING THE COUNTRY IN A LONGRANGE PERSPECTIVE
LJ022-0035 IS ONE WHICH IN A VERY SPECIAL MANNER ATTACHES TO THIS OFFICE TO WHICH YOU HAVE CHOSEN ME
LJ022-0036 DID YOU EVER STOP TO THINK THAT THERE ARE AFTER ALL ONLY TWO POSITIONS IN THE NATION
LJ022-0037 THAT ARE FILLED BY THE VOTE OF ALL OF THE VOTERS  THE PRESIDENT AND THE VICEPRESIDENT
LJ022-0038 THAT MAKES IT PARTICULARLY NECESSARY FOR THE VICE PRESIDENT AND FOR ME TO CONCEIVE OF OUR DUTY TOWARD THE ENTIRE COUNTRY
LJ022-0039 I SPEAK THEREFORE TONIGHT TO AND OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AS A WHOLE
LJ022-0040 MY MOST IMMEDIATE CONCERN IS IN CARRYING OUT THE PURPOSES OF THE GREAT WORK PROGRAM JUST ENACTED BY THE CONGRESS
LJ022-0041 ITS FIRST OBJECTIVE IS TO PUT MEN AND WOMEN NOW ON THE RELIEF ROLLS TO WORK AND INCIDENTALLY
LJ022-0042 TO ASSIST MATERIALLY IN OUR ALREADY UNMISTAKABLE MARCH TOWARD RECOVERY
LJ022-0043 I SHALL NOT CONFUSE MY DISCUSSION BY A MULTITUDE OF FIGURES. SO MANY FIGURES ARE QUOTED TO PROVE SO MANY THINGS
LJ022-0044 SOMETIMES IT DEPENDS UPON WHAT PAPER YOU READ AND WHAT BROADCAST YOU HEAR
LJ022-0045 THEREFORE LET US KEEP OUR MINDS ON TWO OR THREE SIMPLE ESSENTIAL FACTS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS PROBLEM OF UNEMPLOYMENT
LJ022-0046 IT IS TRUE THAT WHILE BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY ARE DEFINITELY BETTER OUR RELIEF ROLLS ARE STILL TOO LARGE
LJ022-0047 HOWEVER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FIVE YEARS THE RELIEF ROLLS HAVE DECLINED INSTEAD OF INCREASED DURING THE WINTER MONTHS
LJ022-0048 THEY ARE STILL DECLINING
LJ022-0049 THE SIMPLE FACT IS THAT MANY MILLION MORE PEOPLE HAVE PRIVATE WORK TODAY THAN TWO YEARS AGO TODAY OR ONE YEAR AGO TODAY
LJ022-0050 AND EVERY DAY THAT PASSES OFFERS MORE CHANCES TO WORK FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO WORK
LJ022-0051 IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT UNEMPLOYMENT REMAINS A SERIOUS PROBLEM
LJ022-0052 HERE AS IN EVERY OTHER NATION WE HAVE COME TO RECOGNIZE THE POSSIBILITY AND THE NECESSITY OF CERTAIN HELPFUL REMEDIAL MEASURES
LJ022-0053 THESE MEASURES ARE OF TWO KINDS
LJ022-0054 THE FIRST IS TO MAKE PROVISIONS INTENDED TO RELIEVE TO MINIMIZE AND TO PREVENT FUTURE UNEMPLOYMENT
LJ022-0055 THE SECOND IS TO ESTABLISH THE PRACTICAL MEANS TO HELP THOSE WHO ARE UNEMPLOYED IN THIS PRESENT EMERGENCY
LJ022-0056 OUR SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION IS AN ATTEMPT TO ANSWER THE FIRST OF THESE QUESTIONS OUR WORKS RELIEF PROGRAM THE SECOND
LJ022-0057 THE PROGRAM FOR SOCIAL SECURITY NOW PENDING BEFORE THE CONGRESS IS A NECESSARY PART OF THE FUTURE UNEMPLOYMENT POLICY OF THE GOVERNMENT
LJ022-0058 WHILE OUR PRESENT AND PROJECTED EXPENDITURES FOR WORK RELIEF ARE WHOLLY WITHIN THE REASONABLE LIMITS OF OUR NATIONAL CREDIT RESOURCES
LJ022-0059 IT IS OBVIOUS THAT WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO CREATE GOVERNMENTAL DEFICITS FOR THAT PURPOSE YEAR AFTER YEAR
LJ022-0060 WE MUST BEGIN NOW TO MAKE PROVISION FOR THE FUTURE
LJ022-0061 THAT IS WHY OUR SOCIAL SECURITY PROGRAM IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE COMPLETE PICTURE
LJ022-0062 IT PROPOSES BY MEANS OF OLD AGE PENSIONS
LJ022-0063 TO HELP THOSE WHO HAVE REACHED THE AGE OF RETIREMENT TO GIVE UP THEIR JOBS AND THUS GIVE TO THE YOUNGER GENERATION GREATER OPPORTUNITIES FOR WORK
LJ022-0064 AND TO GIVE TO ALL A FEELING OF SECURITY AS THEY LOOK TOWARD OLD AGE
LJ022-0065 THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PART OF THE LEGISLATION
LJ022-0066 WILL NOT ONLY HELP TO GUARD THE INDIVIDUAL IN FUTURE PERIODS OF LAYOFF AGAINST DEPENDENCE UPON RELIEF
LJ022-0067 BUT IT WILL BY SUSTAINING PURCHASING POWER CUSHION THE SHOCK OF ECONOMIC DISTRESS
LJ022-0068 ANOTHER HELPFUL FEATURE OF UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE IS THE INCENTIVE IT WILL GIVE TO EMPLOYERS TO PLAN MORE CAREFULLY
LJ022-0069 IN ORDER THAT UNEMPLOYMENT MAY BE PREVENTED BY THE STABILIZING OF EMPLOYMENT ITSELF
LJ022-0070 PROVISIONS FOR SOCIAL SECURITY HOWEVER ARE PROTECTIONS FOR THE FUTURE
LJ022-0071 OUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE IMMEDIATE NECESSITIES OF THE UNEMPLOYED HAS BEEN MET BY THE CONGRESS
LJ022-0072 THROUGH THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE WORK PLAN IN THE HISTORY OF THE NATION
LJ022-0073 OUR PROBLEM IS TO PUT TO WORK THREE AND ONEHALF MILLION EMPLOYABLE PERSONS NOW ON THE RELIEF ROLLS
LJ022-0074 IT IS A PROBLEM QUITE AS MUCH FOR PRIVATE INDUSTRY AS FOR THE GOVERNMENT
LJ022-0075 WE ARE LOSING NO TIME GETTING THE GOVERNMENT'S VAST WORK RELIEF PROGRAM UNDERWAY
LJ022-0076 AND WE HAVE EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT IT SHOULD BE IN FULL SWING BY AUTUMN
LJ022-0077 IN DIRECTING IT I SHALL RECOGNIZE SIX FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES
LJ022-0078 ONE THE PROJECTS SHOULD BE USEFUL
LJ022-0079 PROJECTS SHALL BE OF A NATURE THAT A CONSIDERABLE PROPORTION OF THE MONEY SPENT WILL GO INTO WAGES FOR LABOR
LJ022-0080 PROJECTS WILL BE SOUGHT WHICH PROMISE ULTIMATE RETURN TO THE FEDERAL TREASURY OF A CONSIDERABLE PROPORTION OF THE COSTS
LJ022-0081 FUNDS ALLOTTED FOR EACH PROJECT SHOULD BE ACTUALLY AND PROMPTLY SPENT AND NOT HELD OVER UNTIL LATER YEARS
LJ022-0082 IN ALL CASES PROJECTS MUST BE OF A CHARACTER TO GIVE EMPLOYMENT TO THOSE ON THE RELIEF ROLLS
LJ022-0083 SIX PROJECTS WILL BE ALLOCATED TO LOCALITIES OR RELIEF AREAS IN RELATION TO THE NUMBER OF WORKERS ON RELIEF ROLLS IN THOSE AREAS
LJ022-0084 I NEXT WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR EXACTLY HOW WE SHALL DIRECT THE WORK
LJ022-0085 I HAVE SET UP A DIVISION OF APPLICATIONS AND INFORMATION
LJ022-0086 TO WHICH ALL PROPOSALS FOR THE EXPENDITURE OF MONEY MUST GO FOR PRELIMINARY STUDY AND CONSIDERATION
LJ022-0087 AFTER THE DIVISION OF APPLICATIONS AND INFORMATION HAS SIFTED THOSE PROJECTS
LJ022-0088 THEY WILL BE SENT TO AN ALLOTMENT DIVISION COMPOSED OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MORE IMPORTANT GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES
LJ022-0089 CHARGED WITH CARRYING ON WORK RELIEF PROJECTS
LJ022-0090 THE GROUP WILL ALSO INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES OF CITIES AND OF LABOR FARMING BANKING AND INDUSTRY
LJ022-0091 THIS ALLOTMENT DIVISION WILL CONSIDER ALL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS SUBMITTED TO IT
LJ022-0092 AND SUCH PROJECTS AS THEY APPROVE WILL BE NEXT SUBMITTED TO THE PRESIDENT WHO UNDER THE ACT IS REQUIRED TO MAKE FINAL ALLOCATIONS
LJ022-0093 THE NEXT STEP WILL BE TO NOTIFY THE PROPER GOVERNMENT AGENCY
LJ022-0094 IN WHOSE FIELD THE PROJECT FALLS AND ALSO TO NOTIFY ANOTHER AGENCY WHICH I AM CREATING  A PROGRESS DIVISION
LJ022-0095 THIS DIVISION WILL HAVE THE DUTY OF COORDINATING THE PURCHASES OF MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES
LJ022-0096 AND OF MAKING CERTAIN THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE EMPLOYED WILL BE TAKEN FROM THE RELIEF ROLLS
LJ022-0097 IT WILL ALSO HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF DETERMINING WORK PAYMENTS IN VARIOUS LOCALITIES
LJ022-0098 OF MAKING FULL USE OF EXISTING EMPLOYMENT SERVICES AND TO ASSIST PEOPLE ENGAGED IN RELIEF WORK
LJ022-0099 TO MOVE AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE BACK INTO PRIVATE EMPLOYMENT WHEN SUCH EMPLOYMENT IS AVAILABLE
LJ022-0100 MOREOVER THIS DIVISION WILL BE CHARGED WITH KEEPING PROJECTS MOVING ON SCHEDULE
LJ022-0101 I HAVE FELT IT TO BE ESSENTIALLY WISE AND PRUDENT TO AVOID SO FAR AS POSSIBLE
LJ022-0102 THE CREATION OF NEW GOVERNMENTAL MACHINERY FOR SUPERVISING THIS WORK
LJ022-0103 THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT NOW HAS AT LEAST SIXTY DIFFERENT AGENCIES WITH THE STAFF
LJ022-0104 AND THE EXPERIENCE AND THE COMPETENCE NECESSARY TO CARRY ON THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY OR THREE HUNDRED KINDS OF WORK THAT WILL BE UNDERTAKEN
LJ022-0105 THESE AGENCIES THEREFORE WILL SIMPLY BE DOING ON A SOMEWHAT ENLARGED SCALE THE SAME SORT OF THINGS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN DOING
LJ022-0106 THIS WILL MAKE CERTAIN THAT THE LARGEST POSSIBLE PORTION OF THE FUNDS ALLOTTED
LJ022-0107 WILL BE SPENT FOR ACTUALLY CREATING NEW WORK AND NOT FOR BUILDING UP EXPENSIVE OVERHEAD ORGANIZATIONS HERE IN WASHINGTON
LJ022-0108 FOR MANY MONTHS PREPARATIONS HAVE BEEN UNDER WAY
LJ022-0109 THE ALLOTMENT OF FUNDS FOR DESIRABLE PROJECTS HAS ALREADY BEGUN
LJ022-0110 THE KEY MEN FOR THE MAJOR RESPONSIBILITIES OF THIS GREAT TASK ALREADY HAVE BEEN SELECTED
LJ022-0111 I WELL REALIZE THAT THE COUNTRY IS EXPECTING BEFORE THIS YEAR IS OUT TO SEE THE DIRT FLY AS THEY SAY IN CARRYING ON THE WORK
LJ022-0112 AND I ASSURE MY FELLOW CITIZENS THAT NO ENERGY WILL BE SPARED IN USING THESE FUNDS EFFECTIVELY
LJ022-0113 TO MAKE A MAJOR ATTACK UPON THE PROBLEM OF UNEMPLOYMENT
LJ022-0114 OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO ALL OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY
LJ022-0115 THIS IS A GREAT NATIONAL CRUSADE TO DESTROY ENFORCED IDLENESS WHICH IS AN ENEMY OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT
LJ022-0116 GENERATED BY THIS DEPRESSION
LJ022-0117 OUR ATTACK UPON THESE ENEMIES MUST BE WITHOUT STINT AND WITHOUT DISCRIMINATION
LJ022-0118 NO SECTIONAL NO POLITICAL DISTINCTIONS CAN BE PERMITTED
LJ022-0119 IT MUST HOWEVER BE RECOGNIZED THAT WHEN AN ENTERPRISE OF THIS CHARACTER IS EXTENDED OVER MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE NATION
LJ022-0120 THERE MAY BE OCCASIONAL INSTANCES OF INEFFICIENCY BAD MANAGEMENT OR MISUSE OF FUNDS
LJ022-0121 WHEN CASES OF THIS KIND OCCUR
LJ022-0122 THERE WILL BE THOSE OF COURSE WHO WILL TRY TO TELL YOU THAT THE EXCEPTIONAL FAILURE IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE ENTIRE ENDEAVOR
LJ022-0123 IT SHOULD BE REMEMBERED THAT IN EVERY BIG JOB THERE ARE SOME IMPERFECTIONS
LJ022-0124 THERE ARE CHISELERS IN EVERY WALK OF LIFE THERE ARE THOSE IN EVERY INDUSTRY WHO ARE GUILTY OF UNFAIR PRACTICES
LJ022-0125 EVERY PROFESSION HAS ITS BLACK SHEEP BUT LONG EXPERIENCE IN GOVERNMENT HAS TAUGHT ME
LJ022-0126 THAT THE EXCEPTIONAL INSTANCES OF WRONGDOING IN GOVERNMENT ARE PROBABLY LESS NUMEROUS THAN IN ALMOST EVERY OTHER LINE OF ENDEAVOR
LJ022-0127 THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS OF PREVENTING SUCH EVILS IN THIS WORKS RELIEF PROGRAM WILL BE THE ETERNAL VIGILANCE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THEMSELVES
LJ022-0128 I CALL UPON MY FELLOW CITIZENS EVERYWHERE TO COOPERATE WITH ME
LJ022-0129 IN MAKING THIS THE MOST EFFICIENT AND THE CLEANEST EXAMPLE OF PUBLIC ENTERPRISE THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN
LJ022-0130 IT IS TIME TO PROVIDE A SMASHING ANSWER FOR THOSE CYNICAL MEN WHO SAY THAT A DEMOCRACY CANNOT BE HONEST AND EFFICIENT
LJ022-0131 IF YOU WILL HELP THIS CAN BE DONE
LJ022-0132 I THEREFORE HOPE YOU WILL WATCH THE WORK IN EVERY CORNER OF THIS NATION
LJ022-0133 FEEL FREE TO CRITICIZE. TELL ME OF INSTANCES WHERE WORK CAN BE DONE BETTER OR WHERE IMPROPER PRACTICES PREVAIL
LJ022-0134 NEITHER YOU NOR I WANT CRITICISM CONCEIVED IN A PURELY FAULTFINDING OR PARTISAN SPIRIT
LJ022-0135 BUT I AM JEALOUS OF THE RIGHT OF EVERY CITIZEN TO CALL TO THE ATTENTION OF HIS OR HER GOVERNMENT
LJ022-0136 EXAMPLES OF HOW THE PUBLIC MONEY CAN BE MORE EFFECTIVELY SPENT FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
LJ022-0137 I NOW COME MY FRIENDS TO A PART OF THE REMAINING BUSINESS BEFORE THE CONGRESS
LJ022-0138 IT HAS UNDER CONSIDERATION MANY MEASURES WHICH PROVIDE FOR THE ROUNDING OUT OF THE PROGRAM OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RECONSTRUCTION
LJ022-0139 WITH WHICH WE HAVE BEEN CONCERNED FOR TWO YEARS
LJ022-0140 I CAN MENTION ONLY A FEW OF THEM TONIGHT BUT I DO NOT WANT MY MENTION OF SPECIFIC MEASURES
LJ022-0141 TO BE INTERPRETED AS LACK OF INTEREST IN OR DISAPPROVAL OF MANY OTHER IMPORTANT PROPOSALS THAT ARE PENDING
LJ022-0142 THE NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL RECOVERY ACT EXPIRES ON THE SIXTEENTH OF JUNE
LJ022-0143 AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION I HAVE ASKED THE CONGRESS TO EXTEND THE LIFE OF THIS USEFUL AGENCY OF GOVERNMENT
LJ022-0144 AS WE HAVE PROCEEDED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF THIS ACT
LJ022-0145 WE HAVE FOUND FROM TIME TO TIME MORE AND MORE USEFUL WAYS OF PROMOTING ITS PURPOSES
LJ022-0146 NO REASONABLE PERSON WANTS TO ABANDON OUR PRESENT GAINS
LJ022-0147 WE MUST CONTINUE TO PROTECT CHILDREN
LJ022-0148 TO ENFORCE MINIMUM WAGES TO PREVENT EXCESSIVE HOURS
LJ022-0149 TO SAFEGUARD DEFINE AND ENFORCE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND WHILE RETAINING FAIR COMPETITION
LJ022-0150 TO ELIMINATE SO FAR AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE THE KINDS OF UNFAIR PRACTICES BY SELFISH MINORITIES WHICH UNFORTUNATELY
LJ022-0151 DID MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE TO BRING ABOUT THE RECENT COLLAPSE OF INDUSTRIES
LJ022-0152 THERE IS LIKEWISE PENDING BEFORE THE CONGRESS
LJ022-0153 LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE FOR THE ELIMINATION OF UNNECESSARY HOLDING COMPANIES IN THE PUBLIC UTILITY FIELD
LJ022-0154 I CONSIDER THIS LEGISLATION A POSITIVE RECOVERY MEASURE
LJ022-0155 POWER PRODUCTION IN THIS COUNTRY IS VIRTUALLY BACK TO THE NINETEEN TWENTY NINE PEAK
LJ022-0156 THE OPERATING COMPANIES IN THE GAS AND ELECTRIC UTILITY FIELD ARE BY AND LARGE IN GOOD CONDITION BUT
LJ022-0157 UNDER HOLDING COMPANY DOMINATION THE UTILITY INDUSTRY HAS LONG BEEN HOPELESSLY AT WAR WITHIN ITSELF AND WITH PUBLIC SENTIMENT
LJ022-0158 BY FAR THE GREATER PART OF THE GENERAL DECLINE IN UTILITY SECURITIES HAD OCCURRED BEFORE I WAS INAUGURATED
LJ022-0159 THE ABSENTEE MANAGEMENT OF UNNECESSARY HOLDING COMPANY CONTROL
LJ022-0160 HAS LOST TOUCH WITH AND HAS LOST THE SYMPATHY OF THE COMMUNITIES IT PRETENDS TO SERVE
LJ022-0161 EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANTLY IT HAS GIVEN THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE AN UNEASY APPREHENSION OF OVERCONCENTRATED ECONOMIC POWER
LJ022-0162 A BUSINESS THAT LOSES THE CONFIDENCE OF ITS CUSTOMERS AND THE GOODWILL OF THE PUBLIC CANNOT LONG CONTINUE TO BE A GOOD RISK FOR THE INVESTOR
LJ022-0163 THIS LEGISLATION WILL SERVE THE INVESTOR BY ENDING THE CONDITIONS WHICH HAVE CAUSED THAT LACK OF CONFIDENCE AND GOODWILL
LJ022-0164 IT WILL PUT THE PUBLIC UTILITY OPERATING INDUSTRY ON A SOUND BASIS FOR THE FUTURE
LJ022-0165 BOTH IN ITS PUBLIC RELATIONS AND IN ITS INTERNAL RELATIONS
LJ022-0166 THIS LEGISLATION WILL NOT ONLY IN THE LONG RUN RESULT IN PROVIDING LOWER ELECTRIC AND GAS RATES TO THE CONSUMER
LJ022-0167 BUT IT WILL PROTECT THE ACTUAL VALUE AND EARNING POWER OF PROPERTIES NOW OWNED BY THOUSANDS OF INVESTORS
LJ022-0168 WHO HAVE LITTLE PROTECTION UNDER THE OLD LAWS AGAINST WHAT USED TO BE CALLED FRENZIED FINANCE
LJ022-0169 IT WILL NOT DESTROY VALUES
LJ022-0170 NOT ONLY BUSINESS RECOVERY BUT THE GENERAL ECONOMIC RECOVERY OF THE NATION WILL BE GREATLY STIMULATED BY THE ENACTMENT OF LEGISLATION
LJ022-0171 DESIGNED TO IMPROVE THE STATUS OF OUR TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES
LJ022-0172 THERE IS NEED FOR LEGISLATION PROVIDING FOR THE REGULATION OF INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION BY BUSES AND TRUCKS
LJ022-0173 FOR THE REGULATION OF TRANSPORTATION BY WATER FOR THE STRENGTHENING OF OUR MERCHANT MARINE AND AIR TRANSPORT
LJ022-0174 FOR THE STRENGTHENING OF THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION TO ENABLE IT TO CARRY OUT A ROUNDED CONCEPTION OF THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM
LJ022-0175 IN WHICH THE BENEFITS OF PRIVATE OWNERSHIP ARE RETAINED WHILE THE PUBLIC STAKE IN THESE IMPORTANT SERVICES IS PROTECTED BY THE PUBLIC'S GOVERNMENT
LJ022-0176 FINALLY THE REESTABLISHMENT OF PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE BANKS OF THE NATION
LJ022-0177 IS ONE OF THE MOST HOPEFUL RESULTS OF OUR EFFORTS AS A NATION TO REESTABLISH PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN PRIVATE BANKING
LJ022-0178 WE ALL KNOW THAT PRIVATE BANKING ACTUALLY EXISTS BY VIRTUE OF THE PERMISSION OF AND REGULATION BY THE PEOPLE AS A WHOLE
LJ022-0179 SPEAKING THROUGH THEIR GOVERNMENT
LJ022-0180 WISE PUBLIC POLICY HOWEVER REQUIRES NOT ONLY THAT BANKING BE SAFE
LJ022-0181 BUT THAT ITS RESOURCES BE MOST FULLY UTILIZED IN THE ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE COUNTRY
LJ022-0182 TO THIS END IT WAS DECIDED MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS AGO
LJ022-0183 THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD ASSUME THE RESPONSIBILITY OF PROVIDING A MEANS BY WHICH THE CREDIT OF THE NATION MIGHT BE CONTROLLED
LJ022-0184 NOT BY A FEW PRIVATE BANKING INSTITUTIONS BUT BY A BODY WITH PUBLIC PRESTIGE AND AUTHORITY
LJ022-0185 THE ANSWER TO THIS DEMAND WAS THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM
LJ022-0186 TWENTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WITH THIS SYSTEM HAVE JUSTIFIED THE EFFORTS MADE TO CREATE IT
LJ022-0187 BUT THESE TWENTY YEARS HAVE SHOWN BY EXPERIENCE DEFINITE POSSIBILITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT
LJ022-0188 CERTAIN PROPOSALS MADE TO AMEND THE FEDERAL RESERVE ACT DESERVE PROMPT AND FAVORABLE ACTION BY THE CONGRESS
LJ022-0189 THEY ARE A MINIMUM OF WISE READJUSTMENTS OF OUR FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM IN THE LIGHT OF PAST EXPERIENCE AND PRESENT NEEDS
LJ022-0190 THESE MEASURES I HAVE MENTIONED ARE IN LARGE PART THE PROGRAM WHICH UNDER MY CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY I HAVE RECOMMENDED TO THE CONGRESS
LJ022-0191 THEY ARE ESSENTIAL FACTORS IN A ROUNDED PROGRAM FOR NATIONAL RECOVERY
LJ022-0192 THEY CONTEMPLATE THE ENRICHMENT OF OUR NATIONAL LIFE
LJ022-0193 BY A SOUND AND RATIONAL ORDERING OF ITS VARIOUS ELEMENTS AND WISE PROVISIONS FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE WEAK AGAINST THE STRONG
LJ022-0194 NEVER SINCE MY INAUGURATION IN MARCH NINETEEN THIRTY THREE HAVE I FELT SO UNMISTAKABLY THE ATMOSPHERE OF RECOVERY
LJ022-0195 BUT IT IS MORE THAN THE RECOVERY OF THE MATERIAL BASIS OF OUR INDIVIDUAL LIVES
LJ022-0196 IT IS THE RECOVERY OF CONFIDENCE IN OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES AND INSTITUTIONS
LJ022-0197 WE HAVE SURVIVED ALL OF THE ARDUOUS BURDENS AND THE THREATENING DANGERS OF A GREAT ECONOMIC CALAMITY
LJ022-0198 WE HAVE IN THE DARKEST MOMENTS OF OUR NATIONAL TRIALS RETAINED OUR FAITH IN OUR OWN ABILITY TO MASTER OUR DESTINY
LJ022-0199 FEAR IS VANISHING AND CONFIDENCE IS GROWING ON EVERY SIDE
LJ022-0200 RENEWED FAITH IN THE VAST POSSIBILITIES OF HUMAN BEINGS TO IMPROVE THEIR MATERIAL AND SPIRITUAL STATUS
LJ022-0201 THROUGH THE INSTRUMENTALITY OF THE DEMOCRATIC FORM OF GOVERNMENT
LJ022-0202 THAT FAITH IS RECEIVING ITS JUST REWARD
LJ022-0203 FOR THAT WE CAN BE THANKFUL TO THE GOD WHO WATCHES OVER AMERICA
LJ023-0001 THE FIRESIDE CHATS OF FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT BY FRANKLIN D ROOSEVELT SECTION 9
LJ023-0002 MARCH NINE NINETEEN THIRTY NINE PART ONE
LJ023-0003 LAST THURSDAY I DESCRIBED IN DETAIL CERTAIN ECONOMIC PROBLEMS WHICH EVERYONE ADMITS NOW FACE THE NATION
LJ023-0004 FOR THE MANY MESSAGES WHICH HAVE COME TO ME AFTER THAT SPEECH AND WHICH IT IS PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO ANSWER INDIVIDUALLY
LJ023-0005 I TAKE THIS MEANS OF SAYING THANK YOU
LJ023-0006 TONIGHT SITTING AT MY DESK IN THE WHITE HOUSE I MAKE MY FIRST RADIO REPORT TO THE PEOPLE IN MY SECOND TERM OF OFFICE
LJ023-0007 I AM REMINDED OF THAT EVENING IN MARCH FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN I MADE MY FIRST RADIO REPORT TO YOU
LJ023-0008 WE WERE THEN IN THE MIDST OF THE GREAT BANKING CRISIS
LJ023-0009 SOON AFTER WITH THE AUTHORITY OF THE CONGRESS
LJ023-0010 WE ASKED THE NATION TO TURN OVER ALL OF ITS PRIVATELY HELD GOLD DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES
LJ023-0011 TODAY'S RECOVERY PROVES HOW RIGHT THAT POLICY WAS
LJ023-0012 BUT WHEN ALMOST TWO YEARS LATER IT CAME BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT ITS CONSTITUTIONALITY WAS UPHELD ONLY BY A FIVETOFOUR VOTE
LJ023-0013 THE CHANGE OF ONE VOTE WOULD HAVE THROWN ALL THE AFFAIRS OF THIS GREAT NATION BACK INTO HOPELESS CHAOS
LJ023-0014 IN EFFECT FOUR JUSTICES RULED THAT THE RIGHT UNDER A PRIVATE CONTRACT
LJ023-0015 TO EXACT A POUND OF FLESH WAS MORE SACRED THAN THE MAIN OBJECTIVES OF THE CONSTITUTION TO ESTABLISH AN ENDURING NATION
LJ023-0016 IN NINETEEN THIRTY THREE YOU AND I KNEW THAT WE MUST NEVER LET OUR ECONOMIC SYSTEM GET COMPLETELY OUT OF JOINT AGAIN
LJ023-0017 THAT WE COULD NOT AFFORD TO TAKE THE RISK OF ANOTHER GREAT DEPRESSION
LJ023-0018 WE ALSO BECAME CONVINCED THAT THE ONLY WAY TO AVOID A REPETITION OF THOSE DARK DAYS WAS TO HAVE A GOVERNMENT WITH POWER TO PREVENT
LJ023-0019 AND TO CURE THE ABUSES AND THE INEQUALITIES WHICH HAD THROWN THAT SYSTEM OUT OF JOINT
LJ023-0020 WE THEN BEGAN A PROGRAM OF REMEDYING THOSE ABUSES AND INEQUALITIES  TO GIVE BALANCE AND STABILITY TO OUR ECONOMIC SYSTEM
LJ023-0021 TO MAKE IT BOMBPROOF AGAINST THE CAUSES OF NINETEEN TWENTY NINE
LJ023-0022 TODAY WE ARE ONLY PARTWAY THROUGH THAT PROGRAM
LJ023-0023 AND RECOVERY IS SPEEDING UP TO A POINT WHERE THE DANGERS OF NINETEEN TWENTY NINE ARE AGAIN BECOMING POSSIBLE
LJ023-0024 NOT THIS WEEK OR MONTH PERHAPS BUT WITHIN A YEAR OR TWO
LJ023-0025 NATIONAL LAWS ARE NEEDED TO COMPLETE THAT PROGRAM
LJ023-0026 INDIVIDUAL OR LOCAL OR STATE EFFORT ALONE CANNOT PROTECT US IN NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN ANY BETTER THAN TEN YEARS AGO
LJ023-0027 IT WILL TAKE TIME  AND PLENTY OF TIME  TO WORK OUT OUR REMEDIES ADMINISTRATIVELY EVEN AFTER LEGISLATION IS PASSED
LJ023-0028 TO COMPLETE OUR PROGRAM OF PROTECTION IN TIME THEREFORE
LJ023-0029 WE CANNOT DELAY ONE MOMENT IN MAKING CERTAIN THAT OUR NATIONAL GOVERNMENT HAS POWER TO CARRY THROUGH
LJ023-0030 FOUR YEARS AGO ACTION DID NOT COME UNTIL THE ELEVENTH HOUR
LJ023-0031 IT WAS ALMOST TOO LATE
LJ023-0032 IF WE LEARNED ANYTHING FROM THE DEPRESSION
LJ023-0033 WE WILL NOT ALLOW OURSELVES TO RUN AROUND IN NEW CIRCLES OF FUTILE DISCUSSION AND DEBATE ALWAYS POSTPONING THE DAY OF DECISION
LJ023-0034 THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE LEARNED FROM THE DEPRESSION
LJ023-0035 FOR IN THE LAST THREE NATIONAL ELECTIONS
LJ023-0036 AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THEM VOTED A MANDATE THAT THE CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT BEGIN THE TASK OF PROVIDING THAT PROTECTION
LJ023-0037 NOT AFTER LONG YEARS OF DEBATE BUT NOW
LJ023-0038 THE COURTS HOWEVER HAVE CAST DOUBTS ON THE ABILITY OF THE ELECTED CONGRESS TO PROTECT US AGAINST CATASTROPHE
LJ023-0039 BY MEETING SQUARELY OUR MODERN SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS
LJ023-0040 WE ARE AT A CRISIS IN OUR ABILITY TO PROCEED WITH THAT PROTECTION
LJ023-0041 IT IS A QUIET CRISIS. THERE ARE NO LINES OF DEPOSITORS OUTSIDE CLOSED BANKS
LJ023-0042 BUT TO THE FARSIGHTED IT IS FARREACHING IN ITS POSSIBILITIES OF INJURY TO AMERICA
LJ023-0043 I WANT TO TALK WITH YOU VERY SIMPLY ABOUT THE NEED FOR PRESENT ACTION IN THIS CRISIS
LJ023-0044 THE NEED TO MEET THE UNANSWERED CHALLENGE OF ONETHIRD OF A NATION ILLNOURISHED ILLCLAD ILLHOUSED
LJ023-0045 LAST THURSDAY I DESCRIBED THE AMERICAN FORM OF GOVERNMENT AS A THREE HORSE TEAM PROVIDED BY THE CONSTITUTION TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
LJ023-0046 SO THAT THEIR FIELD MIGHT BE PLOWED
LJ023-0047 THE THREE HORSES ARE OF COURSE THE THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT  THE CONGRESS THE EXECUTIVE AND THE COURTS
LJ023-0048 TWO OF THE HORSES ARE PULLING IN UNISON TODAY THE THIRD IS NOT
LJ023-0049 THOSE WHO HAVE INTIMATED THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS TRYING TO DRIVE THAT TEAM
LJ023-0050 OVERLOOK THE SIMPLE FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE IS HIMSELF ONE OF THE THREE HORSES
LJ023-0051 IT IS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THEMSELVES WHO ARE IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT
LJ023-0052 IT IS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THEMSELVES WHO WANT THE FURROW PLOWED
LJ023-0053 IT IS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THEMSELVES WHO EXPECT THE THIRD HORSE TO PULL IN UNISON WITH THE OTHER TWO
LJ023-0054 I HOPE THAT YOU HAVE REREAD THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES IN THESE PAST FEW WEEKS
LJ023-0055 LIKE THE BIBLE IT OUGHT TO BE READ AGAIN AND AGAIN
LJ023-0056 IT IS AN EASY DOCUMENT TO UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU REMEMBER THAT IT WAS CALLED INTO BEING
LJ023-0057 BECAUSE THE ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION UNDER WHICH THE ORIGINAL THIRTEEN STATES TRIED TO OPERATE AFTER THE REVOLUTION
LJ023-0058 SHOWED THE NEED OF A NATIONAL GOVERNMENT WITH POWER ENOUGH TO HANDLE NATIONAL PROBLEMS
LJ023-0059 IN ITS PREAMBLE THE CONSTITUTION STATES THAT IT WAS INTENDED TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION AND PROMOTE THE GENERAL WELFARE
LJ023-0060 AND THE POWERS GIVEN TO THE CONGRESS TO CARRY OUT THOSE PURPOSES CAN BE BEST DESCRIBED BY SAYING
LJ023-0061 THAT THEY WERE ALL THE POWERS NEEDED TO MEET EACH AND EVERY PROBLEM WHICH THEN HAD A NATIONAL CHARACTER
LJ023-0062 AND WHICH COULD NOT BE MET BY MERELY LOCAL ACTION
LJ023-0063 BUT THE FRAMERS WENT FURTHER
LJ023-0064 HAVING IN MIND THAT IN SUCCEEDING GENERATIONS MANY OTHER PROBLEMS THEN UNDREAMED OF WOULD BECOME NATIONAL PROBLEMS
LJ023-0065 THEY GAVE TO THE CONGRESS THE AMPLE BROAD POWERS TO LEVY TAXES
LJ023-0066 AND PROVIDE FOR THE COMMON DEFENSE AND GENERAL WELFARE OF THE UNITED STATES
LJ023-0067 THAT MY FRIENDS IS WHAT I HONESTLY BELIEVE
LJ023-0068 TO HAVE BEEN THE CLEAR AND UNDERLYING PURPOSE OF THE PATRIOTS WHO WROTE A FEDERAL CONSTITUTION TO CREATE A NATIONAL GOVERNMENT
LJ023-0069 WITH NATIONAL POWER INTENDED AS THEY SAID TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION
LJ023-0070 FOR OURSELVES AND OUR POSTERITY
LJ023-0071 FOR NEARLY TWENTY YEARS THERE WAS NO CONFLICT BETWEEN THE CONGRESS AND THE COURT
LJ023-0072 CONGRESS PASSED A STATUTE WHICH IN 1803 THE COURT SAID VIOLATED AN EXPRESS PROVISION OF THE CONSTITUTION
LJ023-0073 THE COURT CLAIMED THE POWER TO DECLARE IT UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND DID SO DECLARE IT
LJ023-0074 BUT A LITTLE LATER THE COURT ITSELF ADMITTED
LJ023-0075 THAT IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY POWER TO EXERCISE AND THROUGH MR. JUSTICE WASHINGTON LAID DOWN THIS LIMITATION UPON IT
LJ023-0076 IT IS BUT A DECENT RESPECT DUE TO THE WISDOM THE INTEGRITY AND THE PATRIOTISM OF THE LEGISLATIVE BODY
LJ023-0077 BY WHICH ANY LAW IS PASSED
LJ023-0078 TO PRESUME IN FAVOR OF ITS VALIDITY UNTIL ITS VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTION IS PROVED BEYOND ALL REASONABLE DOUBT
LJ023-0079 BUT SINCE THE RISE OF THE MODERN MOVEMENT FOR SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC PROGRESS THROUGH LEGISLATION
LJ023-0080 THE COURT HAS MORE AND MORE OFTEN AND MORE AND MORE BOLDLY
LJ023-0081 ASSERTED A POWER TO VETO LAWS PASSED BY THE CONGRESS AND STATE LEGISLATURES IN COMPLETE DISREGARD OF THIS ORIGINAL LIMITATION
LJ023-0082 IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS THE SOUND RULE OF GIVING STATUTES THE BENEFIT OF ALL REASONABLE DOUBT HAS BEEN CAST ASIDE
LJ023-0083 THE COURT HAS BEEN ACTING NOT AS A JUDICIAL BODY BUT AS A POLICYMAKING BODY
LJ023-0084 WHEN THE CONGRESS HAS SOUGHT TO STABILIZE NATIONAL AGRICULTURE TO IMPROVE THE CONDITIONS OF LABOR
LJ023-0085 TO SAFEGUARD BUSINESS AGAINST UNFAIR COMPETITION
LJ023-0086 TO PROTECT OUR NATIONAL RESOURCES AND IN MANY OTHER WAYS TO SERVE OUR CLEARLY NATIONAL NEEDS
LJ023-0087 THE MAJORITY OF THE COURT HAS BEEN ASSUMING THE POWER TO PASS ON THE WISDOM OF THESE ACTS OF THE CONGRESS
LJ023-0088 AND TO APPROVE OR DISAPPROVE THE PUBLIC POLICY WRITTEN INTO THESE LAWS
LJ023-0089 THAT IS NOT ONLY MY ACCUSATION
LJ023-0090 IT IS THE ACCUSATION OF MOST DISTINGUISHED JUSTICES OF THE PRESENT SUPREME COURT
LJ023-0091 I HAVE NOT THE TIME TO QUOTE TO YOU ALL THE LANGUAGE USED BY DISSENTING JUSTICES IN MANY OF THESE CASES
LJ023-0092 BUT IN THE CASE HOLDING THE RAILROAD RETIREMENT ACT UNCONSTITUTIONAL FOR INSTANCE
LJ023-0093 CHIEF JUSTICE HUGHES SAID IN A DISSENTING OPINION THAT THE MAJORITY OPINION WAS A DEPARTURE FROM SOUND PRINCIPLES
LJ023-0094 AND PLACED AN UNWARRANTED LIMITATION UPON THE COMMERCE CLAUSE
LJ023-0095 AND THREE OTHER JUSTICES AGREED WITH HIM
LJ023-0096 IN THE CASE OF HOLDING THE A.A.A. UNCONSTITUTIONAL
LJ023-0097 JUSTICE STONE SAID OF THE MAJORITY OPINION THAT IT WAS A TORTURED CONSTRUCTION OF THE CONSTITUTION
LJ023-0098 AND TWO OTHER JUSTICES AGREED WITH HIM
LJ023-0099 IN THE CASE HOLDING THE NEW YORK MINIMUM WAGE LAW UNCONSTITUTIONAL JUSTICE STONE SAID
LJ023-0100 THAT THE MAJORITY WERE ACTUALLY READING INTO THE CONSTITUTION THEIR OWN PERSONAL ECONOMIC PREDILECTIONS AND THAT
LJ023-0101 IF THE LEGISLATIVE POWER IS NOT LEFT FREE TO CHOOSE THE METHODS OF SOLVING THE PROBLEMS OF POVERTY
LJ023-0102 SUBSISTENCE AND HEALTH OF LARGE NUMBERS IN THE COMMUNITY THEN
LJ023-0103 GOVERNMENT IS TO BE RENDERED IMPOTENT
LJ023-0104 AND TWO OTHER JUSTICES AGREED WITH HIM
LJ023-0105 IN THE FACE OF THESE DISSENTING OPINIONS THERE IS NO BASIS FOR THE CLAIM MADE BY SOME MEMBERS OF THE COURT
LJ023-0106 THAT SOMETHING IN THE CONSTITUTION HAS COMPELLED THEM REGRETFULLY TO THWART THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE
LJ023-0107 IN THE FACE OF SUCH DISSENTING OPINIONS IT IS PERFECTLY CLEAR THAT AS CHIEF JUSTICE HUGHES HAS SAID
LJ023-0108 WE ARE UNDER A CONSTITUTION BUT THE CONSTITUTION IS WHAT THE JUDGES SAY IT IS
LJ023-0109 THE COURT IN ADDITION TO THE PROPER USE OF ITS JUDICIAL FUNCTIONS HAS IMPROPERLY SET ITSELF UP AS A THIRD HOUSE OF THE CONGRESS
LJ023-0110 A SUPERLEGISLATURE AS ONE OF THE JUSTICES HAS CALLED IT
LJ023-0111 READING INTO THE CONSTITUTION WORDS AND IMPLICATIONS WHICH ARE NOT THERE AND WHICH WERE NEVER INTENDED TO BE THERE
LJ023-0112 WE HAVE THEREFORE
LJ023-0113 REACHED THE POINT AS A NATION WHERE WE MUST TAKE ACTION TO SAVE THE CONSTITUTION FROM THE COURT AND THE COURT FROM ITSELF
LJ023-0114 WE MUST FIND A WAY TO TAKE AN APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT TO THE CONSTITUTION ITSELF
LJ023-0115 WE WANT A SUPREME COURT WHICH WILL DO JUSTICE UNDER THE CONSTITUTION  NOT OVER IT
LJ023-0116 IN OUR COURTS WE WANT A GOVERNMENT OF LAWS AND NOT OF MEN
LJ023-0117 I WANT  AS ALL AMERICANS WANT  AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY AS PROPOSED BY THE FRAMERS OF THE CONSTITUTION
LJ023-0118 THAT MEANS A SUPREME COURT THAT WILL ENFORCE THE CONSTITUTION AS WRITTEN
LJ023-0119 THAT WILL REFUSE TO AMEND THE CONSTITUTION BY THE ARBITRARY EXERCISE OF JUDICIAL POWER  AMENDED BY JUDICIAL SAYSO
LJ023-0120 IT DOES NOT MEAN A JUDICIARY SO INDEPENDENT THAT IT CAN DENY THE EXISTENCE OF FACTS WHICH ARE UNIVERSALLY RECOGNIZED
LJ023-0121 HOW THEN COULD WE PROCEED TO PERFORM THE MANDATE GIVEN US
LJ023-0122 IT WAS SAID IN LAST YEAR'S DEMOCRATIC PLATFORM
LJ023-0123 IF THESE PROBLEMS CANNOT BE EFFECTIVELY SOLVED WITHIN THE CONSTITUTION
LJ023-0124 WE SHALL SEEK SUCH CLARIFYING AMENDMENT AS WILL ASSURE THE POWER TO ENACT THOSE LAWS
LJ023-0125 ADEQUATELY TO REGULATE COMMERCE PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY AND SAFEGUARD ECONOMIC SECURITY
LJ023-0126 IN OTHER WORDS WE SAID WE WOULD SEEK AN AMENDMENT ONLY IF EVERY OTHER POSSIBLE MEANS BY LEGISLATION WERE TO FAIL
LJ023-0127 WHEN I COMMENCED TO REVIEW THE SITUATION WITH THE PROBLEM SQUARELY BEFORE ME
LJ023-0128 I CAME BY A PROCESS OF ELIMINATION TO THE CONCLUSION THAT SHORT OF AMENDMENTS
LJ023-0129 THE ONLY METHOD WHICH WAS CLEARLY CONSTITUTIONAL AND WOULD AT THE SAME TIME CARRY OUT OTHER MUCH NEEDED REFORMS
LJ023-0130 WAS TO INFUSE NEW BLOOD INTO ALL OUR COURTS
LJ023-0131 WE MUST HAVE MEN WORTHY AND EQUIPPED TO CARRY OUT IMPARTIAL JUSTICE
LJ023-0132 BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE MUST HAVE JUDGES WHO WILL BRING TO THE COURTS A PRESENTDAY SENSE OF THE CONSTITUTION
LJ023-0133 JUDGES WHO WILL RETAIN IN THE COURTS THE JUDICIAL FUNCTIONS OF A COURT
LJ023-0134 AND REJECT THE LEGISLATIVE POWERS WHICH THE COURTS HAVE TODAY ASSUMED
LJ023-0135 IN FORTYFIVE OUT OF THE FORTYEIGHT STATES OF THE UNION JUDGES ARE CHOSEN NOT FOR LIFE BUT FOR A PERIOD OF YEARS
LJ023-0136 IN MANY STATES JUDGES MUST RETIRE AT THE AGE OF SEVENTY
LJ023-0137 CONGRESS HAS PROVIDED FINANCIAL SECURITY
LJ023-0138 BY OFFERING LIFE PENSIONS AT FULL PAY FOR FEDERAL JUDGES ON ALL COURTS WHO ARE WILLING TO RETIRE AT SEVENTY
LJ023-0139 IN THE CASE OF SUPREME COURT JUSTICES THAT PENSION IS $20000 A YEAR
LJ023-0140 BUT ALL FEDERAL JUDGES ONCE APPOINTED
LJ023-0141 CAN IF THEY CHOOSE HOLD OFFICE FOR LIFE NO MATTER HOW OLD THEY MAY GET TO BE
LJ024-0001 THE FIRESIDE CHATS OF FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT BY FRANKLIN D ROOSEVELT
LJ024-0002 SECTION TEN MARCH NINE NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN PART TWO
LJ024-0003 WHAT IS MY PROPOSAL
LJ024-0004 IT IS SIMPLY THIS WHENEVER A JUDGE OR JUSTICE OF ANY FEDERAL COURT
LJ024-0005 HAS REACHED THE AGE OF SEVENTY AND DOES NOT AVAIL HIMSELF OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO RETIRE ON A PENSION
LJ024-0006 A NEW MEMBER SHALL BE APPOINTED BY THE PRESIDENT THEN IN OFFICE
LJ024-0007 WITH THE APPROVAL AS REQUIRED BY THE CONSTITUTION OF THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
LJ024-0008 THAT PLAN HAS TWO CHIEF PURPOSES
LJ024-0009 BY BRINGING INTO THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM A STEADY AND CONTINUING STREAM OF NEW AND YOUNGER BLOOD I HOPE FIRST
LJ024-0010 TO MAKE THE ADMINISTRATION OF ALL FEDERAL JUSTICE SPEEDIER AND THEREFORE LESS COSTLY
LJ024-0011 SECONDLY TO BRING TO THE DECISION OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC PROBLEMS YOUNGER MEN WHO HAVE HAD PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND CONTACT
LJ024-0012 WITH MODERN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH AVERAGE MEN HAVE TO LIVE AND WORK
LJ024-0013 THIS PLAN WILL SAVE OUR NATIONAL CONSTITUTION FROM HARDENING OF THE JUDICIAL ARTERIES
LJ024-0014 THE NUMBER OF JUDGES TO BE APPOINTED WOULD DEPEND WHOLLY ON THE DECISION OF PRESENT JUDGES NOW OVER SEVENTY
LJ024-0015 OR THOSE WHO WOULD SUBSEQUENTLY REACH THE AGE OF SEVENTY
LJ024-0016 IF FOR INSTANCE ANY ONE OF THE SIX JUSTICES OF THE SUPREME COURT NOW OVER THE AGE OF SEVENTY SHOULD RETIRE AS PROVIDED UNDER THE PLAN
LJ024-0017 NO ADDITIONAL PLACE WOULD BE CREATED
LJ024-0018 CONSEQUENTLY ALTHOUGH THERE NEVER CAN BE MORE THAN FIFTEEN THERE MAY BE ONLY FOURTEEN OR THIRTEEN OR TWELVE
LJ024-0019 AND THERE MAY BE ONLY NINE
LJ024-0020 THERE IS NOTHING NOVEL OR RADICAL ABOUT THIS IDEA
LJ024-0021 IT SEEKS TO MAINTAIN THE FEDERAL BENCH IN FULL VIGOR
LJ024-0022 IT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED AND APPROVED BY MANY PERSONS OF HIGH AUTHORITY
LJ024-0023 EVER SINCE A SIMILAR PROPOSAL PASSED THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE
LJ024-0024 WHY WAS THE AGE FIXED AT SEVENTY
LJ024-0025 BECAUSE THE LAWS OF MANY STATES THE PRACTICE OF THE CIVIL SERVICE THE REGULATIONS OF THE ARMY AND NAVY
LJ024-0026 AND THE RULES OF MANY OF OUR UNIVERSITIES AND OF ALMOST EVERY GREAT PRIVATE BUSINESS ENTERPRISE
LJ024-0027 COMMONLY FIX THE RETIREMENT AGE AT SEVENTY YEARS OR LESS
LJ024-0028 THE STATUTE WOULD APPLY TO ALL THE COURTS IN THE FEDERAL SYSTEM
LJ024-0029 THERE IS GENERAL APPROVAL SO FAR AS THE LOWER FEDERAL COURTS ARE CONCERNED
LJ024-0030 THE PLAN HAS MET OPPOSITION ONLY SO FAR AS THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES ITSELF IS CONCERNED
LJ024-0031 IF SUCH A PLAN IS GOOD FOR THE LOWER COURTS IT CERTAINLY OUGHT TO BE EQUALLY GOOD FOR THE HIGHEST COURT FROM WHICH THERE IS NO APPEAL
LJ024-0032 THOSE OPPOSING THIS PLAN HAVE SOUGHT TO AROUSE PREJUDICE AND FEAR BY CRYING THAT I AM SEEKING TO PACK THE SUPREME COURT
LJ024-0033 AND THAT A BANEFUL PRECEDENT WILL BE ESTABLISHED
LJ024-0034 WHAT DO THEY MEAN BY THE WORDS PACKING THE COURT
LJ024-0035 LET ME ANSWER THIS QUESTION WITH A BLUNTNESS THAT WILL END ALL HONEST MISUNDERSTANDING OF MY PURPOSES
LJ024-0036 IF BY THAT PHRASE PACKING THE COURT IT IS CHARGED THAT I WISH TO PLACE ON THE BENCH SPINELESS PUPPETS
LJ024-0037 WHO WOULD DISREGARD THE LAW AND WOULD DECIDE SPECIFIC CASES AS I WISHED THEM TO BE DECIDED I MAKE THIS ANSWER
LJ024-0038 THAT NO PRESIDENT FIT FOR HIS OFFICE WOULD APPOINT
LJ024-0039 AND NO SENATE OF HONORABLE MEN FIT FOR THEIR OFFICE WOULD CONFIRM THAT KIND OF APPOINTEES TO THE SUPREME COURT
LJ024-0040 BUT IF BY THAT PHRASE THE CHARGE IS MADE
LJ024-0041 THAT I WOULD APPOINT AND THE SENATE WOULD CONFIRM JUSTICES WORTHY TO SIT BESIDE PRESENT MEMBERS OF THE COURT
LJ024-0042 WHO UNDERSTAND THOSE MODERN CONDITIONS
LJ024-0043 THAT I WILL APPOINT JUSTICES WHO WILL NOT UNDERTAKE TO OVERRIDE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CONGRESS ON LEGISLATIVE POLICY
LJ024-0044 THAT I WILL APPOINT JUSTICES WHO WILL ACT AS JUSTICES AND NOT AS LEGISLATORS
LJ024-0045 IF THE APPOINTMENT OF SUCH JUSTICES CAN BE CALLED PACKING THE COURTS
LJ024-0046 THEN I SAY THAT I AND WITH ME THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FAVOR DOING JUST THAT THING  NOW
LJ024-0047 IS IT A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT FOR THE CONGRESS TO CHANGE THE NUMBER OF THE JUSTICES THE CONGRESS HAS ALWAYS HAD AND WILL HAVE THAT POWER
LJ024-0048 THE NUMBER OF JUSTICES HAS BEEN CHANGED SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE
LJ024-0049 IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF JOHN ADAMS AND THOMAS JEFFERSON  BOTH SIGNERS OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE
LJ024-0050 ANDREW JACKSON ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND ULYSSES S. GRANT
LJ024-0051 I SUGGEST ONLY THE ADDITION OF JUSTICES TO THE BENCH
LJ024-0052 IN ACCORDANCE WITH A CLEARLY DEFINED PRINCIPLE RELATING TO A CLEARLY DEFINED AGE LIMIT
LJ024-0053 FUNDAMENTALLY IF IN THE FUTURE AMERICA CANNOT TRUST THE CONGRESS IT ELECTS TO REFRAIN FROM ABUSE OF OUR CONSTITUTIONAL USAGES
LJ024-0054 DEMOCRACY WILL HAVE FAILED FAR BEYOND THE IMPORTANCE TO IT OF ANY KING OF PRECEDENT CONCERNING THE JUDICIARY
LJ024-0055 WE THINK IT SO MUCH IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST TO MAINTAIN A VIGOROUS JUDICIARY
LJ024-0056 THAT WE ENCOURAGE THE RETIREMENT OF ELDERLY JUDGES BY OFFERING THEM A LIFE PENSION AT FULL SALARY
LJ024-0057 WHY THEN SHOULD WE LEAVE THE FULFILLMENT OF THIS PUBLIC POLICY TO CHANCE
LJ024-0058 OR MAKE INDEPENDENT ON UPON THE DESIRE OR PREJUDICE OF ANY INDIVIDUAL JUSTICE
LJ024-0059 IT IS THE CLEAR INTENTION OF OUR PUBLIC POLICY TO PROVIDE FOR A CONSTANT FLOW OF NEW AND YOUNGER BLOOD INTO THE JUDICIARY
LJ024-0060 NORMALLY EVERY PRESIDENT APPOINTS A LARGE NUMBER OF DISTRICT AND CIRCUIT COURT JUDGES AND A FEW MEMBERS OF THE SUPREME COURT
LJ024-0061 UNTIL MY FIRST TERM PRACTICALLY EVERY PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS APPOINTED AT LEAST ONE MEMBER OF THE SUPREME COURT
LJ024-0062 PRESIDENT TAFT APPOINTED FIVE MEMBERS AND NAMED A CHIEF JUSTICE
LJ024-0063 PRESIDENT WILSON THREE PRESIDENT HARDING FOUR INCLUDING A CHIEF JUSTICE PRESIDENT COOLIDGE ONE
LJ024-0064 PRESIDENT HOOVER THREE INCLUDING A CHIEF JUSTICE
LJ024-0065 SUCH A SUCCESSION OF APPOINTMENTS SHOULD HAVE PROVIDED A COURT WELLBALANCED AS TO AGE
LJ024-0066 BUT CHANCE AND THE DISINCLINATION OF INDIVIDUALS TO LEAVE THE SUPREME BENCH
LJ024-0067 HAVE NOW GIVEN US A COURT IN WHICH FIVE JUSTICES WILL BE OVER SEVENTYFIVE YEARS OF AGE BEFORE NEXT JUNE
LJ024-0068 AND ONE OVER SEVENTY
LJ024-0069 THUS A SOUND PUBLIC POLICY HAS BEEN DEFEATED
LJ024-0070 I NOW PROPOSE THAT WE ESTABLISH BY LAW AN ASSURANCE AGAINST ANY SUCH ILLBALANCED COURT IN THE FUTURE
LJ024-0071 I PROPOSE THAT HEREAFTER WHEN A JUDGE REACHES THE AGE OF SEVENTY
LJ024-0072 A NEW AND YOUNGER JUDGE SHALL BE ADDED TO THE COURT AUTOMATICALLY
LJ024-0073 IN THIS WAY I PROPOSE TO ENFORCE A SOUND PUBLIC POLICY BY LAW
LJ024-0074 INSTEAD OF LEAVING THE COMPOSITION OF OUR FEDERAL COURTS INCLUDING THE HIGHEST
LJ024-0075 TO BE DETERMINED BY CHANCE OR THE PERSONAL INDECISION OF INDIVIDUALS
LJ024-0076 IF SUCH A LAW AS I PROPOSE IS REGARDED AS ESTABLISHING A NEW PRECEDENT
LJ024-0077 IS IT NOT A MOST DESIRABLE PRECEDENT
LJ024-0078 LIKE ALL LAWYERS LIKE ALL AMERICANS I REGRET THE NECESSITY OF THIS CONTROVERSY
LJ024-0079 BUT THE WELFARE OF THE UNITED STATES AND INDEED OF THE CONSTITUTION ITSELF IS WHAT WE ALL MUST THINK ABOUT FIRST
LJ024-0080 OUR DIFFICULTY WITH THE COURT TODAY RISES NOT FROM THE COURT AS AN INSTITUTION BUT FROM HUMAN BEINGS WITHIN IT
LJ024-0081 BUT WE CANNOT YIELD OUR CONSTITUTIONAL DESTINY TO THE PERSONAL JUDGMENT OF A FEW MEN WHO BEING FEARFUL OF THE FUTURE
LJ024-0082 WOULD DENY US THE NECESSARY MEANS OF DEALING WITH THE PRESENT
LJ024-0083 THIS PLAN OF MINE IS NO ATTACK ON THE COURT
LJ024-0084 IT SEEKS TO RESTORE THE COURT TO ITS RIGHTFUL AND HISTORIC PLACE IN OUR CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT
LJ024-0085 AND TO HAVE IT RESUME ITS HIGH TASK OF BUILDING ANEW ON THE CONSTITUTION A SYSTEM OF LIVING LAW
LJ024-0086 THE COURT ITSELF CAN BEST UNDO WHAT THE COURT HAS DONE
LJ024-0087 I HAVE THUS EXPLAINED TO YOU THE REASONS THAT LIE BEHIND OUR EFFORTS TO SECURE RESULTS BY LEGISLATION WITHIN THE CONSTITUTION
LJ024-0088 I HOPE THAT THEREBY THE DIFFICULT PROCESS OF CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT MAY BE RENDERED UNNECESSARY. BUT
LJ024-0089 LET US EXAMINE THE PROCESS
LJ024-0090 THERE ARE MANY TYPES OF AMENDMENT PROPOSED
LJ024-0091 EACH ONE IS RADICALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER
LJ024-0092 THERE IS NO SUBSTANTIAL GROUPS WITHIN THE CONGRESS OR OUTSIDE IT WHO ARE AGREED ON ANY SINGLE AMENDMENT
LJ024-0093 IT WOULD TAKE MONTHS OR YEARS TO GET SUBSTANTIAL AGREEMENT UPON THE TYPE AND LANGUAGE OF THE AMENDMENT
LJ024-0094 IT WOULD TAKE MONTHS AND YEARS THEREAFTER TO GET A TWOTHIRDS MAJORITY IN FAVOR OF THAT AMENDMENT IN BOTH HOUSES OF THE CONGRESS
LJ024-0095 THEN WOULD COME THE LONG COURSE OF RATIFICATION BY THREEFOURTHS OF ALL THE STATES
LJ024-0096 NO AMENDMENT WHICH ANY POWERFUL ECONOMIC INTERESTS OR THE LEADERS OF ANY POWERFUL POLITICAL PARTY HAVE HAD REASON TO OPPOSE
LJ024-0097 HAS EVER BEEN RATIFIED WITHIN ANYTHING LIKE A REASONABLE TIME
LJ024-0098 AND THIRTEEN STATES WHICH CONTAIN ONLY FIVE PERCENT OF THE VOTING POPULATION CAN BLOCK RATIFICATION
LJ024-0099 EVEN THOUGH THE THIRTY FIVE STATES WITH NINETYFIVE PERCENT OF THE POPULATION ARE IN FAVOR OF IT
LJ024-0100 A VERY LARGE PERCENTAGE OF NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE
LJ024-0101 BAR ASSOCIATION MANUFACTURERS' ASSOCIATIONS WHO ARE TRYING TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY REALLY DO WANT A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT
LJ024-0102 WOULD BE THE FIRST TO EXCLAIM AS SOON AS AN AMENDMENT WAS PROPOSED
LJ024-0103 OH I WAS FOR AN AMENDMENT ALL RIGHT BUT THIS AMENDMENT YOU PROPOSED IS NOT THE KIND OF AMENDMENT THAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT
LJ024-0104 I AM THEREFORE GOING TO SPEND MY TIME MY EFFORTS AND MY MONEY
LJ024-0105 TO BLOCK THE AMENDMENT ALTHOUGH I WOULD BE AWFULLY GLAD TO HELP GET SOME OTHER KIND OF AMENDMENT RATIFIED
LJ024-0106 TWO GROUPS OPPOSE MY PLAN ON THE GROUND THAT THEY FAVOR A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT
LJ024-0107 THE FIRST INCLUDES THOSE WHO FUNDAMENTALLY OBJECT TO SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC LEGISLATION ALONG MODERN LINES
LJ024-0108 THIS IS THE SAME GROUP WHO DURING THE CAMPAIGN LAST FALL TRIED TO BLOCK THE MANDATE OF THE PEOPLE
LJ024-0109 NOW THEY ARE MAKING A LAST STAND
LJ024-0110 AND THE STRATEGY OF THAT LAST STAND IS TO SUGGEST THE TIMECONSUMING PROCESS OF AMENDMENT IN ORDER TO KILL OFF BY DELAY
LJ024-0111 THE LEGISLATION DEMANDED BY THE MANDATE
LJ024-0112 TO THEM I SAY I DO NOT THINK YOU WILL BE ABLE LONG TO FOOL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AS TO YOUR PURPOSES
LJ024-0113 THE OTHER GROUPS IS COMPOSED OF THOSE WHO HONESTLY BELIEVE THE AMENDMENT PROCESS IS THE BEST
LJ024-0114 AND WHO WOULD BE WILLING TO SUPPORT A REASONABLE AMENDMENT IF THEY COULD AGREE ON ONE
LJ024-0115 TO THEM I SAY WE CANNOT RELY ON AN AMENDMENT AS THE IMMEDIATE OR ONLY ANSWER TO OUR PRESENT DIFFICULTIES
LJ024-0116 WHEN THE TIME COMES FOR ACTION
LJ024-0117 YOU WILL FIND THAT MANY OF THOSE WHO PRETEND TO SUPPORT YOU WILL SABOTAGE ANY CONSTRUCTIVE AMENDMENT WHICH IS PROPOSED
LJ024-0118 LOOK AT THESE STRANGE BEDFELLOWS OF YOURS
LJ024-0119 WHEN BEFORE HAVE YOU FOUND THEM REALLY AT YOUR SIDE IN YOUR FIGHTS FOR PROGRESS
LJ024-0120 AND REMEMBER ONE THING MORE
LJ024-0121 EVEN IF AN AMENDMENT WERE PASSED AND EVEN IF IN THE YEARS TO COME IT WERE TO BE RATIFIED
LJ024-0122 ITS MEANING WOULD DEPEND UPON THE KIND OF JUSTICES WHO WOULD BE SITTING ON THE SUPREME COURT BENCH
LJ024-0123 AN AMENDMENT LIKE THE REST OF THE CONSTITUTION
LJ024-0124 IS WHAT THE JUSTICES SAY IT IS RATHER THAN WHAT ITS FRAMERS OR YOU MIGHT HOPE IT IS
LJ024-0125 THIS PROPOSAL OF MINE WILL NOT INFRINGE IN THE SLIGHTEST UPON THE CIVIL OR RELIGIOUS LIBERTIES SO DEAR TO EVERY AMERICAN
LJ024-0126 MY RECORD AS GOVERNOR AND PRESIDENT PROVES MY DEVOTION TO THOSE LIBERTIES
LJ024-0127 YOU WHO KNOW ME CAN HAVE NO FEAR THAT I WOULD TOLERATE THE DESTRUCTION BY ANY BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT OF ANY PART OF OUR HERITAGE OF FREEDOM
LJ024-0128 THE PRESENT ATTEMPT BY THOSE OPPOSED TO PROGRESS TO PLAY UPON THE FEARS OF DANGER TO PERSONAL LIBERTY
LJ024-0129 BRINGS AGAIN TO MIND THAT CRUDE AND CRUEL STRATEGY TRIED BY THE SAME OPPOSITION
LJ024-0130 TO FRIGHTEN THE WORKERS OF AMERICA IN A PAYENVELOPE PROPAGANDA AGAINST THE SOCIAL SECURITY LAW
LJ024-0131 THE WORKERS WERE NOT FOOLED BY THAT PROPAGANDA THEN. THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA WILL NOT BE FOOLED BY SUCH PROPAGANDA NOW
LJ024-0132 I AM IN FAVOR OF ACTION THROUGH LEGISLATION
LJ024-0133 FIRST BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT IT CAN BE PASSED AT THIS SESSION OF THE CONGRESS
LJ024-0134 SECOND BECAUSE IT WILL PROVIDE A REINVIGORATED
LJ024-0135 LIBERALMINDED JUDICIARY NECESSARY TO FURNISH QUICKER AND CHEAPER JUSTICE FROM BOTTOM TO TOP
LJ024-0136 THIRD BECAUSE IT WILL PROVIDE A SERIES OF FEDERAL COURTS WILLING TO ENFORCE THE CONSTITUTION AS WRITTEN
LJ024-0137 AND UNWILLING TO ASSERT LEGISLATIVE POWERS BY WRITING INTO IT THEIR OWN POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC POLICIES
LJ024-0138 DURING THE PAST HALF CENTURY THE BALANCE OF POWER BETWEEN THE THREE GREAT BRANCHES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
LJ024-0139 HAS BEEN TIPPED OUT OF BALANCE BY THE COURTS IN DIRECT CONTRADICTION OF THE HIGH PURPOSES OF THE FRAMERS OF THE CONSTITUTION
LJ024-0140 IT IS MY PURPOSE TO RESTORE THAT BALANCE
LJ024-0141 YOU WHO KNOW ME WILL ACCEPT MY SOLEMN ASSURANCE THAT IN A WORLD IN WHICH DEMOCRACY IS UNDER ATTACK
LJ024-0142 I SEEK TO MAKE AMERICAN DEMOCRACY SUCCEED
LJ024-0143 YOU AND I WILL DO OUR PART
LJ025-0001 THE SCIENCE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE VOLUME FIVE
LJ025-0002 EDITED BY FRANCIS ROLTWHEELER BIOLOGY CHAPTER SEVEN ORGANIC FUNCTIONS PART ONE
LJ025-0003 THE FACTS DEALING WITH THE PHYSIOLOGY OF ORGANISMS THE ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT WHICH WE CALL LIFE
LJ025-0004 ARE OFTEN DESIGNATED ORGANIC FUNCTIONS
LJ025-0005 THE TERMS ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND HUMAN PHYSIOLOGY ARE IN COMMON USE AND OFTEN SUGGEST TO THE LAY READER
LJ025-0006 THAT THE FUNCTIONS OR WORKINGS OF THE ORGANS OF PLANTS ANIMALS OR MAN ARE QUITE DISTINCT
LJ025-0007 SO MUCH SO AS TO REQUIRE DISCUSSION IN DIFFERENT TREATISES
LJ025-0008 THIS IS TRUE ONLY AS A MATTER OF DETAIL
LJ025-0009 FOR IN THE PAST FIFTY YEARS IT HAS BEEN MADE EVIDENT THAT IN GENERAL PRINCIPLES ALL LIVING THINGS ARE FUNDAMENTALLY SIMILAR
LJ025-0010 ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SUMMARIES OF THIS SIMILARITY
LJ025-0011 IS HUXLEY'S FAMOUS ESSAY THE BORDER TERRITORY BETWEEN THE ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE KINGDOMS WRITTEN IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX
LJ025-0012 EXTRACTS FROM WHICH FOLLOW
LJ025-0013 IN THE SECOND EDITION OF THE REGNE ANIMAL PUBLISHED IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY EIGHT
LJ025-0014 CUVIER DEVOTES A SPECIAL SECTION TO THE DIVISION OF ORGANIZED BEINGS INTO ANIMALS AND VEGETABLES
LJ025-0015 IN WHICH THE QUESTION IS TREATED WITH THAT COMPREHENSIVENESS OF KNOWLEDGE AND CLEAR CRITICAL JUDGMENT WHICH CHARACTERIZE HIS WRITINGS
LJ025-0016 AND JUSTIFY BIOLOGISTS IN REGARDING THEM AS REPRESENTATIVE EXPRESSIONS OF THE MOST EXTENSIVE IF NOT THE PROFOUNDEST KNOWLEDGE OF HIS TIME
LJ025-0017 HE AFFIRMS THAT LIVING BEINGS HAVE BEEN SUBDIVIDED FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES INTO ANIMATED BEINGS WHICH POSSESS SENSE AND MOTION
LJ025-0018 AND INANIMATED BEINGS WHICH ARE DEVOID OF THESE FUNCTIONS AND SIMPLY VEGETABLE
LJ025-0019 ALTHOUGH THE ROOTS OF PLANTS DIRECT THEMSELVES TOWARD MOISTURE AND THEIR LEAVES TOWARD AIR AND LIGHT
LJ025-0020 ALTHOUGH THE PARTS OF SOME PLANTS EXHIBIT OSCILLATING MOVEMENTS WITHOUT ANY PERCEPTIBLE CAUSE AND THE LEAVES OF OTHERS RETRACT WHEN TOUCHED
LJ025-0021 YET NONE OF THESE MOVEMENTS JUSTIFY THE ASCRIPTION TO PLANTS OF PERCEPTION OF WILL
LJ025-0022 FROM THE MOBILITY OF ANIMALS CUVIER WITH HIS CHARACTERISTIC PARTIALITY FOR TELEOLOGICAL REASONING
LJ025-0023 REDUCES THE NECESSITY OF THE EXISTENCE IN THEM OF AN ALIMENTARY CAVITY OR RESERVOIR OF FOOD
LJ025-0024 WHENCE THEIR NUTRITION MAY BE DRAWN BY VESSELS WHICH ARE A SORT OF INTERNAL ROOTS AND IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS ALIMENTARY CAVITY
LJ025-0025 HE NATURALLY SEES THE PRIMARY AND THE MOST IMPORTANT DISTINCTION BETWEEN ANIMALS AND PLANTS
LJ025-0026 FOLLOWING OUT HIS TELEOLOGICAL ARGUMENT CUVIER REMARKS THAT THE ORGANIZATION OF THIS CAVITY
LJ025-0027 AND ITS APPURTENANCES MUST NEEDS VARY ACCORDING TO THE NATURE OF THE ALIMENT AND THE OPERATIONS WHICH IT HAS TO UNDERGO
LJ025-0028 BEFORE IT CAN BE CONVERTED INTO SUBSTANCES FITTED FOR ABSORPTION
LJ025-0029 WHILE THE ATMOSPHERE AND THE EARTH SUPPLY PLANTS WITH JUICES READY PREPARED AND WHICH CAN BE ABSORBED IMMEDIATELY
LJ025-0030 AS THE ANIMAL BODY REQUIRED TO BE INDEPENDENT OF HEAT AND OF THE ATMOSPHERE
LJ025-0031 THERE WERE NO MEANS BY WHICH THE MOTION OF ITS FLUIDS COULD BE PRODUCED BY INTERNAL CAUSES
LJ025-0032 HENCE AROSE THE SECOND GREAT DISTINCTIVE CHARACTER OF ANIMALS OR THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM WHICH IS LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE DIGESTIVE
LJ025-0033 SINCE IT WAS UNNECESSARY AND THEREFORE IS ABSENT IN THE MORE SIMPLE ANIMALS
LJ025-0034 ANIMALS FURTHER NEEDED MUSCLES FOR LOCOMOTION AND NERVES FOR SENSIBILITY
LJ025-0035 HENCE SAYS CUVIER IT WAS NECESSARY THAT THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THE ANIMAL BODY SHOULD BE MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT OF THE PLANT
LJ025-0036 AND IT IS SO INASMUCH AS AN ADDITIONAL SUBSTANCE  NITROGEN  ENTERS INTO IT AS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT
LJ025-0037 WHILE IN PLANTS NITROGEN IS ONLY ACCIDENTALLY JOINED WITH THE THREE OTHER FUNDAMENTAL CONSTITUENTS OF ORGANIC BEINGS
LJ025-0038 CARBON HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN
LJ025-0039 HE AFTERWARD AFFIRMS THAT NITROGEN IS PECULIAR TO ANIMALS AND HEREIN HE PLACES THE THIRD DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE ANIMAL AND THE PLANT
LJ025-0040 THE SOIL AND THE ATMOSPHERE SUPPLY PLANTS WITH WATER COMPOSED OF HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN
LJ025-0041 AND CARBONIC ACID CONTAINING CARBON AND OXYGEN
LJ025-0042 THEY RETAIN THE HYDROGEN AND THE CARBON EXHALE THE SUPERFLUOUS OXYGEN AND ABSORB LITTLE OR NO NITROGEN
LJ025-0043 THE ESSENTIAL CHARACTER OF VEGETABLE LIFE IS THE EXHALATION OF OXYGEN WHICH IS EFFECTED THROUGH THE AGENCY OF LIGHT
LJ025-0044 ANIMALS ON THE CONTRARY DERIVE THEIR NOURISHMENT EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM PLANTS
LJ025-0045 THEY GET RID OF THE SUPERFLUOUS HYDROGEN AND CARBON AND ACCUMULATE NITROGEN
LJ025-0046 THE RELATIONS OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS TO THE ATMOSPHERE ARE THEREFORE INVERSE
LJ025-0047 THE PLANT WITHDRAWS WATER AND CARBONIC ACID FROM THE ATMOSPHERE THE ANIMAL CONTRIBUTES BOTH TO IT
LJ025-0048 RESPIRATION  THAT IS THE ABSORPTION OF OXYGEN AND THE EXHALATION OF CARBONIC ACID
LJ025-0049 IS THE SPECIALLY ANIMAL FUNCTION OF ANIMALS AND CONSTITUTES THEIR FOURTH DISTINCTIVE CHARACTER
LJ025-0050 THUS WROTE CUVIER IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY EIGHT
LJ025-0051 BUT IN THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DECADES OF THIS CENTURY
LJ025-0052 THE GREATEST AND MOST RAPID REVOLUTION WHICH BIOLOGICAL SCIENCE HAS EVER UNDERGONE WAS EFFECTED BY THE APPLICATION OF THE MODERN MICROSCOPE
LJ025-0053 TO THE INVESTIGATION OF ORGANIC STRUCTURE
LJ025-0054 BY THE INTRODUCTION OF EXACT AND EASILY MANAGEABLE METHODS OF CONDUCTING THE CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS AND FINALLY
LJ025-0055 BY THE EMPLOYMENT OF INSTRUMENTS OF PRECISION FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF THE PHYSICAL FORCES WHICH ARE AT WORK IN THE LIVING ECONOMY
LJ025-0056 THAT THE SEMIFLUID CONTENTS WHICH WE NOW TERM PROTOPLASM OF THE CELLS OF CERTAIN PLANTS
LJ025-0057 SUCH AS THE CHARAE ARE IN CONSTANT AND REGULAR MOTION WAS MADE OUT BY BONAVENTURA CORTI A CENTURY AGO
LJ025-0058 BUT THE FACT IMPORTANT AS IT WAS FELL INTO OBLIVION AND HAD TO BE REDISCOVERED BY TREVIRANUS IN 1807
LJ025-0059 ROBERT BROWN NOTED THE MORE COMPLEX MOTIONS OF THE PROTOPLASM IN THE CELLS OF TRADESCANTIA IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY ONE
LJ025-0060 AND NOW SUCH MOVEMENTS OF THE LIVING SUBSTANCE OF PLANTS ARE WELL KNOWN TO BE SOME OF THE MOST WIDELY PREVALENT PHENOMENA OF VEGETABLE LIFE
LJ025-0061 AGARDH AND OTHER OF THE BOTANISTS OF CUVIER'S GENERATION WHO OCCUPIED THEMSELVES WITH THE LOWER PLANTS HAD OBSERVED THAT
LJ025-0062 UNDER PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES THE CONTENTS OF THE CELLS OF CERTAIN WATERWEEDS WERE SET FREE AND MOVED ABOUT WITH CONSIDERABLE VELOCITY
LJ025-0063 AND WITH ALL THE APPEARANCES OF SPONTANEITY AS LOCOMOTIVE BODIES
LJ025-0064 WHICH FROM THEIR SIMILARITY TO ANIMALS OF SIMPLE ORGANIZATION WERE CALLED ZOOSPORES
LJ025-0065 EVEN AS LATE AS EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE HOWEVER A BOTANIST OF SCHLEIDEN'S EMINENCE DEALT VERY SKEPTICALLY WITH THESE STATEMENTS
LJ025-0066 AND HIS SKEPTICISM WAS THE MORE JUSTIFIED SINCE EHRENBERG IN HIS ELABORATE AND COMPREHENSIVE WORK ON THE INFUSORIA
LJ025-0067 HAD DECLARED THE GREATER NUMBER OF WHAT ARE NOW RECOGNIZED AS LOCOMOTIVE PLANTS TO BE ANIMALS
LJ025-0068 AT THE PRESENT DAY WRITES HUXLEY
LJ025-0069 INNUMERABLE PLANTS AND FREE PLANT CELLS ARE KNOWN TO PASS THE WHOLE OR PART OF THEIR LIVES IN AN ACTIVELY LOCOMOTIVE CONDITION
LJ025-0070 IN NOWISE DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THAT OF ONE OF THE SIMPLER ANIMALS AND
LJ025-0071 WHILE IN THIS CONDITION THEIR MOVEMENTS ARE TO ALL APPEARANCES AS SPONTANEOUS  AS MUCH THE PRODUCT OF VOLITION  AS THOSE OF SUCH ANIMALS
LJ025-0072 HENCE THE TELEOLOGICAL ARGUMENT FOR CUVIER'S FIRST DIAGNOSTIC CHARACTER
LJ025-0073 THE PRESENCE IN ANIMALS OF AN ALIMENTARY CAVITY OR INTERNAL POCKET IN WHICH THEY CAN CARRY ABOUT THEIR NUTRIMENT
LJ025-0074 HAS BROKEN DOWN SO FAR AT LEAST AS HIS MODE OF STATING IT GOES AND
LJ025-0075 WITH THE ADVANCE OF MICROSCOPIC ANATOMY THE UNIVERSALITY OF THE FACT ITSELF AMONG ANIMALS HAS CEASED TO BE PREDICABLE
LJ025-0076 MANY ANIMALS OF EVEN COMPLEX STRUCTURE WHICH LIVE PARASITICALLY WITHIN OTHERS ARE WHOLLY DEVOID OF AN ALIMENTARY CAVITY
LJ025-0077 THEIR FOOD IS PROVIDED FOR THEM
LJ025-0078 NOT ONLY READY COOKED BUT READY DIGESTED AND THE ALIMENTARY CANAL BECOME SUPERFLUOUS HAS DISAPPEARED AND AGAIN
LJ025-0079 THE MALES OF MOST ROTIFERS HAVE NO DIGESTIVE APPARATUS
LJ025-0080 FINALLY AMID THE LOWEST FORMS OF ANIMAL LIFE THE SPECK OF GELATINOUS PROTOPLASM WHICH CONSTITUTES THE WHOLE BODY
LJ025-0081 HAS NO PERMANENT DIGESTIVE CAVITY OR MOUTH BUT TAKES IN ITS FOOD ANYWHERE AND DIGESTS SO TO SPEAK ALL OVER ITS BODY
LJ025-0082 BUT ALTHOUGH CUVIER'S LEADING DIAGNOSIS OF THE ANIMAL FROM THE PLANT WILL NOT STAND A STRICT TEST
LJ025-0083 IT REMAINS ONE OF THE MOST CONSTANT OF THE DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERS OF ANIMALS
LJ025-0084 AND IF WE SUBSTITUTE FOR THE POSSESSION OF AN ALIMENTARY CAVITY THE POWER OF TAKING SOLID NUTRIMENT INTO THE BODY AND THERE DIGESTING IT
LJ025-0085 THE DEFINITION SO CHANGED WILL COVER ALL ANIMALS EXCEPT CERTAIN PARASITES
LJ025-0086 AND THE FEW AND EXCEPTIONAL CASES OF NONPARASITIC ANIMALS WHICH DO NOT FEED AT ALL
LJ025-0087 ON THE OTHER HAND THE DEFINITION THUS AMENDED WILL EXCLUDE ALL ORDINARY VEGETABLE ORGANISMS
LJ025-0088 CUVIER HIMSELF PRACTICALLY GIVES UP HIS SECOND DISTINCTIVE MARK WHEN HE ADMITS THAT IT IS WANTING IN THE SIMPLER ANIMALS
LJ025-0089 THE THIRD DISTINCTION IS BASED ON A COMPLETELY ERRONEOUS CONCEPTION OF THE CHEMICAL DIFFERENCES
LJ025-0090 AND RESEMBLANCES BETWEEN THE CONSTITUENTS OF ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE ORGANISMS FOR WHICH CUVIER IS NOT RESPONSIBLE
LJ025-0091 AS IT WAS CURRENT AMONG CONTEMPORARY CHEMISTS
LJ025-0092 IT IS NOW ESTABLISHED THAT NITROGEN IS AS ESSENTIAL A CONSTITUENT OF VEGETABLE AS OF ANIMAL LIVING MATTER
LJ025-0093 AND THAT THE LATTER IS CHEMICALLY SPEAKING JUST AS COMPLICATED AS THE FORMER
LJ025-0094 STARCHY SUBSTANCES CELLULOSE AND SUGAR
LJ025-0095 ONCE SUPPOSED TO BE EXCLUSIVELY CONFINED TO PLANTS ARE NOW KNOWN TO BE REGULAR AND NORMAL PRODUCTS OF ANIMALS
LJ025-0096 AMYLACEOUS AND SACCHARINE SUBSTANCES ARE LARGELY MANUFACTURED EVEN BY THE HIGHEST ANIMALS
LJ025-0097 CELLULOSE IS WIDESPREAD AS A CONSTITUENT OF THE SKELETONS OF THE LOWER ANIMALS
LJ025-0098 AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT AMYLOID SUBSTANCES ARE UNIVERSALLY PRESENT IN THE ANIMAL ORGANISM THOUGH NOT IN THE PRECISE FORM OF STARCH
LJ025-0099 MOREOVER ALTHOUGH IT REMAINS TRUE THAT THERE IS AN INVERSE RELATION BETWEEN THE GREEN PLANT IN SUNSHINE AND THE ANIMAL
LJ025-0100 IN SO FAR AS UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE GREEN PLANT
LJ025-0101 DECOMPOSES CARBONIC ACID AND EXHALES OXYGEN WHILE THE ANIMAL ABSORBS OXYGEN AND EXHALES CARBONIC ACID
LJ025-0102 YET THE EXACT RESEARCHES OF THE MODERN CHEMICAL INVESTIGATORS OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESSES OF PLANTS HAVE CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED THE FALLACY
LJ025-0103 OF ATTEMPTING TO DRAW ANY GENERAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN ANIMALS AND VEGETABLES ON THIS GROUND. IN FACT THE DIFFERENCE VANISHES WITH THE SUNSHINE
LJ025-0104 EVEN IN THE CASE OF THE GREEN PLANT WHICH IN THE DARK ABSORBS OXYGEN AND GIVES OUT CARBONIC ACID LIKE ANY ANIMAL
LJ025-0105 ON THE OTHER HAND THOSE PLANTS SUCH AS THE FUNGI
LJ025-0106 WHICH CONTAIN NO CHLOROPHYLL AND ARE NOT GREEN ARE ALWAYS SO FAR AS RESPIRATION IS CONCERNED IN THE EXACT POSITION OF ANIMALS
LJ025-0107 THEY ABSORB OXYGEN AND GIVE OUT CARBONIC ACID
LJ025-0108 THUS BY THE PROGRESS OF KNOWLEDGE CUVIER'S FOURTH DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE ANIMAL AND THE PLANT
LJ025-0109 HAS BEEN AS COMPLETELY INVALIDATED AS THE THIRD AND SECOND AND EVEN THE FIRST CAN BE RETAINED ONLY IN A MODIFIED FORM
LJ025-0110 AND SUBJECT TO EXCEPTIONS
LJ025-0111 BUT HAS THE ADVANCE OF BIOLOGY SIMPLY TENDED TO BREAK DOWN OLD DISTINCTIONS WITHOUT ESTABLISHING NEW ONES
LJ025-0112 WITH A QUALIFICATION TO BE CONSIDERED PRESENTLY THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION IS UNDOUBTEDLY IN THE AFFIRMATIVE
LJ025-0113 THE FAMOUS RESEARCHES OF SCHWANN AND SCHLEIDEN IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN AND THE FOLLOWING YEARS
LJ025-0114 FOUNDED THE MODERN SCIENCE OF HISTOLOGY OR THAT BRANCH OF ANATOMY WHICH DEALS WITH THE ULTIMATE VISIBLE STRUCTURE OF ORGANISMS AS REVEALED BY THE MICROSCOPE
LJ025-0115 AND FROM THAT DAY TO THIS THE RAPID IMPROVEMENT OF METHODS OF INVESTIGATION AND THE ENERGY OF A HOST OF ACCURATE OBSERVERS
LJ025-0116 HAVE GIVEN GREATER AND GREATER BREADTH AND FIRMNESS TO SCHWANN'S GREAT GENERALIZATION
LJ025-0117 THAT A FUNDAMENTAL UNITY OF STRUCTURE OBTAINS IN ANIMALS AND PLANTS
LJ025-0118 AND THAT HOWEVER DIVERSE MAY BE THE FABRICS OR TISSUES OF WHICH THEIR BODIES ARE COMPOSED ALL THESE VARIED STRUCTURES RESULT
LJ025-0119 FROM THE METAMORPHOSIS OF MORPHOLOGICAL UNITS TERMED CELLS IN A MORE GENERAL SENSE THAN THAT IN WHICH THE WORD CELLS WAS AT FIRST EMPLOYED
LJ025-0120 WHICH ARE NOT ONLY SIMILAR IN ANIMALS AND IN PLANTS RESPECTIVELY
LJ025-0121 BUT PRESENT A CLOSE RESEMBLANCE WHEN THOSE OF ANIMALS AND THOSE OF PLANTS ARE COMPARED TOGETHER
LJ025-0122 THE CONTRACTILITY WHICH IS THE FUNDAMENTAL CONDITION OF LOCOMOTION CONTINUES HUXLEY
LJ025-0123 HAS NOT ONLY BEEN DISCOVERED TO EXIST FAR MORE WIDELY AMONG PLANTS THAN WAS FORMERLY IMAGINED
LJ025-0124 BUT IN THE PLANTS THE ACT OF CONTRACTION HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE ACCOMPANIED
LJ025-0125 AS DR. BURDON SANDERSON'S INTERESTING INVESTIGATIONS HAVE SHOWN BY A DISTURBANCE OF THE ELECTRICAL STATE OF THE CONTRACTILE SUBSTANCE
LJ025-0126 COMPARABLE TO THAT WHICH WAS FOUND BY DU BOIS REYMOND TO BE A CONCOMITANT OF THE ACTIVITY OF ORDINARY MUSCLE IN ANIMALS. AGAIN
LJ025-0127 I KNOW OF NO TEST BY WHICH THE REACTION OF THE LEAVES OF THE SUNDEW AND OF OTHER PLANTS TO STIMULI SO FULLY AND CAREFULLY STUDIED BY MR. DARWIN
LJ025-0128 CAN BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THOSE ACTS OF CONTRACTION FOLLOWING UPON STIMULI WHICH ARE CALLED REFLEX IN ANIMALS
LJ025-0129 ON EACH LOBE OF THE BILOBED LEAF OF VENUS FLYTRAP ARE THREE DELICATE FILAMENTS WHICH STAND OUT AT RIGHT ANGLES FROM THE SURFACE OF THE LEAF
LJ025-0130 TOUCH ONE OF THEM WITH THE END OF A FINE HUMAN HAIR
LJ025-0131 AND THE LOBES OF THE LEAF INSTANTLY CLOSE TOGETHER IN VIRTUE OF AN ACT OF CONTRACTION OF PART OF THEIR SUBSTANCE
LJ025-0132 JUST AS THE BODY OF A SNAIL CONTRACTS INTO ITS SHELL WHEN ONE OF ITS HORNS IS IRRITATED
LJ025-0133 THE REFLEX ACTION OF THE SNAIL IS THE RESULT OF THE PRESENCE OF A NERVOUS SYSTEM IN THE ANIMAL
LJ025-0134 A MOLECULAR CHANGE TAKES PLACE IN THE NERVE OF THE TENTACLE
LJ025-0135 IS PROPAGATED TO THE MUSCLES BY WHICH THE BODY IS RETRACTED AND CAUSING THEM TO CONTRACT THE ACT OF RETRACTION IS BROUGHT ABOUT
LJ025-0136 OF COURSE THE SIMILARITY OF THE ACTS DOES NOT NECESSARILY INVOLVE THE CONCLUSION THAT THE MECHANISM BY WHICH THEY ARE EFFECTED IS THE SAME
LJ025-0137 BUT IT SUGGESTS A SUSPICION OF THEIR IDENTITY WHICH NEEDS CAREFUL TESTING
LJ025-0138 THE RESULTS OF INQUIRIES INTO THE STRUCTURE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OF ANIMALS
LJ025-0139 CONVERGE TOWARD THE CONCLUSION THAT THE NERVE FIBERS WHICH HAVE BEEN REGARDED AS ULTIMATE ELEMENTS OF NERVOUS TISSUE
LJ025-0140 ARE NOT SUCH BUT ARE SIMPLY THE VISIBLE AGGREGATIONS OF VASTLY MORE ATTENUATED FILAMENTS
LJ025-0141 THE DIAMETER OF WHICH DWINDLES DOWN TO THE LIMITS OF OUR PRESENT MICROSCOPIC VISION
LJ025-0142 GREATLY AS THESE HAVE BEEN EXTENDED BY MODERN IMPROVEMENTS OF THE MICROSCOPE AND THAT A NERVE IS IN ITS ESSENCE
LJ025-0143 NOTHING BUT A LINEAR TRACT OF SPECIALLY MODIFIED PROTOPLASM BETWEEN TWO POINTS OF AN ORGANISM
LJ025-0144 ONE OF WHICH IS ABLE TO AFFECT THE OTHER BY MEANS OF THE COMMUNICATION SO ESTABLISHED
LJ025-0145 HENCE IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT EVEN THE SIMPLEST LIVING BEING MAY POSSESS A NERVOUS SYSTEM
LJ025-0146 AND THE QUESTION WHETHER PLANTS ARE PROVIDED WITH A NERVOUS SYSTEM OR NOT THUS ACQUIRES A NEW ASPECT AND PRESENTS THE HISTOLOGIST AND PHYSIOLOGIST
LJ025-0147 WITH A PROBLEM OF EXTREME DIFFICULTY WHICH MUST BE ATTACKED FROM A NEW POINT OF VIEW AND BY THE AID OF METHODS WHICH HAVE YET TO BE INVENTED
LJ025-0148 THUS IT MUST BE ADMITTED HE SAYS AGAIN THAT PLANTS MAY BE CONTRACTILE AND LOCOMOTIVE
LJ025-0149 THAT WHILE LOCOMOTIVE THEIR MOVEMENTS MAY HAVE AS MUCH APPEARANCE OF SPONTANEITY AS THOSE OF THE LOWEST ANIMALS
LJ025-0150 AND THAT MANY EXHIBIT ACTIONS COMPARABLE TO THOSE WHICH ARE BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE AGENCY OF A NERVOUS SYSTEM IN ANIMALS
LJ025-0151 AND IT MUST BE ALLOWED TO BE POSSIBLE THAT FURTHER RESEARCH MAY REVEAL THE EXISTENCE OF SOMETHING COMPARABLE TO A NERVOUS SYSTEM IN PLANTS
LJ025-0152 SO THAT I KNOW NOT WHERE WE CAN HOPE TO FIND ANY ABSOLUTE DISTINCTION BETWEEN ANIMALS AND PLANTS UNLESS WE RETURN TO THEIR MODE OF NUTRITION
LJ025-0153 AND INQUIRE WHETHER CERTAIN DIFFERENCES OF A MORE OCCULT CHARACTER THAN THOSE IMAGINED TO EXIST BY CUVIER
LJ025-0154 AND WHICH CERTAINLY HOLD GOOD FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF ANIMALS AND PLANTS ARE OF UNIVERSAL APPLICATION
LJ025-0155 A BEAN MAY BE SUPPLIED WITH WATER IN WHICH SALTS OF AMMONIA AND CERTAIN OTHER MINERAL SALTS ARE DISSOLVED IN DUE PROPORTION
LJ025-0156 WITH ATMOSPHERIC AIR CONTAINING ITS ORDINARY MINUTE DOSE OF CARBONIC ACID AND WITH NOTHING ELSE BUT SUNLIGHT AND HEAT
LJ025-0157 UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES UNNATURAL AS THEY ARE WITH PROPER MANAGEMENT THE BEAN WILL THRUST FORTH ITS RADICLE AND ITS PLUMULE
LJ025-0158 THE FORMER WILL GROW DOWN INTO ROOTS THE LATTER GROW UP INTO THE STEM AND LEAVES OF A VIGOROUS BEANPLANT
LJ025-0159 AND THIS PLANT WILL IN DUE TIME FLOWER AND PRODUCE ITS CROP OF BEANS JUST AS IF IT WERE GROWN IN THE GARDEN OR IN THE FIELD
LJ025-0160 THE WEIGHT OF THE NITROGENOUS PROTEIN COMPOUNDS
LJ025-0161 OF THE OILY STARCHY SACCHARINE AND WOODY SUBSTANCES CONTAINED IN THE FULLGROWN PLANT AND ITS SEEDS
LJ025-0162 WILL BE VASTLY GREATER THAN THE WEIGHT OF THE SAME SUBSTANCES CONTAINED IN THE BEAN FROM WHICH IT SPRANG
LJ025-0163 BUT NOTHING HAS BEEN SUPPLIED TO THE BEAN SAVE WATER CARBONIC ACID AMMONIA POTASH LIME
LJ025-0164 IRON AND THE LIKE IN COMBINATION WITH PHOSPHORIC SULPHURIC AND OTHER ACIDS
LJ025-0165 NEITHER PROTEIN NOR FAT NOR STARCH NOR SUGAR NOR ANY SUBSTANCE IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE RESEMBLING THEM HAS FORMED PART OF THE FOOD OF THE BEAN
LJ025-0166 BUT THE WEIGHTS OF THE CARBON HYDROGEN OXYGEN NITROGEN PHOSPHORUS SULFUR AND OTHER ELEMENTARY BODIES CONTAINED IN THE BEANPLANT
LJ025-0167 AND IN THE SEEDS WHICH IT PRODUCES ARE EXACTLY EQUIVALENT TO THE WEIGHTS OF THE SAME ELEMENTS WHICH HAVE DISAPPEARED FROM THE MATERIALS SUPPLIED TO THE BEAN DURING ITS GROWTH
LJ025-0168 WHENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT THE BEAN HAS TAKEN IN ONLY THE RAW MATERIALS OF ITS FABRIC AND HAS MANUFACTURED THEM INTO BEANSTUFFS
LJ025-0169 THE BEAN HAS BEEN ABLE TO PERFORM THIS GREAT CHEMICAL FEAT BY THE HELP OF ITS GREEN COLORING MATTER OR CHLOROPHYLL
LJ025-0170 FOR IT IS ONLY THE GREEN PARTS OF THE PLANT WHICH UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF SUNLIGHT HAVE THE MARVELOUS POWER OF DECOMPOSING CARBONIC ACID
LJ025-0171 SETTING FREE THE OXYGEN AND LAYING HOLD OF THE CARBON WHICH IT CONTAINS
LJ025-0172 IN FACT THE BEAN OBTAINS TWO OF THE ABSOLUTELY INDISPENSABLE ELEMENTS OF ITS SUBSTANCE FROM TWO DISTINCT SOURCES
LJ025-0173 THE WATERY SOLUTION IN WHICH ITS ROOTS ARE PLUNGED CONTAINS NITROGEN BUT NO CARBON
LJ025-0174 THE AIR TO WHICH THE LEAVES ARE EXPOSED CONTAINS CARBON
LJ025-0175 BUT ITS NITROGEN IS IN THE STATE OF A FREE GAS IN WHICH CONDITION THE BEAN CAN MAKE NO USE OF IT
LJ025-0176 AND THE CHLOROPHYLL IS THE APPARATUS BY WHICH THE CARBON IS EXTRACTED FROM THE ATMOSPHERIC CARBONIC ACID THE LEAVES BEING THE CHIEF LABORATORIES
LJ026-0001 THE SCIENCE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE VOLUME FIVE EDITED BY FRANCIS ROLTWHEELER BIOLOGY CHAPTER EIGHT
LJ026-0002 LIFE PROCESSES PART ONE
LJ026-0003 NUTRITION THUS AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO CLASSIFY MOST ORGANISMS AS ANIMALS OR PLANTS
LJ026-0004 YET THERE ARE MANY UNICELLULAR FORMS IN WHICH BOTH KINDS OF NUTRITION GO ON AT THE SAME TIME
LJ026-0005 THAT IS THE FORMS MAY POSSESS A MOUTH FOR THE INGESTION OF SOLID FOOD AND GREEN COLORING MATTER CHLOROPHYLL
LJ026-0006 FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF STARCHY FOOD FROM GASEOUS MATTER
LJ026-0007 MANY OF THE LOWEST FORMS OF LIFE HAVE LONG BEEN PUZZLES
LJ026-0008 AND THE BEGINNER IN BIOLOGICAL STUDY IS SURPRISED TO FIND THEM DESCRIBED IN TEXTBOOKS OF BOTH BOTANY AND ZOOLOGY
LJ026-0009 THE FACT IS THAT THEY ARE ON THE BORDER LINE ARE NEITHER PLANTS NOR ANIMALS BUT SIMPLY ORGANISMS
LJ026-0010 SINCE THEY CANNOT BE CLASSIFIED IT IS NECESSARY THAT THEY BE LISTED BOTH UNDER BOTANY AND ZOOLOGY IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WILL NOT BE OMITTED ENTIRELY
LJ026-0011 BECAUSE OF THESE UNCERTAIN FORMS OF LIFE
LJ026-0012 HAECKEL PROPOSED ONCE TO INCLUDE ALL ONECELLED ANIMALS AND PLANTS IN A THIRD KINGDOM TO BE CALLED PROTISTA MEANING THE FIRST OF ALL LIFE
LJ026-0013 PARKER'S DEFINITION OF ANIMALS AND PLANTS
LJ026-0014 BASED ON THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS IS CONVENIENT FOR DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN ANIMALS AND PLANTS IN ALL CASES EXCEPT THE DOUBTFUL UNICELLAR FORMS
LJ026-0015 HE SAYS ANIMALS ARE ORGANISMS OF FIXED AND DEFINITE FORM IN WHICH THE CELLBODY IS NOT COVERED WITH A CELLULOSE WALL
LJ026-0016 THEY INGEST SOLID PROTEINACEOUS FOOD
LJ026-0017 THEIR NUTRITIVE PROCESSES RESULT IN OXIDATION THEY HAVE A DEFINITE ORGAN OF EXCRETION AND ARE CAPABLE OF AUTOMATIC MOVEMENT
LJ026-0018 PLANTS ARE ORGANISMS OF CONSTANTLY VARYING FORM IN WHICH THE CELL BODY IS SURROUNDED BY A CELLULOSE WALL
LJ026-0019 THEY CANNOT INGEST SOLID FOOD BUT ARE NOURISHED BY A WATERY SOLUTION OF NUTRIENT MATERIALS
LJ026-0020 IF CHLOROPHYLL IS PRESENT THE CARBON DIOXIDE OF THE AIR SERVES AS A SOURCE OF CARBON
LJ026-0021 NITROGEN IS OBTAINED FROM SIMPLE SALTS AND THE NUTRITIVE PROCESSES RESULT IN DEOXIDATION
LJ026-0022 IF CHLOROPHYLL IS ABSENT CARBON IS OBTAINED FROM SUGAR OR SOME SIMILAR COMPOUND
LJ026-0023 NITROGEN EITHER FROM SIMPLE SALTS OR FROM PROTEIDS AND THE PROCESS OF NUTRITION IS ONE OF OXIDATION
LJ026-0024 THERE IS NO SPECIAL EXCRETORY ORGAN AND EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF CERTAIN REPRODUCTIVE BODIES THERE IS USUALLY NO LOCOMOTION
LJ026-0025 THE IMPORTANT POINT TO RECOGNIZE IS THAT THESE BOUNDARIES ARE ARTIFICIAL AND THAT THERE ARE NO SCIENTIFIC FRONTIERS IN NATURE
LJ026-0026 AS IN THE LIQUEFACTION OF GASES THERE IS A CRITICAL POINT AT WHICH THE SUBSTANCE UNDER EXPERIMENT IS NEITHER GASEOUS NOR LIQUID
LJ026-0027 AS IN A MOUNTAINOUS COUNTRY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHERE MOUNTAIN ENDS AND VALLEY BEGINS AS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ANIMAL
LJ026-0028 IT IS FUTILE TO ARGUE ABOUT THE EXACT PERIOD WHEN FOR INSTANCE THE EGG BECOMES A TADPOLE OR THE TADPOLE A FROG
LJ026-0029 SO IN THE CASE UNDER DISCUSSION
LJ026-0030 THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE HIGHER PLANTS AND ANIMALS IS PERFECTLY SHARP AND OBVIOUS
LJ026-0031 BUT WHEN THE TWO GROUPS ARE TRACED DOWNWARD THEY ARE FOUND GRADUALLY TO MERGE
LJ026-0032 AS IT WERE INTO AN ASSEMBLAGE OF ORGANISMS WHICH PARTAKE OF THE CHARACTERS OF BOTH KINGDOMS AND CANNOT WITHOUT A CERTAIN VIOLENCE
LJ026-0033 BE EITHER INCLUDED IN OR EXCLUDED FROM EITHER
LJ026-0034 WHEN ANY GIVEN PROTIST HAS TO BE CLASSIFIED THE CASE MUST BE DECIDED ON ITS INDIVIDUAL MERITS
LJ026-0035 THE ORGANISM MUST BE COMPARED IN DETAIL WITH ALL THOSE WHICH RESEMBLE IT CLOSELY IN STRUCTURE PHYSIOLOGY AND LIFE HISTORY
LJ026-0036 AND THEN A BALANCE MUST BE STRUCK AND THE DOUBTFUL FORM PLACED IN THE KINGDOM WITH WHICH IT HAS ON THE WHOLE MOST POINTS IN COMMON
LJ026-0037 IT WILL NO DOUBT OCCUR TO THE READER THAT ON THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION
LJ026-0038 THE FACT OF THE ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE KINGDOMS BEING RELATED TO ONE ANOTHER LIKE TWO TREES UNITED AT THE ROOTS MAY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE HYPOTHESIS THAT
LJ026-0039 THE EARLIEST ORGANISMS WERE PROTISTS AND THAT FROM THEM ANIMALS AND PLANTS WERE EVOLVED ALONG DIVERGENT LINES OF DESCENT
LJ026-0040 AND IN THIS CONNECTION THE FACT THAT SOME BACTERIA  THE SIMPLEST ORGANISMS KNOWN AND DEVOID OF CHLOROPHYLL
LJ026-0041 MAY FLOURISH IN SOLUTIONS WHOLLY DEVOID OF ORGANIC MATTER IS VERY SIGNIFICANT
LJ026-0042 THE LOWER PLANTS AND ANIMALS REFERRED TO ABOVE ARE SO FAR FROM EVERYDAY OBSERVATION
LJ026-0043 AND HENCE SO UNFAMILIAR THAT TO MOST PEOPLE THE COMPARISON MADE WILL MEAN LITTLE IN TERMS OF ORDINARY GREEN FLOWERING PLANTS AND COMMON VERTEBRATE ANIMALS
LJ026-0044 IN ORDER TO EMPHASIZE THE FUNDAMENTAL SIMILARITY OF ORGANIC FUNCTION IN HIGHER AND LOWER ANIMALS AND PLANTS LET US COMPARE ANY HIGHER PLANT
LJ026-0045 E.G. A BEAN PLANT WITH A HIGHER ANIMAL E.G. FROG OR EVEN MAN
LJ026-0046 IN EACH THE LIFE IS THE SUM TOTAL OF A SERIES OF DEFINITE PROCESSES  NUTRITION OR FOOD SUPPLY
LJ026-0047 CIRCULATION METABOLISM EXCRETION OXYGENATION PART OF RESPIRATION
LJ026-0048 MOVEMENT IRRITABILITY NERVOUS ACTIVITY AND REPRODUCTION
LJ026-0049 IN TURN THESE WILL BE COMPARED FOR THE ANIMAL AND THE PLANT
LJ026-0050 FOLLOWING IN PART THE COMPARISONS OF CERTAIN ANIMALS AND PLANTS BY SEDGWICK AND WILSON AND OTHERS
LJ026-0051 THESE COMPARISONS WILL HOWEVER BE TRANSLATED INTO TERMS APPLICABLE TO ANY SPECIES OF HIGHER PLANTS OR ANIMALS
LJ026-0052 IN THE NUTRITION OF THE ANIMAL THE MOST ESSENTIAL AND CHARACTERISTIC PART OF THE FOOD SUPPLY IS DERIVED FROM VEGETABLE
LJ026-0053 OR ANIMAL MATTER IN THE FORM OF VARIOUS ORGANIC COMPOUNDS OF WHICH THE MOST IMPORTANT ARE PROTEIDS PROTOPLASM ALBUMEN ETC
LJ026-0054 CARBOHYDRATES STARCH CELLULOSE AND FATS
LJ026-0055 THESE MATERIALS ARE USED BY THE ANIMAL IN THE MANUFACTURE OF NEW PROTOPLASM TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THAT WHICH HAS BEEN USED UP
LJ026-0056 IT IS HOWEVER IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE ANIMAL TO BUILD THESE MATERIALS DIRECTLY INTO THE SUBSTANCE OF ITS OWN BODY
LJ026-0057 THEY MUST FIRST UNDERGO CERTAIN PREPARATORY CHEMICAL CHANGES KNOWN COLLECTIVELY AS DIGESTION
LJ026-0058 AND ONLY AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THIS PROCESS CAN ALL THE FOOD BE ABSORBED INTO THE CIRCULATION
LJ026-0059 FOR THIS PURPOSE THE FOOD IS TAKEN NOT INTO THE BODY PROPER BUT INTO A KIND OF TUBULAR CHEMICAL LABORATORY CALLED THE ALIMENTARY CANAL
LJ026-0060 THROUGH WHICH IT SLOWLY PASSES BEING SUBJECTED MEANWHILE TO THE ACTION OF CERTAIN CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES OR REAGENTS KNOWN AS DIGESTIVE FERMENTS
LJ026-0061 THESE SUBSTANCES WHICH ARE DISSOLVED IN A WATERY LIQUID TO FORM THE DIGESTIVE FLUID ARE SECRETED BY THE WALLS OF THE ALIMENTARY TUBE
LJ026-0062 THROUGH THEIR ACTION THE SOLID PORTIONS ARE LIQUEFIED AND THE FOOD IS RENDERED CAPABLE OF ABSORPTION INTO THE BODY PROPER
LJ026-0063 THE FOOD SUPPLY OF THE HIGHER PLANT LIKE THAT OF THE ANIMAL IS THE SOURCE OF THE REQUIRED MATTER AND ENERGY
LJ026-0064 BUT UNLIKE THAT OF THE ANIMAL IT IS NOT CHIEFLY AN INCOME OF FOODS BUT ONLY OF THE RAW MATERIALS OF FOOD
LJ026-0065 MATTER ENTERS THE PLANT IN THE LIQUID OR GASEOUS FORM BY DIFFUSION
LJ026-0066 BOTH FROM THE SOIL THROUGH THE ROOTS LIQUIDS AND FROM THE ATMOSPHERE THROUGH THE LEAVES GASES
LJ026-0067 WE HAVE HERE THE DIRECT ABSORPTION INTO THE BODY PROPER OF FOODSTUFFS PRECISELY AS THE ANIMAL TAKES IN WATER AND OXYGEN
LJ026-0068 ENERGY ENTERS THE PLANT TO A SMALL EXTENT
LJ026-0069 AS THE POTENTIAL ENERGY OF FOODSTUFFS BUT COMES IN PRINCIPALLY AS THE KINETIC ENERGY OF SUNLIGHT ABSORBED IN THE LEAVES
LJ026-0070 OF THE SUBSTANCES THE SOLIDS SALTS ETC. MUST BE DISSOLVED IN WATER BEFORE THEY CAN BE TAKEN IN
LJ026-0071 WATER AND DISSOLVED SALTS CONTINUALLY PASS BY DIFFUSION FROM THE SOIL INTO THE ROOTS WHERE TOGETHER THEY CONSTITUTE THE SAP
LJ026-0072 THE SAP TRAVELS THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE PLANT THE MAIN THOUGH NOT THE ONLY CAUSE OF MOVEMENT
LJ026-0073 BEING THE CONSTANT TRANSPIRATION EVAPORATION OF WATERY VAPOR FROM THE LEAVES ESPECIALLY THROUGH THE STOMATA
LJ026-0074 THE GASEOUS MATTERS CARBON DIOXIDE OXYGEN NITROGEN ENTER THE PLANT MAINLY BY DIFFUSION FROM THE ATMOSPHERE
LJ026-0075 ARE DISSOLVED BY THE SAP IN THE LEAVES AND ELSEWHERE AND THUS MAY PASS TO EVERY PORTION OF THE PLANT
LJ026-0076 THE GREEN PLANT OWES ITS POWER OF ABSORBING THE ENERGY OF SUNLIGHT
LJ026-0077 TO THE CHLOROPHYLL BODIES OR CHROMATOPHORES FOR PLANTS WHICH LIKE FUNGI ETC. ARE DEVOID OF CHLOROPHYLL ARE UNABLE THUS TO ACQUIRE ENERGY
LJ026-0078 ENTERING THE CHLOROPHYLL BODIES THE KINETIC ENERGY OF SUNLIGHT IS APPLIED TO THE DECOMPOSITION OF CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER
LJ026-0079 AFTER PASSING THROUGH MANIFOLD BUT IMPERFECTLY KNOWN PROCESSES THE ELEMENTS OF THESE SUBSTANCES FINALLY REAPPEAR AS STARCH
LJ026-0080 OFTEN IN THE FORM OF GRANULES EMBEDDED IN THE CHLOROPHYLL BODIES AND FREE OXYGEN MOST OF WHICH IS RETURNED TO THE ATMOSPHERE
LJ026-0081 THUS THE LEAF OF A GREEN PLANT IN THE LIGHT IS CONTINUALLY ABSORBING CARBON DIOXIDE AND GIVING FORTH FREE OXYGEN
LJ026-0082 CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER CONTAIN NO POTENTIAL ENERGY SINCE THE AFFINITIES OF THEIR CONSTITUENT ELEMENTS ARE COMPLETELY SATISFIED
LJ026-0083 STARCH HOWEVER CONTAINS POTENTIAL ENERGY SINCE THE MOLECULE IS RELATIVELY UNSTABLE
LJ026-0084 I.E. CAPABLE OF DECOMPOSITION INTO SIMPLER STABLER MOLECULES IN WHICH STRONGER AFFINITIES ARE SATISFIED
LJ026-0085 AND THIS IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT IN THE MANUFACTURE OF STARCH IN THE CHLOROPHYLL BODIES
LJ026-0086 THE KINETIC ENERGY OF SUNLIGHT WAS EXPENDED IN LIFTING THE ATOMS INTO POSITION OF VANTAGE THUS ENDOWING THEM WITH ENERGY OF POSITION
LJ026-0087 IN THIS WAY SOME OF THE RADIANT AND KINETIC ENERGY OF THE SUN COMES TO BE STORED UP AS POTENTIAL ENERGY IN THE STARCH
LJ026-0088 IN SHORT THE GREEN PLANT IS ABLE BY COOPERATION WITH SUNLIGHT TO USE SIMPLE RAW MATERIALS CARBON DIOXIDE WATER OXYGEN ETC
LJ026-0089 POOR IN ENERGY OR DEVOID OF IT AND OUT OF THEM TO MANUFACTURE FOOD  I.E. COMPLEX COMPOUNDS RICH IN AVAILABLE POTENTIAL ENERGY
LJ026-0090 THIS POWER IS POSSESSED BY GREEN PLANTS ALONE ALL OTHER ORGANISMS BEING DEPENDENT FOR ENERGY UPON THE POTENTIAL ENERGY OF READYMADE FOOD
LJ026-0091 THIS MUST IN THE FIRST INSTANCE BE PROVIDED FOR THEM BY GREEN PLANTS AND HENCE WITHOUT CHLOROPHYLLBEARING PLANTS
LJ026-0092 ANIMALS AND COLORLESS PLANTS AS WELL APPARENTLY COULD NOT LONG EXIST
LJ026-0093 THE PLANT ABSORBS ALSO A SMALL AMOUNT OF KINETIC ENERGY INDEPENDENTLY OF THE SUNLIGHT IN THE FORM OF HEAT
LJ026-0094 THIS HOWEVER IS PROBABLY NOT A SOURCE OF VITAL ENERGY BUT ONLY CONTRIBUTES TO THE MAINTENANCE OF THE BODY TEMPERATURE
LJ026-0095 FOOD STARCH THUS PRODUCED IN THE GREEN LEAVES OF HIGHER PLANTS AND THE INORGANIC FOODS
LJ026-0096 WATER NITRITES OR NITRATES AND VARIOUS MINERAL SUBSTANCES IN SOLUTION IN WATER
LJ026-0097 FURNISH THE MATERIALS AND ENERGY REQUIRED FOR THE LIFE AND GROWTH OF THE PLANT
LJ026-0098 THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM DISTRIBUTES THESE FOODS. IN ANIMALS FOODS PREPARED FOR ABSORPTION IN THE STOMACH AND INTESTINE BY DIGESTION
LJ026-0099 ARE ABSORBED BY THE CIRCULATING LIQUIDS BLOOD AND LYMPH AND TRANSPORTED TO ALL CELLS OF THE ANIMAL BODY
LJ026-0100 IN THE PLANT THE INORGANIC MATTER IN WATER FROM THE SOIL ARE ABSORBED BY THE ROOTS AND CARRIED UP DEFINITE TUBES IN THE WOODY PART OF THE STEM
LJ026-0101 THE CAUSES OF THIS ASCENT ARE NOT CLEAR
LJ026-0102 BUT ROOT PRESSURE DUE TO OSMOSIS CAPILLARY ACTION AND EVAPORATION FROM THE LEAVES ARE FACTORS
LJ026-0103 JUST AS THE SOLID FOOD OF ANIMALS MUST BE DIGESTED IN PREPARATION FOR ABSORPTION
LJ026-0104 SO STARCH MANUFACTURED IN THE LEAVES MUST BE DIGESTED DISSOLVED BEFORE IT CAN BE TRANSPORTED
LJ026-0105 THIS IS DONE BY DIASTASE AN ENZYME OF PLANT CELLS
LJ026-0106 THE CHANGE IS FROM STARCH TO A SUGAR CAPABLE OF DIFFUSION
LJ026-0107 DISSOLVED IN WATER THE SUGAR IS TRANSPORTED DOWN DELICATE TUBES CHIEFLY IN THE GROWING BARK REGION OF THE STEM
LJ026-0108 IT IS CLEAR THAT THERE ARE UPWARD AND DOWNWARD CURRENTS OF WATER CONTAINING FOOD COMPARABLE TO BLOOD OF AN ANIMAL
LJ026-0109 BUT NO SYSTEM OF COMPLETE CIRCULATION AS IN THE BLOOD VESSELS OF A HIGHER ANIMAL
LJ026-0110 HOWEVER THE RESULT IN DISTRIBUTED FOOD IS THE SAME IN THE PLANT AND IN THE ANIMAL
LJ026-0111 IN THE CELLS THE FOODS UNDERGO METABOLIC CHANGES
LJ026-0112 IN AN ANIMAL THE FOODS IN THE CIRCULATING LIQUIDS BLOOD AND LYMPH ARE SELECTED AND ABSORBED BY THE CELLS
LJ026-0113 ONLY PROTEID FOODS FORM NEW PROTOPLASM
LJ026-0114 AND EVEN OF PROTEIDS ONLY A LIMITED AMOUNT 75 TO ONE HUNDRED GRAMS A DAY FOR A MAN IS BUILT INTO NEW PROTOPLASM
LJ026-0115 THE EXCESS UNDERGOES OXIDATION AND FORMS NITROGEN EXCRETIONS
LJ026-0116 THE FOODS CONTAINING ONLY THE ELEMENTS CARBON HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN FATS AND CARBOHYDRATES
LJ026-0117 ARE DIRECTLY OXIDIZED TO EXCRETIONS AND LACKING NITROGEN CANNOT SERVE FOR MAKING NEW ANIMAL PROTOPLASM
LJ026-0118 FAT AND CARBOHYDRATE FOODS THEN NEVER BECOME LIVING MATTER
LJ026-0119 THEY MAY BE STORED ESPECIALLY AS FAT UNTIL NEEDED FOR OXIDATION TO SUPPLY ENERGY
LJ026-0120 THE BUILDING UP OF THE PROTOPLASM FROM PROTEIDS IS ANABOLISM CONSTRUCTIVE METABOLISM
LJ026-0121 THE DESTRUCTION OF PROTOPLASM EXCESS PROTEIDS OR THE FAT AND CARBOHYDRATE FOODS IS CATABOLISM DESTRUCTIVE METABOLISM
LJ026-0122 CATABOLISM IS PROBABLY DUE TO ENZYME ACTION BUT THE FINAL RESULT IS CHIEFLY CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER
LJ026-0123 WHICH COULD BE DERIVED BY THE ORDINARY CHEMICAL EVOLUTION OF PROTOPLASM PROTEID SUGAR STARCH OR FATS
LJ026-0124 IN THE PLANT STARCH AS HAS BEEN SEEN IS FIRST FORMED IN THE CHLOROPHYLLBODIES
LJ026-0125 BUT THE FORMATION OF STARCH ALL IMPORTANT AS IT IS IS AFTER ALL ONLY THE MANUFACTURE OF FOOD
LJ026-0126 AS A PRELIMINARY TO THE REAL PROCESSES OF NUTRITION
LJ026-0127 THESE PROCESSES MUST TAKE PLACE EVERYWHERE IN ORDINARY PROTOPLASM
LJ026-0128 FOR IT IS HERE THAT OXIDATION OCCURS AND THE NEED FOR A RENEWAL OF MATTER AND ENERGY CONSEQUENTLY ARISES
LJ026-0129 SOONER OR LATER THE STARCH GRAINS ARE CHANGED INTO A KIND OF SUGAR GLUCOSE WHICH UNLIKE STARCH DISSOLVES IN THE SAP
LJ026-0130 AND MAY THUS BE EASILY TRANSPORTED TO ALL PARTS OF THE PLANT
LJ026-0131 WHEREVER THERE IS NEED FOR NEW PROTOPLASM WHETHER TO REPAIR PREVIOUS WASTE OR TO SUPPLY MATERIALS FOR GROWTH
LJ026-0132 AFTER ABSORPTION INTO THE CELLS THE ELEMENTS OF THE STARCH OR GLUCOSE ARE BY THE LIVING PROTOPLASM IN SOME UNKNOWN WAY
LJ026-0133 COMBINED WITH NITROGEN AND SULPHUR PROBABLY ALSO WITH SALTS WATER ETC. TO FORM PROTEID MATTER
LJ026-0134 THE PARTICLES OF THIS NEWLY FORMED COMPOUND ARE INCORPORATED INTO THE PROTOPLASM
LJ026-0135 IF A LARGER QUANTITY OF STARCH IS FORMED IN THE CHLOROPHYLL BODIES THAN IS IMMEDIATELY NEEDED BY THE PROTOPLASM FOR PURPOSES OF REPAIR OR GROWTH
LJ026-0136 IT MAY BE RECONVERTED INTO STARCH AFTER JOURNEYING AS GLUCOSE THROUGH THE PLANT
LJ026-0137 AND BE LAID DOWN AS RESERVE STARCH IN THE CELLS OF ROOT OR STEM OR ELSEWHERE
LJ026-0138 APPARENTLY WHEN THIS RESERVE SUPPLY IS FINALLY NEEDED AT ANY POINT IN THE PLANT IT IS AGAIN CHANGED TO GLUCOSE AND TRANSPORTED THITHER
LJ026-0139 IT IS PROBABLE THAT NEW LEAVES AND NEW TISSUES GENERALLY ARE ALWAYS FORMED IN PART FROM THIS RESERVE STARCH
LJ026-0140 IN THE PLANT AS IN THE ANIMAL METABOLISM MUST CONSIST OF ANABOLIC AND CATABOLIC PROCESSES
LJ026-0141 THE CONSTRUCTION IN THE CELLS OF NEW PROTEID FROM THE ABSORBED CARBOHYDRATE AND THE MATERIALS FROM THE SOIL IS TRUE ANABOLISM
LJ026-0142 IT IS ALSO CLEAR THAT CATABOLISM OR OXIDATION FOR THE LIBERATION OF ENERGY OCCURS AS IN ANIMALS BUT THIS PROCESS IS SLOWER
LJ026-0143 PROBABLY FOODS CONTAINING CARBON HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN ARE THE SOURCES OF ENERGY IN THE HIGHER PLANTS AS IN ANIMALS
LJ026-0144 IN BOTH PLANTS AND ANIMALS SIMPLE WASTE SUBSTANCES RESULT FROM THE CATABOLIC PROCESSES IN THE CELLS
LJ026-0145 IN THE ANIMAL CARBON DIOXIDE WATER AND NITROGEN COMPOUNDS ARE THE CHIEF EXCRETIONS
LJ026-0146 THEY ARE ABSORBED BY THE CIRCULATING LIQUIDS AND CARRIED TO THE ELIMINATING ORGANS LUNGS AND KIDNEYS CHIEFLY FOR ELIMINATION
LJ026-0147 IN THE HIGHER PLANTS THE EXCRETIONS ARE CARBON DIOXIDE WHICH ESCAPES THROUGH THE EPIDERMIS OF ROOT STEM AND LEAF AND THROUGH THE STOMATA
LJ026-0148 WATER WHICH IS LOST BY EVAPORATION ESPECIALLY FROM THE LEAF SURFACE THROUGH THE STOMATA
LJ026-0149 EXCRETIONS WHICH ARE LOST BY OSMOSIS THROUGH THE ROOTS AND THE ACCUMULATED BUT USELESS MINERAL SUBSTANCES WHICH ARE ELIMINATED BY LEAF FALL
LJ026-0150 IN BOTH ANIMALS AND PLANTS OXYGEN IS ESSENTIAL TO THE CATABOLIC PART OF METABOLISM
LJ026-0151 HENCE OXYGEN MUST BE SUPPLIED TO THE CELLS
LJ026-0152 OXYGENATION IS THE TERM USED TO DENOTE THE OXYGENSUPPLYING PART OF RESPIRATION
LJ026-0153 THE OTHER PART OF RESPIRATION ELIMINATION OF CARBON DIOXIDE HAS BEEN TREATED UNDER EXCRETIONS
LJ026-0154 IN THE ANIMAL OXYGEN IS ABSORBED BY THE BLOOD IN EXCESS BY THE HEMOGLOBIN OF THE RED CELLS OF THE BLOOD
LJ026-0155 AND LATER IS ABSORBED FROM THE BLOOD AND LYMPH BY ALL THE LIVING CELLS
LJ026-0156 IN THE PLANT ALSO OXYGEN IS ABSORBED THROUGH THE EPIDERMIS AND STOMATA FROM THE AIR
LJ026-0157 THIS PROCESS IS HOWEVER OBSCURED DURING THE DAY BECAUSE OF THE OXYGEN FREED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF STARCH WHICH GOES ON AT THAT TIME
LJ026-0158 PROBABLY THIS FREED OXYGEN IS USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF OXYGENATION BUT MORE IS FREED IN THE PHOTOSYNTHETIC PROCESS THAN IS NEEDED FOR OXYGENATION
LJ026-0159 AND HENCE THE EXCESS OXYGEN IS ELIMINATED WHILE STARCH MANUFACTURE IS IN PROCESS
LJ026-0160 IN COMPARING A HIGHER ANIMAL AND A GREEN PLANT CONFUSION MUST BE AVOIDED REGARDING THE PART PLAYED BY OXYGEN AND CARBON DIOXIDE IN TRUE RESPIRATION
LJ026-0161 WITH THE PART PLAYED BY THE SAME SUBSTANCES IN STARCH FORMATION PHOTOSYNTHESIS
LJ026-0162 IN NONGREEN PLANTS LIKE THE INDIAN PIPE AND MUSHROOMS THE BREATHING OF OXYGEN AND THE EXCRETION OF CARBON DIOXIDE ARE AS IN THE ANIMAL
LJ026-0163 THIS IS TRUE ALSO OF GREEN PLANTS IN DARKNESS AND EVEN IN THE LIGHT OF ALL PARTS OF GREEN PLANTS EXCEPT THE CHLOROPHYLLBODIES
LJ026-0164 THESE CONSTITUTE A SORT OF EXTRA MECHANISM ENABLING GREEN PLANTS TO MAKE THEIR OWN CARBOHYDRATE FOOD
LJ026-0165 IMAGINE A HIGHER ANIMAL WITH AN ATTACHMENT FOR TURNING THE CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER EXCRETED
LJ026-0166 BACK TO STARCH USABLE AS FOOD AND THE COMPARISON OF THE GREEN PLANT AND THE ANIMAL WOULD BE COMPLETE
LJ027-0001 THE SCIENCE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE VOLUME 5. EDITED BY FRANCIS ROLTWHEELER
LJ027-0002 BIOLOGY CHAPTER TEN MORPHOLOGY AND EMBRYOLOGY PART ONE
LJ027-0003 THE FACTS OF BIOLOGY WHICH ADMIT OF ADEQUATE EXPLANATION ONLY IN CONNECTION WITH THE THEORY OF DESCENT
LJ027-0004 ARE GROUPED BY ROMANES AND OTHER WRITERS ON ORGANIC EVOLUTION UNDER THE HEADS OF MORPHOLOGY EMBRYOLOGY CLASSIFICATION
LJ027-0005 PALEONTOLOGY DISTRIBUTION AND DOMESTICATION
LJ027-0006 IN ALL THESE LINES THE FACTS ARE DRAWN TOGETHER BY A STRONG THREAD OF UNITY
LJ027-0007 THERE ARE NUMBERLESS SIMILARITIES AND CORRELATIONS AND SURPRISING UNIFORMITIES
LJ027-0008 THE GREAT VARIETY OF LIFE AS EXHIBITED IN THE COUNTLESS SPECIES OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS HAS BEEN REFERRED TO AND YET GREAT AS THIS VARIETY IS
LJ027-0009 THERE ARE AFTER ALL ONLY A FEW TYPES OF STRUCTURE AMONG ALL ANIMALS AND PLANTS SOME THREE OR FOUR OR EIGHT OR TEN GENERAL MODES OF DEVELOPMENT
LJ027-0010 AND ALL THE REST ARE MODIFICATIONS FROM THESE FEW TYPES
LJ027-0011 IT IS MOREOVER TRUE THAT ALL LIVING FORMS ARE BUT SERIES OF MODIFICATIONS AND EXTENSIONS OF ONE SINGLE PLAN OF STRUCTURE
LJ027-0012 ALL HAVE THE SAME ULTIMATE SUBSTANCE
LJ027-0013 THE MYSTERIOUS SEMIFLUID NETWORK OF PROTOPLASM WHICH IS SO FAR AS IS KNOWN THE PHYSICAL BASIS OF ALL LIFE
LJ027-0014 AND THE EQUALLY MYSTERIOUS NUCLEAR SUBSTANCE OR CHROMATIN
LJ027-0015 WHICH IN SOME FASHION PRESIDES OVER ALL THE MOVEMENTS OF THE PROTOPLASM AND IS THE PHYSICAL BASIS OF THE PHENOMENA OF HEREDITY
LJ027-0016 THE SAME LAWS OF HEREDITY VARIABILITY AND OF RESPONSE TO OUTSIDE STIMULUS HOLD IN ALL PARTS OF THE ORGANIC WORLD
LJ027-0017 ALL ORGANISMS HAVE THE SAME NEED OF REPRODUCTION
LJ027-0018 ALL ARE FORCED TO MAKE CONCESSION AFTER CONCESSION TO THEIR SURROUNDINGS AND IN THESE CONCESSIONS ALL PROGRESS IN LIFE CONSISTS
LJ027-0019 AND AT LAST EACH ORGANISM OR EACH ALLIANCE OF ORGANISMS MUST COME TO THE GREATEST CONCESSION OF ALL WHICH IS CALLED DEATH
LJ027-0020 THE UNITY IN LIFE THEN IS NOT LESS A FACT THAN IS LIFE'S GREAT DIVERSITY
LJ027-0021 WHATEVER EMPHASIS IS LAID UPON THE DIVERSITY OF LIFE THE ESSENTIAL UNITY OF ALL ORGANISMS MUST NOT BE FORGOTTEN
LJ027-0022 AN EXAMINATION OF THE FACTS IN EACH OF THE LINES OF EVIDENCE MAKES IT CLEAR
LJ027-0023 THAT THE ONLY REASONABLE EXPLANATION FOR THE EXISTENCE OF A FUNDAMENTAL UNITY IN ORGANIC LIFE
LJ027-0024 IS THE THEORY OF DESCENT  I.E. THAT SIMILARITIES ARE DUE TO BLOOD RELATIONSHIP AND THAT DIFFERENCES COME FROM ADAPTIVE MODIFICATIONS
LJ027-0025 THE FACTS ADDUCED FROM MORPHOLOGY BEING THE RESULT OF RESEARCHES INTO THE STRUCTURE OF ADULT ANIMALS AND PLANTS
LJ027-0026 LEAD TO A PREVIEW OF CERTAIN PRINCIPLES OF ADAPTATION NECESSARY FOR THEIR INTERPRETATION
LJ027-0027 FIRST IT MUST BE NOTED THAT SOME STRUCTURES ARE NOT NONADAPTIVE THAT IS DO NOT CHANGE TO FIT CHANGED HABITS OR CONDITIONS OF LIFE
LJ027-0028 SUCH STRUCTURES OR ORGANS ARE MOST OFTEN FOUND INTERNALLY
LJ027-0029 FOR ILLUSTRATION A CHANGE IN THE LOCOMOTIVE HABIT OF A BIRD FROM THAT OF FLYING TO THAT OF AN OSTRICH
LJ027-0030 IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN ADAPTIVE MODIFICATION OF LOCOMOTOR STRUCTURES LEGS AND WINGS
LJ027-0031 BUT NOT IN ANY STRIKING WAY IS THERE CHANGE IN THE INTERNAL ORGANS
LJ027-0032 INTERNAL ORGANS MAY PERSIST UNCHANGED AND HENCE THEY OFFER GOOD GUIDES TO CLASSIFICATION
LJ027-0033 ON THE OTHER HAND EXTERNAL STRUCTURES ARE LIKELY TO UNDERGO ADAPTATION WHEN HABITS OR CONDITIONS OF LIFE CHANGE
LJ027-0034 HENCE AS JORDAN HAS SAID THE INSIDE OF AN ANIMAL TELLS THE REAL HISTORY OF ITS ANCESTRY THE OUTSIDE TELLS US ONLY WHERE ITS ANCESTORS HAVE BEEN
LJ027-0035 IN THE SECOND PLACE IT MUST BE NOTED THAT ADAPTATIONS TO SIMILAR CONDITIONS MAY RESULT IN SUPERFICIAL RESEMBLANCES
LJ027-0036 FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS A SUPERFICIAL RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN THE WING OF AN INSECT AND THE WING OF A BIRD
LJ027-0037 BOTH ADAPTATIONS TO AN AERIAL ENVIRONMENT
LJ027-0038 BETWEEN THE HEART OF AN INSECT AND THE HEART OF A VERTEBRATE ANIMAL
LJ027-0039 BOTH ADAPTATIONS FOR PUMPING BLOOD
LJ027-0040 BETWEEN THE FIN OF A FISH AND THE PADDLE OF A WHALE
LJ027-0041 BOTH ADAPTIVE SWIMMING ORGANS YET THE RESEMBLANCE IN THESE CASES DOES NOT GO DEEPER THAN THE SURFACE  IT IS ONE OF FUNCTION ONLY
LJ027-0042 ALL SUCH CASES OF RESEMBLANCE IN FUNCTION BUT NOT IN DETAILED PLAN OF STRUCTURE ARE CALLED ANALOGIES
LJ027-0043 AND MEAN NOTHING MORE THAN SIMILARITY OF ENVIRONMENT
LJ027-0044 TURNING TO MORE FUNDAMENTAL RESEMBLANCES SUCH AS THE WING OF A BAT AND THE WING OF A BIRD
LJ027-0045 CAREFUL STUDY SHOWS DETAILED INTERNAL AS WELL AS EXTERNAL SIMILARITIES OF STRUCTURE. SUCH CASES ARE HOMOLOGIES
LJ027-0046 ON THE ONE HAND THEN ARE FOUND STRUCTURES WHICH ARE PERFECTLY ANALOGOUS AND YET IN NO WAY HOMOLOGOUS
LJ027-0047 TOTALLY DIFFERENT STRUCTURES ARE MODIFIED TO PERFORM THE SAME FUNCTIONS
LJ027-0048 ON THE OTHER HAND ARE FOUND STRUCTURES WHICH ARE PERFECTLY HOMOLOGOUS AND YET IN NO WAY ANALOGOUS
LJ027-0049 THE STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS REMAIN BUT ARE PROFOUNDLY MODIFIED TO PERFORM TOTALLY DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS
LJ027-0050 HOMOLOGY THUS MEANS IDENTITY OF STRUCTURE WHICH IS THE RESULT OF IDENTITY OF PARENTAGE. IT IS THE STAMP OF HEREDITY
LJ027-0051 IT MEANS BLOOD RELATIONSHIP
LJ027-0052 THESE PRINCIPLES OF HOMOLOGY ARE ESSENTIAL TO A CORRECT INTERPRETATION OF THE FACTS OF MORPHOLOGY
LJ027-0053 THE MOST STRIKING FACT OF SIMILAR STRUCTURE AMONG PLANTS AND AMONG ANIMALS IS THE EXISTENCE OF A COMMON GENERAL PLAN IN ANY GROUP
LJ027-0054 SINCE BACKBONED ANIMALS ARE BEST KNOWN TO MOST READERS THEY MAY BE TAKEN AS AN ILLUSTRATION
LJ027-0055 ALL VERTEBRATE ANIMALS AND NONE OTHER SAYS LE CONTE HAVE AN INTERNAL JOINTED SKELETON WORKED BY MUSCLES ON THE OUTSIDE
LJ027-0056 THE RELATION OF SKELETON AND MUSCLE IN ARTHROPODS IS EXACTLY THE REVERSE
LJ027-0057 IN ALL VERTEBRATES AND IN NONE OTHER THE AXIS OF THIS SKELETON IS A JOINTED BACKBONE VERTEBRAL COLUMN
LJ027-0058 ENCLOSING AND PROTECTING THE NERVOUS CENTERS CEREBROSPINAL AXIS
LJ027-0059 THESE THEREFORE MAY WELL BE CALLED BACKBONED ANIMALS
LJ027-0060 ALL VERTEBRATES AND NONE OTHER HAVE A NUMBER OF THEIR ANTERIOR VERTEBRAL JOINTS ENLARGED AND CONSOLIDATED INTO A BOX TO FORM THE SKULL
LJ027-0061 IN ORDER TO ENCLOSE AND PROTECT A SIMILAR ENLARGEMENT OF THE NERVOUS CENTER
LJ027-0062 VIZ. THE BRAIN AND ALSO USUALLY BUT NOT ALWAYS A NUMBER OF POSTERIOR JOINTS
LJ027-0063 ENLARGED AND CONSOLIDATED TO FORM THE PELVIS TO SERVE AS A FIRM SUPPORT TO THE HINDLIMBS
LJ027-0064 ALL VERTEBRATES AND NONE OTHER HAVE TWO CAVITIES
LJ027-0065 ENCLOSED AND PROTECTED BY THE SKELETON VIZ. THE NEURAL CAVITY ABOVE AND THE VISCERAL OR BODY CAVITY BELOW THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN
LJ027-0066 ALL VERTEBRATES WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS AND NO OTHER ANIMALS HAVE TWO AND ONLY TWO PAIR OF LIMBS
LJ027-0067 THE EXCEPTIONS ARE OF TWO KINDS VIZ. A SOME LOWEST FISHES AMPHIOXUS AND LAMPREYS
LJ027-0068 WHICH PROBABLY REPRESENT THE VERTEBRATE CONDITION BEFORE LIMBS WERE ACQUIRED
LJ027-0069 AND B DEGENERATE FORMS LIKE SNAKES AND SOME LIZARDS WHICH HAVE LOST THEIR LIMBS BY DISUSE
LJ027-0070 SO MUCH CONCERNS THE GENERAL PLAN OF SKELETAL STRUCTURES AND IS STRONGLY SUGGESTIVE OF  IN FACT IT IS INEXPLICABLE WITHOUT  COMMON ORIGIN
LJ027-0071 BUT MUCH MORE REMAINS WHICH IS NOT ONLY SUGGESTIVE BUT DEMONSTRATIVE OF SUCH ORIGIN
LJ027-0072 BY EXTENSIVE COMPARISON IN THE TAXONOMIC AND ONTOGENIC SERIES THE WHOLE VERTEBRATE STRUCTURE IN ALL ITS DETAILS IN DIFFERENT ANIMALS
LJ027-0073 MAY BE SHOWN TO BE MODIFICATIONS ONE OF ANOTHER
LJ027-0074 SOMETIMES A PIECE IS ENLARGED SOMETIMES DIMINISHED OR EVEN BECOMES OBSOLETE SOMETIMES SEVERAL PIECES ARE CONSOLIDATED INTO ONE
LJ027-0075 BUT IN SPITE OF ALL THESE OBSCURATIONS CORRESPONDING PARTS USUALLY MAY BE MADE OUT
LJ027-0076 THESE REMARKABLE SIMILARITIES IN THE COMMON GENERAL PLAN ALONE ARE CONVINCING EVIDENCES OF DESCENT
LJ027-0077 BUT ATTENTION MAY BE CALLED TO A LIKE SIMILARITY EXTENDING TO THE DETAILS OF STRUCTURE
LJ027-0078 FOR EXAMPLE THE WINGS OF A BAT A MAMMAL A BIRD AND A FOSSIL FLYING REPTILE ALL SHOW THE SAME BONES ADAPTIVELY MODIFIED
LJ027-0079 A SERIES OF EITHER FORE OR HIND LIMBS OF A MAMMAL WITH ONE TOE HORSE
LJ027-0080 TWO TOES SHEEP FOUR TOES HOG AND FIVE TOES DOG
LJ027-0081 EXHIBIT A REMARKABLE SERIES OF HOMOLOGIES POINTING TO A FIVETOED ANCESTOR
LJ027-0082 AND ANY OTHER SERIES OF ORGANS OF VERTEBRATES WOULD GIVE THE SAME EVIDENCE OF FUNDAMENTAL RESEMBLANCES HOMOLOGIES
LJ027-0083 FOR SUCH A SERIES OF FACTS THE READER MUST BE REFERRED TO SPECIAL BOOKS LIKE WIEDERSHEIM'S COMPARATIVE ANATOMY OF THE VERTEBRATES
LJ027-0084 ROMANES'S DARWIN AND AFTER DARWIN AND LE CONTE'S EVOLUTION
LJ027-0085 THE EXISTENCE OF GREAT SIMILARITIES IN VERTEBRATE STRUCTURE IS NOT ALWAYS FULLY RECOGNIZED
LJ027-0086 TO THE SUPERFICIAL OBSERVER THE BODIES OF ANIMALS OF DIFFERENT CLASSES SEEM TO DIFFER FUNDAMENTALLY IN PLAN
LJ027-0087 TO BE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT MACHINES MADE EACH FOR ITS OWN PURPOSES AT ONCE OUT OF HAND
LJ027-0088 EXTENSIVE COMPARISON ON THE CONTRARY SHOWS THEM TO BE THE SAME ALTHOUGH THE ESSENTIAL IDENTITY IS OBSCURED BY ADAPTIVE MODIFICATIONS
LJ027-0089 THE SIMPLEST IN FACT THE ONLY SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION OF THE PHENOMENA OF VERTEBRATE STRUCTURE IS THE IDEA OF A PRIMAL VERTEBRATE
LJ027-0090 MODIFIED MORE AND MORE THROUGH SUCCESSIVE GENERATIONS BY THE NECESSITIES OF DIFFERENT MODES OF LIFE
LJ027-0091 SEE THEN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MAN'S MODE OF WORKING AND NATURE'S
LJ027-0092 A MAN HAVING MADE A STEAMENGINE AND DESIRING TO USE IT FOR A DIFFERENT PURPOSE FROM THAT FOR WHICH IT WAS FIRST DESIGNED AND USED
LJ027-0093 WILL NEARLY ALWAYS BE COMPELLED TO ADD NEW PARTS NOT CONTEMPLATED IN THE ORIGINAL MACHINE
LJ027-0094 NATURE RARELY MAKES NEW PARTS  NEVER IF SHE CAN AVOID IT  BUT ON THE CONTRARY ADAPTS AN OLD PART TO THE NEW FUNCTION
LJ027-0095 IT IS AS IF NATURE WERE NOT FREE TO USE ANY AND EVERY DEVICE TO ACCOMPLISH HER END BUT WERE CONDITIONED BY HER OWN PLANS OF STRUCTURE
LJ027-0096 AS INDEED SHE MUST BE ACCORDING TO THE DERIVATION THEORY
LJ027-0097 THUS IN THE FIN OF A FISH THE FOREPAW OF A REPTILE OR A MAMMAL THE WING OF A BIRD AND THE ARM AND HAND OF A MAN
LJ027-0098 IS FOUND THE SAME PART VARIOUSLY MODIFIED FOR MANY PURPOSES
LJ027-0099 ANOTHER STRIKING CLASS OF THE FACTS OF MORPHOLOGY WHICH ADMIT OF SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION ONLY ALONG THE LINE OF HOMOLOGY
LJ027-0100 ARE THE THOUSANDS OF CASES OF RUDIMENTARY OR VESTIGIAL STRUCTURES TO BE FOUND
LJ027-0101 THROUGHOUT BOTH THE ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE KINGDOMS DWARFED AND USELESS REPRESENTATIVES OF ORGANS ARE CONSTANTLY MET WITH
LJ027-0102 WHICH IN OTHER AND ALLIED KINDS OF ANIMALS AND PLANTS ARE OF LARGE SIZE AND FUNCTIONAL UTILITY
LJ027-0103 THUS FOR INSTANCE THE UNBORN WHALE HAS RUDIMENTARY TEETH
LJ027-0104 WHICH ARE NEVER DESTINED TO CUT THE GUMS AND THROUGHOUT ITS LIFE THIS ANIMAL RETAINS IN A SIMILARLY RUDIMENTARY CONDITION
LJ027-0105 A NUMBER OF ORGANS WHICH NEVER COULD HAVE BEEN OF USE TO ANY KIND OF CREATURE SAVE A TERRESTRIAL QUADRUPED
LJ027-0106 OTHER WELLKNOWN EXAMPLES AMONG VERTEBRATES ARE VESTIGES OF HIND LIMBS IN CERTAIN SNAKES REDUCED WINGS IN THE APTERYX AND OSTRICHES
LJ027-0107 RUDIMENTS OF EYES IN CAVE FISHES HIND LIMBS BENEATH THE SKIN OF WHALES THE VERMIFORM APPENDIX IN MAN
LJ027-0108 AS WELL AS USELESS MUSCLES TO MOVE THE EARS AND THE SKIN AND ALSO A VERY MUCH REDUCED HAIRY COVERING OVER THE SURFACE OF THE BODY
LJ027-0109 WIEDERSHEIM HAS RECORDED MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SUCH STRUCTURAL REMINISCENCES IN MAN
LJ027-0110 NOW RUDIMENTARY ORGANS OF THIS KIND ARE OF SUCH FREQUENT OCCURRENCE THAT ALMOST EVERY SPECIES OF ORGANISM PRESENTS ONE OR MORE OF THEM
LJ027-0111 USUALLY INDEED A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER
LJ027-0112 HOW THEN ARE THEY TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR
LJ027-0113 OF COURSE THE THEORY OF DESCENT WITH ADAPTIVE MODIFICATION HAS A SIMPLE ANSWER TO SUPPLY
LJ027-0114 NAMELY THAT WHEN FROM CHANGED CONDITIONS OF LIFE AN ORGAN WHICH WAS PREVIOUSLY USEFUL BECOMES USELESS
LJ027-0115 IT WILL BE SUFFERED TO DWINDLE AWAY IN SUCCESSIVE GENERATIONS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CERTAIN NATURAL CAUSES
LJ027-0116 ON THE OTHER HAND THE THEORY OF SPECIAL CREATION CAN ONLY MAINTAIN THAT THESE RUDIMENTS ARE FORMED FOR THE SAKE OF ADHERING TO AN IDEAL TYPE
LJ027-0117 NOW HERE AGAIN THE FORMER THEORY APPEARS TO BE TRIUMPHANT OVER THE LATTER SAYS ROMANES
LJ027-0118 FOR WITHOUT WAITING TO DISPUTE THE WISDOM OF MAKING DWARFED AND USELESS STRUCTURES MERELY FOR THE WHIMSICAL MOTIVE ASSIGNED
LJ027-0119 SURELY IF SUCH A METHOD WERE ADOPTED IN SO MANY CASES WE SHOULD EXPECT THAT IN CONSISTENCY IT WOULD BE ADOPTED IN ALL CASES
LJ027-0120 THIS REASONABLE EXPECTATION HOWEVER IS FAR FROM BEING REALIZED
LJ027-0121 IN NUMBERLESS CASES SUCH AS THAT OF THE FORELIMBS OF SERPENTS NO VESTIGE OF A RUDIMENT IS PRESENT
LJ027-0122 BUT THE VACILLATING POLICY IN THE MATTER OF RUDIMENTS DOES NOT END HERE FOR IT IS SHOWN IN A STILL MORE AGGRAVATED FORM
LJ027-0123 WHERE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE SAME NATURAL GROUP OF ORGANISMS A RUDIMENT IS SOMETIMES PRESENT AND SOMETIMES ABSENT
LJ027-0124 FOR INSTANCE ALTHOUGH IN NEARLY ALL THE NUMEROUS SPECIES OF SNAKES THERE ARE NO VESTIGES OF LIMBS
LJ027-0125 IN THE PYTHON WE FIND VERY TINY RUDIMENTS OF THE HINDLIMBS. NOW
LJ027-0126 IS IT A WORTHY CONCEPTION OF DEITY THAT
LJ027-0127 WHILE NEGLECTING TO MAINTAIN HIS UNITY OF IDEAL IN THE CASE OF NEARLY ALL THE NUMEROUS SPECIES OF SNAKES HE SHOULD HAVE ADDED A TINY RUDIMENT IN THE CASE OF THE PYTHON
LJ027-0128 AND EVEN IN THAT CASE SHOULD HAVE MAINTAINED HIS IDEAL VERY INEFFICIENTLY INASMUCH AS ONLY TWO LIMBS INSTEAD OF FOUR ARE REPRESENTED
LJ027-0129 CONVINCING AS ARE THE EVIDENCES OF DESCENT RECORDED IN THE STRUCTURE OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS
LJ027-0130 THESE EVIDENCES HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST THIRTY YEARS SOMEWHAT OVERSHADOWED BY THE FAR MORE SURPRISING EVIDENCES
LJ027-0131 OF DESCENT DISCOVERED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF PLANT AND ANIMAL EMBRYOS
LJ027-0132 A DOZEN VOLUMES WOULD BE NECESSARY
LJ027-0133 TO PRESENT THE MASS OF EMBRYOLOGICAL EVIDENCE BUT A FEW SALIENT FACTS WILL ILLUSTRATE THE KIND OF EVIDENCE TO BE DEDUCED FROM EMBRYOLOGY
LJ027-0134 MOST REMARKABLE OF ALL THE PRINCIPLES WHICH HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED BY EMBRYOLOGISTS IS THE RECAPITULATION DOCTRINE
LJ027-0135 WHICH BRIEFLY STATED IS THAT INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT ONTOGENY RECAPITULATES ANCESTRAL HISTORY PHYLOGENY
LJ027-0136 ILLUSTRATIONS QUOTED FROM THE WORKS OF ROMANES AND LE CONTE WILL MAKE THIS PRINCIPLE CLEAR
LJ027-0137 IT IS AN OBSERVABLE FACT SAYS ROMANES
LJ027-0138 THAT THERE IS OFTEN A CLOSE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN DEVELOPMENTAL CHANGES AS REVEALED BY ANY CHRONOLOGICAL SERIES OF FOSSILS WHICH MAY HAPPEN TO HAVE BEEN PRESERVED
LJ027-0139 AND DEVELOPMENTAL CHANGES WHICH MAY BE OBSERVED DURING THE LIFE HISTORY OF NOW EXISTING INDIVIDUALS BELONGING TO THE SAME GROUP OF ANIMALS
LJ027-0141 IS CLOSELY REPRODUCED IN THE LIFEHISTORY OF EXISTING DEER. OR IN OTHER WORDS
LJ027-0142 THE ANTLERS OF AN EXISTING DEER FURNISH IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT A KIND OF RESUME OR RECAPITULATION OF THE SUCCESSIVE PHASES
LJ027-0143 WHEREBY THE PRIMITIVE HORN WAS GRADUALLY SUPERSEDED BY HORNS PRESENTING A GREATER AND GREATER NUMBER OF PRONGS IN SUCCESSIVE SPECIES OF EXTINCT DEER
LJ027-0144 NOW IT MUST BE OBVIOUS
LJ027-0145 THAT SUCH A RECAPITULATION IN THE LIFE HISTORY OF AN EXISTING ANIMAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL CHANGES SUCCESSIVELY DISTINCTIVE OF SUNDRY ALLIED
LJ027-0146 THOUGH NOW EXTINCT SPECIES SPEAKS STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF EVOLUTION
LJ027-0147 FOR AS IT IS OF THE ESSENCE OF THIS THEORY THAT NEW FORMS ARISE FROM OLDER FORMS BY WAY OF HEREDITARY DESCENT
LJ027-0148 WE SHOULD ANTECEDENTLY EXPECT IF THE THEORY IS TRUE
LJ027-0149 THAT THE PHASES OF DEVELOPMENT PRESENTED BY THE INDIVIDUAL ORGANISM WOULD FOLLOW IN THEIR MAIN OUTLINES THOSE PHASES OF DEVELOPMENT
LJ027-0150 THROUGH WHICH THEIR LONG LINE OF ANCESTORS HAD PASSED
LJ027-0151 THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE VIEW IS THAT AS SPECIES OF DEER
LJ027-0152 FOR INSTANCE WERE SEPARATELY CREATED ADDITIONAL PRONGS WERE SUCCESSIVELY ADDED TO THEIR ANTLERS AND YET THAT
LJ027-0153 IN ORDER TO BE SO ADDED TO SUCCESSIVE SPECIES EVERY INDIVIDUAL DEER BELONGING TO LATER SPECIES WAS REQUIRED TO REPEAT IN HIS OWN LIFETIME
LJ027-0154 THE PROCESS OF SUCCESSIVE ADDITIONS WHICH HAD PREVIOUSLY TAKEN PLACE IN A REMOTE SERIES OF EXTINCT SPECIES
LJ027-0155 NOW I DO NOT DENY THAT THIS VIEW IS A POSSIBLE VIEW BUT I DO DENY THAT IT IS A PROBABLE ONE
LJ027-0156 ACCORDING TO THE EVOLUTIONARY INTERPRETATION OF SUCH FACTS WE CAN SEE A VERY GOOD REASON WHY THE LIFEHISTORY OF THE INDIVIDUAL
LJ027-0157 IS THUS A CONDENSED RESUME OF THE LIFE HISTORY OF ITS ANCESTRAL SPECIES
LJ027-0158 BUT ACCORDING TO THE OPPOSITE VIEW NO REASON CAN BE ASSIGNED WHY SUCH SHOULD BE THE CASE
LJ027-0159 IT IS WELL KNOWN LIKEWISE COMMENTS LE CONTE
LJ027-0160 THAT THE EMBRYO OR LARVA OF A FROG OR TOAD WHEN FIRST HATCHED IS A LEGLESS TAILSWIMMING WATERBREATHING GILLBREATHING ANIMAL
LJ027-0161 IT IS ESSENTIALLY A FISH AND WOULD BE SO CLASSED IF IT REMAINED IN THIS CONDITION
LJ027-0162 THE FISH RETAINS PERMANENTLY THIS FORM BUT THE FROG PASSES ON
LJ027-0163 NEXT IT FORMS FIRST ONE PAIR AND THEN ANOTHER PAIR OF LEGS AND MEANWHILE IT BEGINS TO BREATHE ALSO BY LUNGS
LJ027-0164 AT THIS STAGE IT BREATHES EQUALLY BY LUNGS AND BY GILLS  I.E. BOTH AIR AND WATER
LJ027-0165 NOW THE LOWER FORMS OF AMPHIBIANS SUCH AS SIREDON MENOBRANCHUS SIREN ETC
LJ027-0166 RETAIN PERMANENTLY THIS FORM AND ARE THEREFORE CALLED PERENNIBRANCHS BUT THE FROG STILL PASSES ON
LJ027-0167 THEN THE GILLS GRADUALLY DRY UP AS THE LUNGS DEVELOP AND THEY NOW BREATHE WHOLLY BY LUNGS BUT STILL RETAIN THE TAIL
LJ027-0168 NOW THIS IS THE PERMANENT MATURE CONDITION OF MANY AMPHIBIANS
LJ027-0169 SUCH AS THE TRITON THE SALAMANDER ETC. WHICH ARE THEREFORE CALLED CADUCIBRANCHS BUT THE FROG STILL PASSES ON
LJ027-0170 FINALLY IT LOSES THE TAIL OR RATHER ITS TAIL IS ABSORBED AND ITS MATERIAL USED IN FURTHER DEVELOPMENT AND IT BECOMES A PERFECT FROG
LJ027-0171 THE HIGHEST ORDER ANOURA OF THIS CLASS. THUS THEN IN ONTOGENY THE FISH GOES NO FURTHER THAN THE FISH STAGES
LJ027-0172 THE PERENNIBRANCH PASSES THROUGH THE FISH STAGE TO THE PERENNIBRANCH AMPHIBIAN
LJ027-0173 THE CADUCIBRANCH TAKES FIRST THE FISH FORM THEN THE PERENNIBRANCH FORM AND FINALLY THE CADUCIBRANCH FORM BUT GOES NO FURTHER
LJ027-0174 LAST THE ANOURA TAKES FIRST THE FISHFORM THEN THAT OF THE PERENNIBRANCH THEN THAT OF THE CADUCIBRANCH AND FINALLY BECOMES ANOURA
LJ027-0175 NOW THIS IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE ORDER OF SUCCESSION OF FORMS IN GEOLOGICAL TIMES  I.E. IN THE PHYLOGENIC SERIES
LJ027-0176 FISHES FIRST APPEARED IN THE DEVONIAN AND UPPER SILURIAN IN VERY REPTILIAN OR RATHER AMPHIBIAN FORMS
LJ027-0177 THEN IN THE CARBONIFEROUS FISHES STILL CONTINUING THERE APPEARED THE LOWEST  I.E. MOST FISHLIKE FORMS OF AMPHIBIANS
LJ027-0178 THESE WERE UNDOUBTEDLY PERENNIBRANCHS. IN THE PERMIAN AND TRIASSIC HIGHER FORMS APPEARED WHICH WERE CERTAINLY CADUCIBRANCH
LJ027-0179 FINALLY ONLY IN THE TERTIARY SO FAR AS WE YET KNOW DO THE HIGHEST FORM ANOURA APPEAR
LJ027-0180 THE GENERAL SIMILARITY OF THE THREE SERIES IS COMPLETE

LJ028-0002 IN THE OLD CITY OF DAMASCUS YOU CLIMB TO THE HUMP OF A TALL FLEET DROMEDARY
LJ028-0003 WITH GUIDES AND GUARDS ABOUT YOU YOU RIDE THROUGH THE COVERED BAZAARS CROWDED WITH DARKFACED ARABS IN STRANGE COSTUMES
LJ028-0004 AND ALONG THE NARROW WINDING LANE WHICH WAS ONCE CALLED THE STREET CALLED STRAIGHT
LJ028-0005 LEAVING THE CITY BY THE EASTERN GATE AND PASSING A SMALL VILLAGE OR TWO
LJ028-0006 YOU ASCEND THE HILL TO THE PLATEAU AND BEFORE YOU AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN REACH STRETCHES THE GREAT ARABIAN DESERT
LJ028-0007 WITH MINGLING FEAR AND WONDER AT THE MYSTERY ALWAYS LYING BEYOND THE DESERT HORIZON
LJ028-0008 YOU TAP GENTLY WITH YOUR HEEL UPON THE SHOULDER OF THE DROMEDARY TO URGE HER ON
LJ028-0009 AT FIRST PAYING LITTLE HEED TO YOU SHE HESITATES AND GLANCES ANXIOUSLY ABOUT THE DESERT AS IF IN SEARCH OF AN ENEMY
LJ028-0010 NOW AND THEN SHE REACHES DOWN TO GRAZE THE THORNY ARGOOL ALONG THE WAY
LJ028-0011 AS THE TAPS UPON HER SHOULDER ARE REPEATED SHE STRETCHES OUT HER LONG NECK AND WITH LONG STRIDES MAKES FOR THE EASTERN HORIZON
LJ028-0012 SHE REALIZES THAT SHE IS BOUND ON THE LONG JOURNEY ACROSS THE DESERT. HOUR AFTER HOUR SHE BEARS YOU OVER THE HARD MONOTONOUS PLAIN
LJ028-0013 THE DAMASCUS MOSQUES AND THEIR MINARETS SINK BENEATH THE WESTERN SKY
LJ028-0014 THE DESERT ABOUT YOU SHOWS NO SIGNS OF LIFE
LJ028-0015 ONLY A TALL COLUMN OF WHIRLING SAND REARING ITS HEAD UNTIL IT IS LOST IN THE BLUE ABOVE MOVES MAJESTICALLY ALONG
LJ028-0016 IN THE DISTANCE YOUR EYES DETECT A BEAUTIFUL LAKE WITH SHORES FRINGED WITH TREES
LJ028-0017 BUT SOON THE PHANTOM LAKE VANISHES WHILE OTHERS STILL FARTHER BEYOND APPEAR AND VANISH IN RAPID SUCCESSION
LJ028-0018 LIKE A GREAT BALL OF FIRE THE SUN SINKS IN THE WEST
LJ028-0019 THE STARS COME OUT ONE BY ONE AND SHINE BRIGHTER THAN ELSEWHERE AS IF TO LIGHT YOU ON YOUR WAY
LJ028-0020 LATE AT NIGHT THE WEARY DROMEDARY KNEELS AND ON THE GROUND CLOSE BESIDE HER YOU LIE DOWN TO SLEEP
LJ028-0021 AGAIN LONG BEFORE THE STARS HAVE BEEN SCATTERED BY THE MORNING SUN YOU ARE ON YOUR WAY
LJ028-0022 DAY AFTER DAY YOU TRAVEL ON SCORCHED BY THE HEAT OF NOONDAY SHIVERING IN THE CHILL WINDS OF THE NIGHT
LJ028-0023 TWO WEEKS PASS AND AT LAST YOU STAND ON THE EASTERN EDGE OF THE PLATEAU
LJ028-0024 GAZING DOWN UPON THE GREAT EUPHRATES WINDING ALONG THE VALLEY BENEATH
LJ028-0025 YOU HAVE CROSSED THE ARABIAN DESERT THE FIRST STAGE OF THE LONG JOURNEY TO THE WALLS OF BABYLON
LJ028-0026 HERE IN THE VALLEY THE WATER IS SWEET AND THE FOOD ABUNDANT
LJ028-0027 FOR TEN DAYS YOU FOLLOW DOWN THE RIVER THROUGH LITTLE VILLAGES AND BLACK TENT ENCAMPMENTS AMONG SCENES OF STRANGE ARAB LIFE WHICH NEVER LOSE THEIR CHARM
LJ028-0028 EVERYWHERE THE VALLEY IS DOTTED WITH THE MOUNDS OF BURIED CITIES CAREFULLY GUARDING THE SECRETS OF THE CENTURIES OF LONG AGO
LJ028-0029 AT LAST YOU SEE BEFORE YOU A MOUND RISING LIKE A MOUNTAIN FROM THE LEVEL PLAIN
LJ028-0030 YOUR JOURNEY IS AT AN END. BEFORE YOU IS BABYLON THE GATE OF GOD AS THE OLD NAME MEANS
LJ028-0031 ABOUT YOU IS ALL THAT REMAINS OF THE SECOND OF THE SEVEN WONDERS OF THE WORLD
LJ028-0032 BABYLON EVEN IN THE DAYS OF NEBUCHADNEZZAR WAS AN OLD OLD CITY
LJ028-0033 THERE IS A HEBREW TRADITION THAT IT WAS THE OLDEST OF ALL CITIES BUT NOW WE KNOW THAT GREAT EMPIRES FLOURISHED AND PASSED AWAY BEFORE BABYLON WAS BUILT
LJ028-0034 OLD KING SARGON I. WHO MAY HAVE LIVED AS EARLY AS THREE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED B.C
LJ028-0035 SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TO MENTION BABYLON AND ONE OF HIS INSCRIPTIONS SEEMS TO SAY THAT HE BUILT THE CITY AND GAVE IT ITS NAME
LJ028-0036 BUT IN THOSE VERY EARLY DAYS BABYLON WAS LITTLE MORE THAN A SHRINE SURROUNDED WITH MUD HUTS AND DATE PALMS
LJ028-0037 IT WAS ABOUT 2250 B.C. WHEN THE GREAT HAMMURABI MADE IT HIS CAPITAL THAT IT BECAME THE CHIEF CITY OF BABYLONIA
LJ028-0038 ITS HISTORY FOR THE NEXT FIFTEEN HUNDRED YEARS OR MORE IS OBSCURE
LJ028-0039 WE KNOW THE NAMES OF ITS KINGS AND THE RECORDS SPEAK OF LONG WARS WITH THE ASSYRIANS
LJ028-0040 IN THE YEAR SIX EIGHTYNINE B.C. SINACHERIB KING OF NINEVEH CAPTURED BABYLON
LJ028-0041 TORE DOWN ITS PALACES AND TEMPLES AND WALLS AND SCRAPED EVEN THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE CITY INTO THE RIVER
LJ028-0042 THE PLACE WHERE THE OLD CITY HAD STOOD FOR THREE THOUSAND YEARS AGAIN BECAME A DESERT
LJ028-0043 ESARHADDON THE SON OF SINACHERIB WAS THE NEXT KING OF NINEVEH
LJ028-0044 HE REBUILT BABYLON THAT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ANCIENT CUSTOM HE MIGHT BE CROWNED IN THE SACRED CITY
LJ028-0045 WHEN ESARHADDON DIED ONE OF HIS SONS SAMASSUMYUKIN WAS MADE KING OF BABYLON
LJ028-0046 ANOTHER SON ASSURBANIPAL OR THE GREAT SARDANAPALUS OF THE GREEKS BECAME THE KING OF NINEVEH
LJ028-0047 WAR BROKE OUT BETWEEN THE TWO BROTHERS AND AGAIN BABYLON WAS CAPTURED
LJ028-0048 IN 626 ASSURBANIPAL DIED
LJ028-0049 AND IN THAT SAME YEAR NABOPOLASSAR THE FATHER OF THE GREAT NEBUCHADNEZZAR BECAME THE KING OF BABYLON
LJ028-0050 THE BUILDING OF THE BABYLON SO FAMOUS IN HISTORY BEGAN WITH NABOPOLASSAR
LJ028-0051 HE ENLARGED THE OLD CITY ERECTED TEMPLES AND BEGAN THE CONSTRUCTION OF ITS WALLS
LJ028-0052 IN 606 NINEVEH THE OLD ENEMY OF BABYLON FELL NEVER TO RISE AGAIN
LJ028-0053 THE NEXT YEAR IN 605 NABOPOLASSAR DIED AND NEBUCHADNEZZAR SUCCEEDED HIM TO THE THRONE
LJ028-0054 HE CONTINUED THE BUILDING OPERATIONS OF HIS FATHER UNTIL BABYLON BECAME THE GREATEST CITY OF ITS AGE
LJ028-0055 AND SURROUNDED IT WITH WALLS THE LIKE OF WHICH NO OTHER CITY HAS EVER SEEN
LJ028-0056 NEBUCHADNEZZAR OR NEBUCHADREZZAR AS HIS NAME SHOULD BE SPELLED WAS THE GREATEST CHARACTER IN BABYLONIAN HISTORY
LJ028-0057 BUT ABOUT HIS NAME SO MANY LEGENDS HAVE GROWN THAT IT IS SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO LEARN THE FACTS OF HIS LIFE
LJ028-0058 EARLY HE MARRIED AMUHIA A DAUGHTER OF THE MEDEAN KING
LJ028-0059 HIS MILITARY CAREER BEGAN WHILE HE WAS STILL THE CROWN PRINCE AND HIS FATHER WAS ON THE THRONE
LJ028-0060 IN 605
LJ028-0061 AT THE HEAD OF THE BABYLONIAN ARMY HE DEFEATED THE EGYPTIANS IN THE FAMOUS BATTLE OF CARCHEMISH THE OLD HITTITE CAPITAL
LJ028-0062 AND DROVE THEM FROM ASIA
LJ028-0063 THEN SYRIA AND PALESTINE WERE ADDED TO HIS FUTURE EMPIRE
LJ028-0064 IN 597 WHEN HE SENT HIS ARMY TO JERUSALEM HE WON THE HATRED OF THE JEWS BY TAKING JEHOIAKIN THE KING CAPTIVE
LJ028-0065 ELEVEN YEARS LATER IN 586 HE DESTROYED THE SACRED HEBREW CITY
LJ028-0066 TRANSPORTED THE JEWS TO BABYLON AND BROUGHT THE HEBREW KINGDOM TO AN END
LJ028-0067 CENTURIES AFTERWARD EVEN TO THIS DAY JEWISH MOTHERS TEACH THEIR CHILDREN TO HATE HIS NAME
LJ028-0068 THEY TELL HOW HE FORCED THE EXILES TO CARRY HEAVY BAGS OF SAND ACROSS THE DESERT TO INCREASE THEIR BURDENS
LJ028-0069 HOW HE CAST HEBREW LADS INTO A FIERY FURNACE AND INTO THE LIONS' DEN
LJ028-0070 AND HOW IN PUNISHMENT FOR ALL HIS WICKEDNESS HE BECAME A CALF AND FOR SEVEN YEARS GRAZED THE GRASS IN THE FIELDS ABOUT THE CITY
LJ028-0071 LATE IN HIS LIFE IN 567 HE INVADED EGYPT
LJ028-0072 DURING ALL HIS REIGN THERE WAS LITTLE PEACE IN HIS GREAT MIXED TURBULENT EMPIRE
LJ028-0073 THE WALLS OF THE PALACES OF MANY OF THE ASSYRIAN KINGS WERE LINED WITH GREAT STONE SLABS ENGRAVED WITH RELIEFS AND SOMETIMES WITH THE PORTRAIT OF A KING
LJ028-0074 BUT IN BABYLONIA STONE WAS DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN AND SCULPTURES WERE VERY RARE
LJ028-0075 THEREFORE IT WAS USELESS TO HOPE THAT NEBUCHADNEZZAR'S PORTRAIT WOULD BE FOUND ON HIS PALACE WALLS
LJ028-0076 HOWEVER SEVERAL DECADES AGO AN ORIENTAL APPEARED AT THE BERLIN MUSEUM
LJ028-0077 OFFERING FOR SALE A SMALL CAMEO ENGRAVED WITH A HELMETED HEAD OF A GREEK TYPE
LJ028-0078 ABOUT THE HEAD WAS AN INSCRIPTION IN GREEK CHARACTERS SAYING THAT THE FACE WAS THAT OF NEBUCHADNEZZAR
LJ028-0079 THE MUSEUM AUTHORITIES BELIEVED THAT THE CAMEO WAS ONE OF THE MANY SPURIOUS OBJECTS WHICH THE EASTERN FORGERS WERE CONSTANTLY SENDING TO EUROPE
LJ028-0080 YET THEY TOOK AN IMPRESSION OF IT AND RETURNED IT TO ITS OWNER
LJ028-0081 YEARS LATER WHEN THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS COULD READILY DISTINGUISH THE FALSE FROM THE TRUE
LJ028-0082 IT WAS RECOGNIZED THAT THE CAMEO WAS GENUINE AND THAT IT BORE THE LIKENESS OF THE GREAT KING
LJ028-0083 UNFORTUNATELY THE LITTLE STONE SEAL PERHAPS THE ONLY ONE TO PRESERVE FOR US HIS FEATURES APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN LOST FOR EVER
LJ028-0084 ITS IMPRESSION SHOWS THE FACE OF A BEARDLESS YOUNG MAN INTELLIGENT AND REFINED
LJ028-0085 THE EYES ARE SUGGESTIVE OF THE SEMITIC THE NOSE IS OF THE GREEK TYPE
LJ028-0086 THE LIPS ARE THIN THE CHIN PROMINENT THE NECK IS THAT OF A STRONG VIGOROUS MAN
LJ028-0087 SUCH WAS THE APPEARANCE OF THE BUILDER OF THE WALLS OF BABYLON
LJ028-0088 RELIGION AND CRUELTY FREQUENTLY GO HAND IN HAND AND NEBUCHADNEZZAR WAS EXCEEDINGLY RELIGIOUS
LJ028-0089 THOUGH A GREAT WARRIOR IT WAS NOT FOR HIS MILITARY DEEDS THAT HE WAS BEST KNOWN
LJ028-0090 HE WAS FOND OF RESTORING THE RUINED TEMPLES OF THE OLD BABYLONIAN CITIES
LJ028-0091 AND MOST OF THE RECORDS WHICH HAVE COME FROM HIS TIME SPEAK CHIEFLY OF HIS DEEDS OF PIETY
LJ028-0092 READ THE INTRODUCTION TO ANY OF HIS INSCRIPTIONS OF WHICH THE FOLLOWING IS ONE AND YOU WILL CALL HIM VAIN AND PROUD
LJ028-0093 BUT HIS SCRIBE WROTE IT IN THE MANNER CUSTOMARY FOR THE SCRIBES OF THOSE DAYS TO WRITE OF THEIR ROYAL MASTERS
LJ028-0094 NEBUCHADNEZZAR KING OF BABYLON THE EXALTED PRINCE THE FAVORITE OF MARDUK THE LOFTY PATESI
LJ028-0095 THE BELOVED OF NABU THE ARBITER THE POSSESSOR OF WISDOM WHO SEEKS OUT THE PATH OF THEIR DIVINITY
LJ028-0096 WHO REVERENCES THEIR LORDSHIP THE UNTIRING GOVERNOR WHO PONDERS DAILY CONCERNING THE MAINTENANCE OF ESAGIL AND EZIDA
LJ028-0097 AND IS CONTINUALLY ANXIOUS FOR THE SHRINES OF BABYLON AND BORSIPPA
LJ028-0098 THE WISE THE PIOUS THE MAINTAINER OF ESAGIL AND EZIDA
LJ028-0099 THE FIRSTBORN SON OF NABOPOLASSAR KING OF BABYLON AM I
LJ028-0100 HOWEVER CRUEL AND RELIGIOUSLY INTOLERANT NEBUCHADNEZZAR MAY HAVE BEEN HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY THE GREATEST BUILDER THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN
LJ028-0101 THERE IS SCARCELY ONE OF THE THOUSANDS OF RUIN MOUNDS IN BABYLONIA WHICH DOES NOT CONTAIN BRICKS BEARING HIS NAME
LJ028-0102 THERE IS SCARCELY A ROYAL RECORD FROM HIS REIGN WHICH IS NOT CHIEFLY OCCUPIED WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF HIS BUILDING OPERATIONS
LJ028-0103 HE REBUILT SCORES OF THE ANCIENT TEMPLES SURROUNDED MANY CITIES WITH WALLS
LJ028-0104 LINED THE SHORES OF THE RIVERS WITH EMBANKMENTS AND SPANNED THE RIVERS WITH BRIDGES
LJ028-0105 TRADITION SAYS THAT TO PLEASE HIS FOREIGN WIFE FROM THE MOUNTAINOUS COUNTRY HE BUILT THE FAMOUS HANGING GARDENS BUT THAT MAY BE ONLY A TRADITION
LJ028-0106 HIS PALACE IN BABYLON WAS ONE OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST BUILDINGS BUT THE WALLS WITH WHICH HE PROTECTED HIS PALACE AND CITY WERE THE WONDER OF THE WHOLE WORLD
LJ028-0107 THE ANCIENTS NEVER TIRED OF DESCRIBING THEM
LJ028-0108 FORTUNATELY IN SEVERAL OF HIS LONG INSCRIPTIONS RECENTLY DISCOVERED IN THE BABYLONIAN MOUNDS NEBUCHADNEZZAR SPEAKS OF THE BUILDING OF THE WALLS
LJ028-0109 IN ONE OF THEM HE SAYS
LJ028-0110 I COMPLETED IMGURBEL AND NIMITTIBEL THE GREAT WALLS OF BABYLON THE MIGHTY CITY THE CITY OF HIS EXALTED POWER
LJ028-0111 AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE GREAT GATES I ERECTED STRONG BULLS OF BRONZE AND TERRIBLE SERPENTS STANDING UPRIGHT
LJ028-0112 MY FATHER DID THAT WHICH NO PREVIOUS KING HAD DONE
LJ028-0113 WITH MORTAR AND BRICKS HE BUILT TWO MOATWALLS ABOUT THE CITY
LJ028-0114 AND I WITH MORTAR AND BRICKS BUILT A THIRD GREAT MOATWALL AND JOINED IT AND UNITED IT CLOSELY WITH THE MOATWALLS OF MY FATHER
LJ028-0115 I LAID ITS FOUNDATION DEEP TO THE WATER LEVEL
LJ028-0116 I RAISED ITS SUMMIT MOUNTAIN HIGH. I CONSTRUCTED A MOATWALL OF BURNED BRICKS ABOUT THE WEST WALL OF BABYLON
LJ028-0117 MY FATHER BUILT THE MOATWALL OF THE ARACHTU CANAL SECURELY WITH MORTAR AND BRICKS
LJ028-0118 HE BUILT WELL THE QUAYS ALONG THE OPPOSITE SHORE OF THE EUPHRATES BUT HE DID NOT FINISH ALL HIS WORK
LJ028-0119 BUT I HIS FIRSTBORN THE BELOVED OF HIS HEART
LJ028-0120 BUILT THE MOATWALLS OF ARACHTU WITH MORTAR AND BRICKS AND JOINING THEM TOGETHER WITH THOSE OF MY FATHER MADE THEM VERY SOLID
LJ028-0121 A THING WHICH NO KING BEFORE HAD EVER DONE
LJ028-0122 TO THE WEST OF BABYLON AT A GREATER DISTANCE FROM THE OUTER WALL I CONSTRUCTED AN ENCLOSING WALL FOUR THOUSAND CUBITS IN LENGTH ABOUT THE CITY
LJ028-0123 I DUG ITS MOAT TO THE WATER LEVEL
LJ028-0124 I WALLED UP ITS SIDE WITH MORTAR AND BURNED BRICKS AND I UNITED IT SECURELY WITH THE MOATWALLS OF MY FATHER
LJ028-0125 ALONG ITS EDGE I BUILT A GREAT WALL OF MORTAR AND BURNED BRICKS MOUNTAIN HIGH
LJ028-0126 BEROSSUS A PRIEST OF THE TEMPLE OF BEL AT BABYLON WRITING ABOUT 250 B.C
LJ028-0127 WAS LIVING IN THE CITY WHILE THE WALLS WERE STILL STANDING THOUGH IN A RUINOUS CONDITION
LJ028-0128 HIS BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THEM SHOULD NOT BE OMITTED. HE SAYS THAT NEBUCHADNEZZAR
LJ028-0129 BUILT THREE WALLS ROUND ABOUT THE INNER CITY AND THREE OTHERS ABOUT THAT WHICH WAS THE OUTER AND THIS HE DID WITH BURNT BRICK
LJ028-0130 AND AFTER HE HAD WALLED THE CITY AND ADORNED ITS GATES HE BUILT ANOTHER PALACE BEFORE HIS FATHER'S PALACE BUT SO THAT THEY JOINED TO IT
LJ028-0131 TO DESCRIBE WHOSE VAST HEIGHT AND IMMENSE RICHES IT WOULD PERHAPS BE TOO MUCH FOR ME TO ATTEMPT
LJ028-0132 YET AS LARGE AND LOFTY AS THEY WERE THEY WERE COMPLETED IN FIFTEEN DAYS
LJ028-0133 HE ALSO ERECTED ELEVATED PLACES FOR WALKING OF STONE AND MADE IT RESEMBLE MOUNTAINS AND BUILT IT SO THAT IT MIGHT BE PLANTED WITH ALL SORTS OF TREES
LJ028-0134 HE ALSO ERECTED WHAT IS CALLED A PENSILE PARADISE
LJ028-0136 OF ALL THE ANCIENT DESCRIPTIONS OF THE FAMOUS WALLS AND THE CITY THEY PROTECTED THAT OF HERODOTUS IS THE FULLEST
LJ028-0137 PERHAPS HERODOTUS HAD NEVER BEEN IN BABYLON
LJ028-0138 PERHAPS THE TALES THAT TRAVELERS TOLD HIM WERE EXAGGERATED AS TRAVELERS' TALES ARE LIKELY TO BE
LJ028-0139 YET HE AT LEAST TRIED TO BE ACCURATE. HE SAYS
LJ028-0140 THE CITY STANDS ON A BROAD PLAIN AND IS AN EXACT SQUARE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FURLONGS IN LENGTH EACH WAY
LJ028-0141 SO THAT THE ENTIRE CIRCUIT IS FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FURLONGS
LJ028-0142 WHILE SUCH IS ITS SIZE IN MAGNIFICENCE THERE IS NO OTHER CITY THAT APPROACHES TO IT
LJ028-0143 IT IS SURROUNDED IN THE FIRST PLACE BY A BROAD AND DEEP MOAT FULL OF WATER BEHIND WHICH RISES A WALL
LJ028-0144 FIFTY ROYAL CUBITS IN WIDTH AND TWO HUNDRED IN HEIGHT
LJ028-0145 AND HERE I MAY NOT OMIT TO TELL THE USE TO WHICH THE MOULD DUG OUT OF THE GREAT MOAT WAS TURNED NOR THE MANNER WHEREIN THE WALL WAS WROUGHT
LJ028-0146 AS FAST AS THEY DUG THE MOAT THE SOIL WHICH THEY GOT FROM THE CUTTING WAS MADE INTO BRICKS
LJ028-0147 AND WHEN A SUFFICIENT NUMBER WERE COMPLETED THEY BAKED THE BRICKS IN KILNS
LJ028-0148 THEN THEY SET TO BUILDING AND BEGAN BY BRICKING THE BORDERS OF THE MOAT AFTER WHICH THEY PROCEEDED TO CONSTRUCT THE WALL ITSELF
LJ028-0149 USING THROUGHOUT FOR THEIR CEMENT HOT BITUMEN AND INTERPOSING A LAYER OF WATTLED REEDS AT EVERY THIRTIETH COURSE OF THE BRICKS
LJ028-0150 ON THE TOP ALONG THE EDGES OF THE WALL THEY CONSTRUCTED BUILDINGS OF A SINGLE CHAMBER FACING ONE ANOTHER
LJ028-0151 LEAVING BETWEEN THEM ROOM FOR A FOURHORSE CHARIOT TO TURN
LJ028-0152 IN THE CIRCUIT OF THE WALL ARE A HUNDRED GATES ALL OF BRASS WITH BRAZEN LINTELS AND SIDEPOSTS
LJ028-0153 THE BITUMEN USED IN THE WORK WAS BROUGHT TO BABYLON FROM IS A SMALL STREAM WHICH FLOWS INTO THE EUPHRATES
LJ028-0154 AT THE POINT WHERE THE CITY OF THE SAME NAME STANDS EIGHT DAYS' JOURNEY FROM BABYLON
LJ028-0155 LUMPS OF BITUMEN ARE FOUND IN GREAT ABUNDANCE IN THIS RIVER
LJ028-0156 THE CITY IS DIVIDED INTO TWO PORTIONS BY THE RIVER WHICH RUNS THROUGH THE MIDST OF IT
LJ028-0157 THIS RIVER IS THE EUPHRATES A BROAD DEEP SWIFT STREAM WHICH RISES IN ARMENIA AND EMPTIES ITSELF INTO THE ERYTHRAEAN SEA
LJ028-0158 THE CITY WALL IS BROUGHT DOWN ON BOTH SIDES TO THE EDGE OF THE STREAM
LJ028-0159 THENCE FROM THE CORNERS OF THE WALL THERE IS CARRIED ALONG EACH BANK OF THE RIVER A FENCE OF BURNED BRICKS
LJ028-0160 THE HOUSES ARE MOSTLY THREE AND FOUR STORIES HIGH
LJ028-0161 THE STREETS ALL RUN IN STRAIGHT LINES NOT ONLY THOSE PARALLEL TO THE RIVER BUT ALSO THE CROSS STREETS WHICH LEAD DOWN TO THE WATERSIDE
LJ028-0162 AT THE RIVER END OF THESE CROSS STREETS ARE LOW GATES IN THE FENCE THAT SKIRTS THE STREAM
LJ028-0163 WHICH ARE LIKE THE GREAT GATES IN THE OUTER WALL OF BRASS AND OPEN ON THE WATER
LJ028-0164 THE OUTER WALL IS THE MAIN DEFENSE OF THE CITY
LJ028-0165 THERE IS HOWEVER A SECOND INNER WALL OF LESS THICKNESS THAN THE FIRST BUT VERY LITTLE INFERIOR TO IT IN STRENGTH
LJ028-0166 THE CENTER OF EACH DIVISION OF THE TOWN IS OCCUPIED BY A FORTRESS
LJ028-0167 IN THE ONE STOOD THE PALACE OF THE KINGS SURROUNDED BY A WALL OF GREAT STRENGTH AND SIZE
LJ028-0168 IN THE OTHER WAS THE SACRED PRECINCT OF JUPITER BELUS
LJ028-0169 A SQUARE ENCLOSURE TWO FURLONGS EACH WAY WITH GATES OF SOLID BRASS WHICH WAS ALSO REMAINING IN MY TIME
LJ028-0170 IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PRECINCT THERE WAS A TOWER OF SOLID MASONRY A FURLONG IN LENGTH AND BREADTH
LJ028-0171 UPON WHICH WAS RAISED A SECOND TOWER AND ON THAT A THIRD AND SO ON UP TO EIGHT
LJ028-0172 THE ASCENT TO THE TOP IS ON THE OUTSIDE BY A PATH WHICH WINDS ROUND ALL THE TOWERS
LJ028-0173 WHEN ONE IS ABOUT HALFWAY UP ONE FINDS A RESTING PLACE AND SEATS WHERE PERSONS ARE WONT TO SIT SOMETIMES ON THEIR WAY TO THE SUMMIT
LJ028-0174 OTHER ANCIENT DESCRIPTIONS OF THE WALLS HAVE BEEN LEFT US BY CTESIAS OF THE FIFTH CENTURY B.C. AND BY STRABO OF THE BEGINNING OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA
LJ028-0175 BUT THEY ADD LITTLE TO OUR KNOWLEDGE
LJ028-0176 SHOULD WE COMPARE THESE ANCIENT DESCRIPTIONS OF THE WALLS WE SHOULD FIND THEM HOPELESSLY CONFLICTING
LJ028-0177 HOWEVER THEY TEACH US THAT IN THOSE EARLY DAYS WHEN MOST CITIES WERE SURROUNDED BY ENORMOUS WALLS
LJ028-0178 THE WALLS OF BABYLON WERE SO LONG AND WIDE AND HIGH THAT ALL WHO SAW THEM WERE AMAZED
LJ028-0179 IT IS ONLY FROM THEIR RUINS THAT WE MAY HOPE TO OBTAIN ACCURATE INFORMATION OF THE STRONGEST FORTIFICATIONS IN THE ANCIENT WORLD
LJ028-0180 IN THE YEAR 562 AFTER A LONG REIGN OF FORTYTHREE YEARS NEBUCHADNEZZAR DIED
LJ028-0181 HE WAS FOLLOWED BY THREE KINGS WHOSE REIGNS WERE SHORT
LJ028-0182 AND IN 555 NABONIDUS THE FATHER OF THE BIBLICAL BELSHAZZAR CAME TO THE THRONE
LJ028-0183 CYRUS THE KING OF PERSIA WAS RISING TO POWER AND AFTER HE HAD DEFEATED THE MEDES
LJ028-0184 HE EXTENDED HIS EMPIRE TO THE MEDITERRANEAN AND EVEN TO EGYPT
LJ028-0185 PERHAPS BABYLON WAS SO STRONGLY FORTIFIED THAT AT FIRST HE MADE NO ATTEMPT TO ADD IT TO HIS EMPIRE
LJ028-0186 BUT WHEN NABONIDUS JOINED WITH THE KING OF EGYPT AND WITH THE WEALTHY CROESUS OF LYDIA IN AN ALLIANCE AGAINST HIM
LJ028-0187 CYRUS DECIDED THAT BABYLON MUST BE TAKEN
LJ028-0188 IN 538 THE CITY FELL AND FOR A TIME IT BECAME THE HOME OF THE PERSIAN KING
LJ028-0189 THE FALL OF BABYLON WITH ITS LOFTY WALLS WAS A MOST IMPORTANT EVENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE ANCIENT WORLD
LJ028-0190 A GREAT EMPIRE WHICH HAD EXISTED FOR MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND YEARS WAS BROUGHT TO AN END
LJ028-0191 THE OLD ENEMIES OF BABYLON REJOICED
LJ028-0192 WHEN THE NEWS CAME TO THE HEBREWS WHO WERE HELD THERE IN EXILE THEY EXCITEDLY RUSHED ABOUT THE STREETS CRYING BABYLON IS FALLEN
LJ028-0193 AND TO THEM CAME HOPE OF RETURNING TO JERUSALEM
LJ028-0194 BUT HOW DID THE MIGHTY CITY FALL HOW COULD CYRUS TAKE BABYLON WHOSE WALLS WERE STRONG ENOUGH TO RESIST ANY ARMY
LJ028-0195 IT IS A LONG STORY. POETS HAVE SUNG IT. HISTORIANS HAVE WRITTEN IT PROPHETS HAVE PREACHED IT LEGENDS HAVE GATHERED ABOUT IT
LJ028-0196 EVERY CHILD KNOWS THE STORY OF THE WRITING OF THE HAND ON THE WALL. IT WAS THE NIGHT THAT BABYLON FELL
LJ028-0197 BELSHAZZAR THE KING HE WAS REALLY THE KING'S SON GAVE A FEAST TO A THOUSAND OF HIS NOBLES
LJ028-0198 IN THE GREAT BANQUET HALL OF THE PALACE WHEN THE GUESTS WERE DRINKING FROM THE GOLDEN CUPS AND THE REVELRY WAS AT ITS HIGHEST
LJ028-0199 THERE SUDDENLY APPEARED UPON THE WALL AN ARMLESS HAND
LJ028-0200 HIGH UP WHERE ALL MIGHT SEE IT THE ARMLESS HAND WROTE THE KING'S FATE
LJ028-0201 THOU ART WEIGHED IN THE BALANCES AND ART FOUND WANTING
LJ028-0202 IN THAT NIGHT SO THE STORY ENDS BELSHAZZAR THE CHALDEAN KING WAS SLAIN
LJ028-0203 LESS PICTURESQUE THAN THIS HEBREW LEGEND IS THE ROYAL RECORD OF BABYLON WHICH FORTUNATELY WAS INSCRIBED UPON A CLAY CYLINDER FROM THE RUINS OF THE CITY
LJ028-0204 IT REFERS TO THE DEATH OF THE KING'S SON POSSIBLY TO BELSHAZZAR OF THE BIBLE STORY
LJ028-0205 IN THE MONTH TAMMUZ WHEN CYRUS FOUGHT THE TROOPS OF AKKAD BABYLONIA AT OPIS ON THE RIVER SALSALLAT
LJ028-0206 HE SUBDUED THE PEOPLE AND WHEREVER THEY COLLECTED HE SLEW THEM
LJ028-0207 ON THE FOURTEENTH DAY SIPPAR WAS TAKEN WITHOUT A BATTLE
LJ028-0208 NABONIDUS FLED
LJ028-0209 ON THE SIXTEENTH DAY THE TROOPS OF CYRUS ENTERED BABYLON WITHOUT A BATTLE
LJ028-0210 NABONIDUS WAS TAKEN PRISONER IN BABYLON. ON THE THIRD OF MARCHESVAN CYRUS ENTERED BABYLON AND PROCLAIMED PEACE TO ALL THE CITY
LJ028-0211 HE APPOINTED GOBRIAS GOVERNOR OF BABYLON
LJ028-0212 ON THE NIGHT OF THE ELEVENTH DAY GOBRIAS KILLED THE SON OF THE KING
LJ028-0213 NOR DOES THE ROYAL RECORD OF BABYLON CONTAIN THE ONLY CONTEMPORARY ACCOUNT OF THE FALL OF THE CITY
LJ028-0214 FOR UPON A BARRELSHAPED CYLINDER OF CLAY BEARING A LONG INSCRIPTION WE HAVE CYRUS'S ACCOUNT OF HIS CAPTURE OF BABYLON. EXTRACTS FROM IT ARE AS FOLLOWS
LJ028-0215 MARDUK THE GREAT LORD LOOKING WITH JOY ON HIS PIOUS WORKS AND UPRIGHT HEART
LJ028-0216 COMMANDED HIM CYRUS TO GO FORTH TO HIS CITY BABYLON AND HE WENT BY HIS SIDE AS A FRIEND AND COMPANION
LJ028-0217 HIS MANY TROOPS WHOSE NUMBER LIKE THE WATERS OF THE RIVER COULD NOT BE COUNTED MARCHED IN FULL ARMOR AT HIS SIDE
LJ028-0218 WITHOUT A SKIRMISH OR A BATTLE HE PERMITTED THEM TO ENTER BABYLON AND SPARING THE CITY HE DELIVERED THE KING NABONIDUS TO HIM
LJ028-0219 ALL THE PEOPLE OF BABYLON PROSTRATED THEMSELVES BEFORE HIM AND KISSING HIS FEET REJOICED IN HIS SOVEREIGNTY WHILE HAPPINESS SHONE ON THEIR FACES
LJ028-0220 THE INSCRIPTION CONTINUES I AM CYRUS KING OF THE WORLD
LJ028-0221 WHEN I MADE MY GRACIOUS ENTRY INTO BABYLON WITH EXCEEDING JOY I TOOK UP MY ABODE IN THE ROYAL PALACE
LJ028-0222 MY MANY TROOPS MARCHED PEACEFULLY INTO BABYLON
LJ028-0223 I GAVE HEED TO THE NEEDS OF BABYLON AND ITS CITIES AND THE SERVITUDE OF THE BABYLONIANS WHATEVER WAS OPPRESSIVE I REMOVED FROM THEM
LJ028-0224 I QUIETED THEIR SIGHINGS AND SOOTHED THEIR SORROWS
LJ028-0225 A MUCH LONGER ACCOUNT OF THE CAPTURE OF BABYLON BY CYRUS APPEARS IN THE WRITINGS OF HERODOTUS
LJ028-0226 THOUGH HERODOTUS WROTE NEARLY A HUNDRED YEARS AFTER BABYLON FELL HIS STORY SEEMS TO BEAR THE STAMP OF TRUTH
LJ028-0227 HE CERTAINLY MENTIONS DETAILS WHICH NEITHER NABONIDUS NOR CYRUS WOULD CARE TO HAVE APPEAR IN THEIR ROYAL RECORDS HIS STORY IS AS FOLLOWS
LJ028-0228 CYRUS WITH THE FIRST APPROACH OF THE ENSUING SPRING MARCHED FORWARD AGAINST BABYLON
LJ028-0229 THE BABYLONIANS ENCAMPED WITHOUT THEIR WALLS AWAITED HIS COMING
LJ028-0230 A BATTLE WAS FOUGHT AT A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE CITY IN WHICH THE BABYLONIANS WERE DEFEATED BY THE PERSIAN KING
LJ028-0231 WHEREUPON THEY WITHDREW WITHIN THEIR DEFENSES
LJ028-0232 HERE THEY SHUT THEMSELVES UP AND MADE LIGHT OF HIS SIEGE HAVING LAID IN A STORE OF PROVISION FOR MANY YEARS IN PREPARATION AGAINST THIS ATTACK
LJ028-0233 FOR WHEN THEY SAW CYRUS CONQUERING NATION AFTER NATION THEY WERE CONVINCED THAT HE WOULD NEVER STOP AND THEIR TURN WOULD COME AT LAST
LJ028-0234 CYRUS WAS NOW REDUCED TO GREAT PERPLEXITY AS TIME WENT ON AND HE MADE NO PROGRESS AGAINST THE PLACE
LJ028-0235 IN THIS DISTRESS EITHER SOMEONE MADE THIS SUGGESTION TO HIM OR HE BETHOUGHT HIMSELF OF A PLAN WHICH HE PROCEEDED TO PUT IN EXECUTION
LJ028-0236 HE PLACED A PORTION OF HIS ARMY AT THE POINT WHERE THE RIVER ENTERS THE CITY AND ANOTHER BODY AT THE BACK OF THE PLACE WHERE IT ISSUES FORTH
LJ028-0237 WITH ORDERS TO MARCH INTO THE TOWN BY THE BED OF THE STREAM AS SOON AS THE WATER BECAME SHALLOW ENOUGH
LJ028-0238 HE THEN HIMSELF DREW OFF WITH THE UNWARLIKE PORTION OF HIS HOST AND MADE FOR THE PLACE WHERE NITOCRIS DUG THE BASIN FOR THE RIVER
LJ028-0239 WHERE HE DID EXACTLY WHAT SHE HAD DONE FORMERLY HE TURNED THE EUPHRATES BY A CANAL INTO THE BASIN WHICH WAS THEN A MARSH
LJ028-0240 ON WHICH THE RIVER SANK TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THE NATURAL BED OF THE STREAM BECAME FORDABLE
LJ028-0241 HEREUPON THE PERSIANS WHO HAD BEEN LEFT FOR THE PURPOSE AT BABYLON BY THE RIVER SIDE
LJ028-0242 ENTERED THE STREAM WHICH HAD NOW SUNK SO AS TO REACH ABOUT MIDWAY UP A MAN'S THIGH AND THUS GOT INTO THE TOWN
LJ028-0243 HAD THE BABYLONIANS BEEN APPRISED OF WHAT CYRUS WAS ABOUT OR HAD THEY NOTICED THEIR DANGER THEY WOULD NEVER HAVE ALLOWED THE PERSIANS TO ENTER THE CITY
LJ028-0244 BUT WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THEM UTTERLY FOR THEY WOULD HAVE MADE FAST ALL THE STREET GATES WHICH GAVE UPON THE RIVER
LJ028-0245 AND MOUNTING UPON THE WALLS ALONG BOTH SIDES OF THE STREAM WOULD SO HAVE CAUGHT THE ENEMY AS IT WERE IN A TRAP
LJ028-0246 BUT AS IT WAS THE PERSIANS CAME UPON THEM BY SURPRISE AND SO TOOK THE CITY
LJ028-0247 OWING TO THE VAST SIZE OF THE PLACE THE INHABITANTS OF THE CENTRAL PARTS AS THE RESIDENTS OF BABYLON DECLARE
LJ028-0248 LONG AFTER THE OUTER PORTIONS OF THE TOWN WERE TAKEN KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT HAD CHANCED BUT AS THEY WERE ENGAGED IN A FESTIVAL
LJ028-0249 CONTINUED DANCING AND REVELING UNTIL THEY LEARNED THE CAPTURE BUT TOO CERTAINLY
LJ028-0250 SUCH THEN WERE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE FIRST TAKING OF BABYLON
LJ028-0251 WHEN CYRUS TOOK BABYLON LITTLE OR NO FORCE WAS EMPLOYED
LJ028-0252 ONLY THE KING'S SON BELSHAZZAR WAS KILLED
LJ028-0253 THE CITY WAS SPARED THE GREAT WALLS WERE LEFT STANDING THE DAILY SACRIFICES WERE CONTINUED IN THE TEMPLES AND CYRUS MADE HIS HOME IN THE ROYAL PALACE
LJ028-0254 THE PEOPLE ENJOYING THE GREATER FREEDOM WHICH CYRUS PERMITTED THEM WERE CONTENTED AND LIFE IN BABYLON WENT ON ABOUT AS BEFORE
LJ028-0255 IN 529 CYRUS DIED
LJ028-0256 DURING THE REIGNS OF THE TWO FOLLOWING PERSIAN KINGS BABYLON WAS SLOWLY REGAINING ITS INDEPENDENCE
LJ028-0257 AND IN 521 NEBUCHADNEZZAR III. A NATIVE BABYLONIAN WAS PLACED ON THE THRONE
LJ028-0258 THEN THE BABYLONIANS SECRETLY PLOTTED TO THROW OFF THE PERSIAN YOKE
LJ028-0259 THAT SAME YEAR WHEN DARIUS HYSTASPES CAME TO THE PERSIAN THRONE THE BABYLONIANS OPENLY REBELLED
LJ028-0260 THE FOLLOWING STORY FROM HERODOTUS TELLS THE RESULTS
LJ028-0261 AT LAST WHEN THE TIME CAME FOR REBELLING OPENLY THEY DID AS FOLLOWS
LJ028-0262 HAVING FIRST SET APART THEIR MOTHERS EACH MAN CHOSE BESIDES OUT OF HIS WHOLE HOUSEHOLD ONE WOMAN WHOMSOEVER HE PLEASED
LJ028-0263 THESE ALONE WERE ALLOWED TO LIVE WHILE ALL THE REST WERE BROUGHT TO ONE PLACE AND STRANGLED
LJ028-0264 THE WOMEN CHOSEN WERE KEPT TO MAKE BREAD FOR THE MEN WHILE THE OTHERS WERE STRANGLED THAT THEY MIGHT NOT CONSUME THE STORES
LJ028-0265 WHEN TIDINGS REACHED DARIUS OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED
LJ028-0266 HE DREW TOGETHER ALL HIS POWER AND BEGAN THE WAR BY MARCHING STRAIGHT UPON BABYLON AND LAYING SIEGE TO THE PLACE
LJ028-0267 THE BABYLONIANS HOWEVER CARED NOT A WHIT FOR HIS SIEGE
LJ028-0268 MOUNTING UPON THE BATTLEMENTS THAT CROWNED THEIR WALLS THEY INSULTED AND JEERED AT DARIUS AND HIS MIGHTY HOST
LJ028-0269 ONE EVEN SHOUTED TO THEM AND SAID WHY SIT YE THERE PERSIANS WHY DO YE NOT GO BACK TO YOUR HOMES TILL MULES FOAL YE WILL NOT TAKE OUR CITY
LJ028-0270 THIS WAS SAID BY A BABYLONIAN WHO THOUGHT THAT A MULE WOULD NEVER FOAL
LJ028-0271 NOW WHEN A YEAR AND SEVEN MONTHS HAD PASSED DARIUS AND HIS ARMY WERE QUITE WEARIED OUT FINDING THAT THEY COULD NOT ANYHOW TAKE THE CITY
LJ028-0272 ALL STRATAGEMS AND ALL ARTS HAD BEEN USED AND YET THE KING COULD NOT PREVAIL
LJ028-0273 NOT EVEN WHEN HE TRIED THE MEANS BY WHICH CYRUS HAD MADE HIMSELF MASTER OF THE PLACE
LJ028-0274 THE BABYLONIANS WERE EVER UPON THE WATCH AND HE FOUND NO WAY OF CONQUERING THEM
LJ028-0275 AT LAST IN THE TWENTIETH MONTH
LJ028-0276 A MARVELOUS THING HAPPENED TO ZOPYRUS SON OF THE MEGABYZUS WHO WAS AMONG THE SEVEN MEN THAT OVERTHREW THE MAGUS
LJ028-0277 ONE OF HIS SUMPTERMULES GAVE BIRTH TO A FOAL
LJ028-0278 ZOPYRUS WHEN THEY TOLD HIM NOT THINKING THAT IT COULD BE TRUE WENT AND SAW THE COLT WITH HIS OWN EYES
LJ028-0279 AFTER WHICH HE COMMANDED HIS SERVANTS TO TELL NO ONE WHAT HAD COME TO PASS WHILE HE HIMSELF PONDERED THE MATTER
LJ028-0280 CALLING TO MIND THEN THE WORDS OF THE BABYLONIAN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SIEGE
LJ028-0281 TILL MULES FOAL YE SHALL NOT TAKE OUR CITY HE THOUGHT AS HE REFLECTED ON THIS SPEECH THAT BABYLON MIGHT NOW BE TAKEN
LJ028-0282 FOR IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THERE WAS A DIVINE PROVIDENCE IN THE MAN HAVING USED THE PHRASE AND THEN HIS MULE HAVING FOALED
LJ028-0283 AS SOON THEREFORE AS HE FELT WITHIN HIMSELF THAT BABYLON WAS FATED TO BE TAKEN HE WENT TO DARIUS AND ASKED HIM IF HE SET A VERY HIGH VALUE ON ITS CONQUEST
LJ028-0284 WHEN HE FOUND THAT DARIUS DID INDEED VALUE IT HIGHLY HE CONSIDERED FURTHER WITH HIMSELF HOW HE MIGHT MAKE THE DEED HIS OWN AND BE THE MAN TO TAKE BABYLON
LJ028-0285 NOBLE EXPLOITS IN PERSIA ARE EVER HIGHLY HONORED AND BRING THEIR AUTHORS TO GREATNESS
LJ028-0286 HE THEREFORE REVIEWED ALL WAYS OF BRINGING THE CITY UNDER
LJ028-0287 BUT FOUND NONE BY WHICH HE COULD HOPE TO PREVAIL UNLESS HE MAIMED HIMSELF AND THEN WENT OVER TO THE ENEMY
LJ028-0288 TO DO THIS SEEMING TO HIM A LIGHT MATTER HE MUTILATED HIMSELF IN A WAY THAT WAS UTTERLY WITHOUT REMEDY
LJ028-0289 FOR HE CUT OFF HIS OWN NOSE AND EARS AND THEN CLIPPING HIS HAIR CLOSE AND FLOGGING HIMSELF WITH A SCOURGE
LJ028-0290 HE CAME IN THIS PLIGHT BEFORE DARIUS
LJ028-0291 WRATH STIRRED WITHIN THE KING AT THE SIGHT OF A MAN OF HIS LOFTY RANK IN SUCH A CONDITION
LJ028-0292 LEAPING DOWN FROM HIS THRONE HE EXCLAIMED ALOUD AND ASKED ZOPYRUS WHO IT WAS THAT HAD DISFIGURED HIM AND WHAT HE HAD DONE TO BE SO TREATED
LJ028-0293 ZOPYRUS ANSWERED THERE IS NOT A MAN IN THE WORLD BUT THOU O KING THAT COULD REDUCE ME TO SUCH A PLIGHT
LJ028-0294 NO STRANGER'S HANDS HAVE WROUGHT THIS WORK ON ME BUT MY OWN ONLY
LJ028-0295 I MAIMED MYSELF BECAUSE I COULD NOT ENDURE THAT THE ASSYRIANS SHOULD LAUGH AT THE PERSIANS. WRETCHED MAN SAID DARIUS
LJ028-0296 THOU COVEREST THE FOULEST DEEDS WITH THE FAIREST POSSIBLE NAME WHEN THOU SAYEST THY MAIMING IS TO HELP OUR SIEGE FORWARD
LJ028-0297 HOW WILL THY DISFIGUREMENT THOU SIMPLETON INDUCE THE ENEMY TO YIELD ONE DAY SOONER
LJ028-0298 SURELY THOU HADST GONE OUT OF THY MIND WHEN THOU DIDST SO MISUSE THYSELF
LJ028-0299 HAD I TOLD THEE REJOINED THE OTHER WHAT I WAS BENT ON DOING THOU WOULDST NOT HAVE SUFFERED IT
LJ028-0300 AS IT IS I KEPT MY OWN COUNSEL AND SO ACCOMPLISHED MY PLANS
LJ028-0301 NOW THEREFORE IF THERE BE NO FAILURE ON THY PART WE SHALL TAKE BABYLON
LJ028-0302 I WILL DESERT TO THE ENEMY AS I AM AND WHEN I GET INTO THEIR CITY I WILL TELL THEM THAT IT IS BY THEE THAT I HAVE BEEN THUS TREATED
LJ028-0303 I THINK THEY WILL BELIEVE MY WORDS AND ENTRUST ME WITH A COMMAND OF TROOPS. THOU ON THY PART MUST WAIT
LJ028-0304 TILL THE TENTH DAY AFTER I AM ENTERED WITHIN THE TOWN AND THEN PLACE NEAR TO THE GATES OF SEMIRAMIS A DETACHMENT OF THY ARMY
LJ028-0305 TROOPS FOR WHOSE LOSS THOU WILT CARE LITTLE A THOUSAND MEN
LJ028-0306 WAIT AFTER THAT SEVEN DAYS AND POST ME ANOTHER DETACHMENT TWO THOUSAND STRONG AT THE NINEVEH GATES
LJ028-0307 THEN LET TWENTY DAYS PASS AND AT THE END OF THAT TIME STATION NEAR THE CHALDASAN GATES A BODY OF FOUR THOUSAND
LJ028-0308 LET NEITHER THESE NOR THE FORMER TROOPS BE ARMED WITH ANY WEAPONS BUT THEIR SWORDS THOSE THOU MAYEST LEAVE THEM
LJ028-0309 AFTER THE TWENTY DAYS ARE OVER BID THY WHOLE ARMY ATTACK THE CITY ON EVERY SIDE AND PUT ME TWO BODIES OF PERSIANS
LJ028-0310 ONE AT THE BELIAN THE OTHER AT THE CISSIAN GATES FOR I EXPECT THAT ON ACCOUNT OF MY SUCCESSES
LJ028-0311 THE BABYLONIANS WILL ENTRUST EVERYTHING EVEN THE KEYS OF THEIR GATES TO ME. THEN IT WILL BE FOR ME AND MY PERSIANS TO DO THE REST
LJ028-0312 HAVING LEFT THESE INSTRUCTIONS ZOPYRUS FLED TOWARDS THE GATES OF THE TOWN OFTEN LOOKING BACK TO GIVE HIMSELF THE AIR OF A DESERTER
LJ028-0313 THE MEN UPON THE TOWERS WHOSE BUSINESS IT WAS TO KEEP A LOOKOUT
LJ028-0314 OBSERVING HIM HASTENED DOWN AND SETTING ONE OF THE GATES SLIGHTLY AJAR QUESTIONED HIM WHO HE WAS AND ON WHAT ERRAND HE HAD COME
LJ028-0315 HE REPLIED THAT HE WAS ZOPYRUS AND DESERTED TO THEM FROM THE PERSIANS
LJ028-0316 THEN THE DOORKEEPERS WHEN THEY HEARD THIS CARRIED HIM AT ONCE BEFORE THE MAGISTRATES
LJ028-0317 INTRODUCED INTO THEIR ASSEMBLY HE BEGAN TO BEWAIL HIS MISFORTUNES TELLING THEM THAT
LJ028-0318 DARIUS HAD MALTREATED HIM IN THE WAY THEY COULD SEE ONLY BECAUSE HE HAD GIVEN ADVICE THAT THE SIEGE SHOULD BE RAISED SINCE THERE SEEMED NO HOPE OF TAKING THE CITY
LJ028-0319 AND NOW HE WENT ON TO SAY MY COMING TO YOU BABYLONIANS
LJ028-0320 WILL PROVE THE GREATEST GAIN THAT YOU COULD POSSIBLY RECEIVE WHILE TO DARIUS AND THE PERSIANS IT WILL BE THE SEVEREST LOSS
LJ028-0321 VERILY HE BY WHOM I HAVE BEEN SO MUTILATED SHALL NOT ESCAPE UNPUNISHED. AND TRULY ALL THE PATHS OF HIS COUNSELS ARE KNOWN TO ME
LJ028-0322 THUS DID ZOPYRUS SPEAK
LJ028-0323 THE BABYLONIANS SEEING A PERSIAN OF SUCH EXALTED RANK IN SO GRIEVOUS A PLIGHT HIS NOSE AND EARS CUT OFF
LJ028-0324 HIS BODY RED WITH MARKS OF SCOURGING AND WITH BLOOD HAD NO SUSPICION BUT THAT HE SPOKE THE TRUTH AND WAS REALLY COME TO BE THEIR FRIEND AND HELPER
LJ028-0325 THEY WERE READY THEREFORE TO GRANT HIM ANYTHING HE ASKED
LJ028-0326 AND ON HIS SUING FOR A COMMAND THEY ENTRUSTED TO HIM A BODY OF TROOPS WITH THE HELP OF WHICH HE PROCEEDED TO DO AS HE HAD ARRANGED WITH DARIUS
LJ028-0327 ON THE TENTH DAY AFTER HIS FLIGHT HE LED OUT HIS DETACHMENT AND SURROUNDING THE THOUSAND MEN
LJ028-0328 WHOM DARIUS ACCORDING TO AGREEMENT HAD SENT FIRST HE FELL UPON THEM AND SLEW THEM ALL
LJ028-0329 THEN THE BABYLONIANS SEEING THAT HIS DEEDS WERE AS BRAVE AS HIS WORDS WERE BEYOND MEASURE PLEASED AND SET NO BOUNDS TO THEIR TRUST
LJ028-0330 AND WHEN THE NEXT PERIOD AGREED ON HAD ELAPSED AGAIN WITH A BAND OF PICKED MEN HE SALLIED FORTH AND SLAUGHTERED THE TWO THOUSAND
LJ028-0331 AFTER THIS SECOND EXPLOIT HIS PRAISE WAS IN ALL MOUTHS
LJ028-0332 ONCE MORE HOWEVER HE WAITED TILL THE INTERVAL APPOINTED HAD GONE BY AND THEN LEADING THE TROOPS TO THE PLACE WHERE THE FOUR THOUSAND WERE
LJ028-0333 HE PUT THEM ALSO TO THE SWORD
LJ028-0334 THIS LAST VICTORY GAVE HIM THE FINISHING STROKE TO HIS POWER AND MADE HIM ALL IN ALL WITH THE BABYLONIANS
LJ028-0335 ACCORDINGLY THEY COMMITTED TO HIM THE COMMAND OF THEIR WHOLE ARMY AND PUT THE KEYS OF THEIR CITY INTO HIS HANDS
LJ028-0336 DARIUS NOW STILL KEEPING TO THE PLAN AGREED UPON
LJ028-0337 ATTACKED THE WALLS ON EVERY SIDE WHEREUPON ZOPYRUS PLAYED OUT THE REMAINDER OF HIS STRATAGEM
LJ028-0338 WHILE THE BABYLONIANS CROWDING TO THE WALLS DID THEIR BEST TO RESIST THE PERSIAN ASSAULT
LJ028-0339 HE THREW OPEN THE CISSIAN AND BELIAN GATES AND ADMITTED THE ENEMY
LJ028-0340 SUCH OF THE BABYLONIANS AS WITNESSED THE TREACHERY TOOK REFUGE IN THE TEMPLE OF JUPITER BELUS
LJ028-0341 THE REST WHO DID NOT SEE IT KEPT AT THEIR POSTS TILL AT LAST THEY TOO LEARNED THAT THEY WERE BETRAYED
LJ028-0342 THUS WAS BABYLON TAKEN FOR THE SECOND TIME
LJ028-0343 DARIUS HAVING BECOME MASTER OF THE PLACE DESTROYED THE WALL AND TORE DOWN ALL THE GATES
LJ028-0344 FOR CYRUS HAD DONE NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER WHEN HE TOOK BABYLON
LJ028-0345 HE THEN CHOSE OUT NEAR THREE THOUSAND OF THE LEADING CITIZENS AND CAUSED THEM TO BE CRUCIFIED WHILE HE ALLOWED THE REMAINDER STILL TO INHABIT THE CITY
LJ028-0346 FURTHER WISHING TO PREVENT THE RACE OF THE BABYLONIANS FROM BECOMING EXTINCT
LJ028-0347 HE PROVIDED WIVES FOR THEM IN THE ROOM OF THOSE WHOM AS I EXPLAINED BEFORE THEY STRANGLED TO SAVE THEIR STORES
LJ028-0348 THESE HE LEVIED FROM THE NATIONS BORDERING ON BABYLONIA
LJ028-0349 WHO WERE EACH REQUIRED TO SEND SO LARGE A NUMBER TO BABYLON THAT IN ALL THERE WERE COLLECTED NO FEWER THAN FIFTY THOUSAND
LJ028-0350 IT IS FROM THESE WOMEN THAT THE BABYLONIANS OF OUR TIMES ARE SPRUNG
LJ028-0351 AS FOR ZOPYRUS HE WAS CONSIDERED BY DARIUS TO HAVE SURPASSED IN THE GREATNESS OF HIS ACHIEVEMENTS ALL OTHER PERSIANS
LJ028-0352 WHETHER OF FORMER OR OF LATER TIMES EXCEPT ONLY CYRUS WITH WHOM NO PERSON EVER YET THOUGHT HIMSELF WORTHY TO COMPARE
LJ028-0353 DARIUS AS THE STORY GOES WOULD OFTEN SAY THAT HE HAD RATHER ZOPYRUS WERE UNMAIMED THAN BE MASTER OF TWENTY MORE BABYLONS
LJ028-0354 AND HE HONORED ZOPYRUS GREATLY YEAR BY YEAR HE PRESENTED HIM WITH ALL THE GIFTS WHICH ARE HELD IN MOST ESTEEM AMONG THE PERSIANS
LJ028-0355 HE GAVE HIM LIKEWISE THE GOVERNMENT OF BABYLON FOR HIS LIFE FREE FROM TRIBUTE AND HE ALSO GRANTED HIM MANY OTHER FAVORS
LJ028-0356 HOW MUCH TRUTH THERE MAY BE IN THIS INTERESTING TALE OF HERODOTUS WE MAY NEVER KNOW
LJ028-0357 YET WE MAY BE SURE THAT BABYLON WAS TAKEN BY DARIUS ONLY BY USE OF STRATAGEM. ITS WALLS WERE IMPREGNABLE
LJ028-0358 CYRUS HAD PERMITTED THEM TO STAND AND AS LONG AS HE MADE BABYLON HIS HOME THE CITY WAS AS STRONGLY PROTECTED AS EVER
LJ028-0359 DARIUS WHO BESIEGED THE REBELLIOUS CITY TWICE WEAKENED IT BY DESTROYING SOME OF ITS WALLS
LJ028-0360 DURING THE REIGN OF XERXES AGAIN THE CITY REBELLED AND IN 484 B.C. HE CAPTURED IT AND COMPLETELY DEMOLISHED ITS DEFENSES
LJ028-0361 YET BABYLON CONTINUED TO LIVE
LJ028-0362 FOR HISTORY MENTIONS THE NAMES OF TWO OF ITS LATER RULERS. THE PALACE OF NEBUCHADNEZZAR WAS OCCUPIED BY ALEXANDER THE GREAT
LJ028-0363 AND THERE ON JUNE 13 323 B.C. HE MET HIS DEATH
LJ028-0364 THE CITY THEN FELL TO SELEUCUS
LJ028-0365 ONE OF ALEXANDER'S GENERALS WHO FOR A TIME MADE IT HIS HOME BUT HE WAS A GREEK AND CARED LITTLE FOR THINGS BABYLONIAN
LJ028-0366 THEREFORE TO DESTROY THE POWER OF THE OLD CAPITAL HE PLANNED TO BUILD SELEUCIA ON THE TIGRIS ABOUT FIFTY MILES TO THE EAST
LJ028-0367 THE PRIESTS OF THE TEMPLE OF BEL SO A STORY TELLS US
LJ028-0368 LEARNED OF HIS PURPOSE AND WHEN THEY WERE CONSULTED AS TO THE MOST FAVORABLE TIME FOR BEGINNING THE WORK UPON THE NEW CITY
LJ028-0369 THEY INTENTIONALLY MENTIONED A MOST UNFAVORABLE HOUR
LJ028-0370 THE PRIESTS' DECEPTION WAS UNAVAILING AND IN 275 B.C. THE INHABITANTS OF BABYLON WERE TRANSPORTED TO SELEUCIA
LJ028-0371 THEN THE WORLD METROPOLIS STRIPPED OF MOST OF ITS POPULATION BECAME A MERE VILLAGE
LJ028-0372 THE POOR OF THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY OCCUPIED ITS DISMANTLED PALACES
LJ028-0373 THE HEBREW EXILES WHOSE ANCESTORS NEBUCHADNEZZAR HAD BROUGHT FROM JERUSALEM
LJ028-0374 SETTLED THERE AND FINALLY THE PLACE WAS ABANDONED TO THE ARABS OF THE DESERT
LJ028-0375 SLOWLY THE FEW REMAINING WALLS FELL AND WERE BURIED IN THEIR OWN RUINS
LJ028-0376 AS THE CENTURIES PASSED THE MOUNDS INTO WHICH THE CITY HAD TURNED GREW HIGHER AND HIGHER WITH THE RUINS OF THE HUTS LATER BUILT UPON THEM
LJ028-0377 UNTIL AT LAST THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE TEMPLES AND PALACES WERE BURIED FULLY A HUNDRED FEET BENEATH THE SURFACE
LJ028-0378 EVEN THE SHEPHERDS CEASED TO GRAZE THEIR SHEEP THERE AND THE WANDERING ARABS
LJ028-0379 FEARING THE WILD BEASTS AND EVIL SPIRITS WHICH LURK AMONG ALL OLD RUINS REFUSED TO PITCH THEIR TENTS THERE
LJ028-0380 THE PROPHECY OF THE HEBREW ISAIAH WAS FULFILLED
LJ028-0381 WILD BEASTS OF THE DESERT SHALL LIE THERE
LJ028-0382 AND THEIR HOUSES SHALL BE FULL OF DOLEFUL CREATURES AND OWLS SHALL DWELL THERE AND SATYRS SHALL DANCE THERE
LJ028-0383 AND THE WILD BEASTS OF THE ISLANDS SHALL CRY IN THEIR DESOLATE HOUSES AND DRAGONS IN THEIR PLEASANT PALACES
LJ028-0384 SO BABYLON WAS BURIED AND FORGOTTEN
LJ028-0385 IT HAD BECOME AS DIO CASSIUS SAID MOUNDS AND LEGENDS AND RUINS
LJ028-0386 BUT THE WALLS OF THE OLD CITY HAD NOT YET SERVED THEIR FULL PURPOSE
LJ028-0387 THE SASSANIAN KINGS OF PERSIA WERE FOND OF HUNTING AND BABYLON THEN OVERGROWN WITH TREES WAS THEIR GAME PRESERVE
LJ028-0388 THE OLD WALLS WERE RESTORED TO A HEIGHT SUFFICIENT TO PREVENT THE ESCAPE OF THE ANIMALS AND AMONG THE RUINS THE KINGS ENJOYED THEIR FAVORITE SPORT
LJ028-0389 ST. JEROME SAID
LJ028-0390 I WAS INFORMED BY A CERTAIN ELAMITE BROTHER WHO CAME FROM THOSE REGIONS AND NOW LEADS THE LIFE OF A MONK AT JERUSALEM
LJ028-0391 THAT THERE IS A ROYAL HUNTING GROUND AT BABYLON AND THAT WILD GAME OF EVERY KIND IS CONTAINED WITHIN THE CIRCUIT OF ITS WALLS
LJ028-0392 THE STATEMENT OF ST. JEROME IS CONFIRMED BY THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE FROM ZOSIMUS A GREEK WRITER OF THE FIFTH CENTURY A.D
LJ028-0393 AS THE EMPEROR JULIAN WAS MARCHING FORWARD THROUGH BABYLONIA
LJ028-0394 HE PASSED OTHER UNIMPORTANT FORTRESSES AND CAME AT LAST TO A WALLED ENCLOSURE WHICH THE NATIVES POINTED OUT AS A ROYAL HUNTING GROUND
LJ028-0395 IT WAS A LOW RAMPART ENCLOSING A WIDE SPACE PLANTED WITH TREES OF EVERY SORT IN WHICH ALL KINDS OF BEASTS WERE SHUT UP
LJ028-0396 THEY WERE SUPPLIED WITH FOOD BY KEEPERS AND GAVE THE KING THE OPPORTUNITY OF HUNTING WHENEVER HE FELT INCLINED
LJ028-0397 WHEN JULIAN SAW THIS HE CAUSED A LARGE PART OF THE WALL TO BE OVERTHROWN AND AS THE BEASTS ESCAPED THEY WERE SHOT DOWN BY HIS SOLDIERS
LJ028-0398 THE WALLS OF BABYLON WERE DESTINED TO SERVE STILL ANOTHER PURPOSE
LJ028-0399 THE SPREAD OF MOHAMMEDANISM CAUSED NEW CITIES TO BE BUILT AND BABYLON WAS THE QUARRY FOR THEIR BUILDING MATERIAL
LJ028-0400 THE WALLS OF BABYLON WERE TRANSFORMED INTO THE SACRED CITIES OF KERBELA AND NEJEF
LJ028-0401 IN THE ELEVENTH CENTURY ON THE SITE OF THE SOUTHERN PART OF BABYLON THE CITY OF HILLAH WAS BUILT
LJ028-0402 HILLAH MIGHT BE CALLED A CHILD OF BABYLON FOR IT IS ALMOST ENTIRELY CONSTRUCTED WITH NEBUCHADNEZZAR'S BRICKS
LJ028-0403 THE WALLS OF THE HOUSES ARE BUILT OF THEM
LJ028-0404 THE COURTYARDS AND STREETS ARE PAVED WITH THEM AND AS YOU WALK ABOUT THE CITY THE NAME OF NEBUCHADNEZZAR EVERYWHERE MEETS YOUR EYE
LJ028-0405 MANY OF THE TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE LIVING IN HILLAH STILL GAIN THEIR LIVELIHOOD BY DIGGING THE BRICKS FROM THE RUINS TO SELL TO THE MODERN BUILDERS
LJ028-0406 THE GREAT IRRIGATING DAMS ACROSS THE EUPHRATES ARE CONSTRUCTED ENTIRELY OF THEM
LJ028-0407 THE PEOPLE OF HILLAH TOO ARE A SURVIVAL OF BABYLONIAN TIMES
LJ028-0408 SOME ARE ARABS OF THE SAME TRIBES WHICH USED TO ROAM THE DESERT IN NEBUCHADNEZZAR'S DAYS. SOME ARE THE CHILDREN OF THE HEBREW EXILES OF OLD
LJ028-0409 SOME CALLING THEMSELVES CHRISTIANS ARE THE DESCENDANTS OF BABYLONIANS PERHAPS OF NEBUCHADNEZZAR HIMSELF
LJ028-0410 THERE AMONG THE RUINS THEY STILL LIVE IN THE SAME KIND OF HOUSES
LJ028-0411 DRESSING THE SAME EATING THE SAME FOOD AS DID THEIR ANCESTORS WHEN NEBUCHADNEZZAR BUILT THE WALLS OF BABYLON
LJ028-0412 AMONG THE FIRST OF THE MODERN TRAVELERS TO DESCRIBE THE RUINS OF BABYLON WAS ANTHONY SHIRLEY AN ENGLISHMAN WHO VISITED MESOPOTAMIA IN 1599
LJ028-0413 IN HIS QUAINT WAY HE SAYS
LJ028-0414 ALL THE GROUND ON WHICH BABYLON WAS SPREAD IS LEFT NOW DESOLATE NOTHING STANDING IN THAT PENINSULA BETWEEN THE EUPHRATES AND THE TIGRIS
LJ028-0415 BUT ONLY PART AND THAT A SMALL PART OF THE GREAT TOWER WHICH GOD HATH SUFFERED TO STAND
LJ028-0416 IF MAN MAY SPEAK SO CONFIDENTLY OF HIS GREAT IMPENETRABLE COUNSELS FOR AN ETERNAL TESTIMONY OF HIS GREAT WORK IN THE CONFUSION OF MAN'S PRIDE
LJ028-0417 AND THAT ARKE OF NEBUCHADNEZZAR FOR AS PERPETUAL A MEMORY OF HIS GREAT IDOLATRY AND CONDIGNE PUNISHMENT
LJ028-0418 ABOUT THAT SAME TIME PIETRO DELLA VALLE AN ITALIAN VISITED BABYLON
LJ028-0419 AND DIGGING FROM THE WALL AN INSCRIBED SQUARE BRICK BEARING THE NAME OF NEBUCHADNEZZAR HE TOOK IT TO ROME WHERE IT MAY STILL BE SEEN
LJ028-0420 THAT WAS THE FIRST OBJECT TAKEN FROM BABYLON TO EUROPE
LJ028-0421 IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE GREAT COLLECTIONS OF BABYLONIAN ANTIQUITIES IN THE MUSEUMS OF THE WESTERN WORLD
LJ028-0422 AMONG THE LATER VISITORS TO BABYLON WAS THE GREAT NIEBUHR
LJ028-0423 IN EIGHTEEN TWELVE JAMES CLAUDIUS RICH THE BRITISH RESIDENT AT BAGHDAD MADE THE FIRST COMPLETE EXAMINATION OF THE RUINS
LJ028-0424 PORTER LAYARD AND RAWLINSON FOLLOWED HIM BUT THE REAL SCIENTIFIC EXPLORATION OF BABYLON AND ITS WALLS
LJ028-0425 WAS BEGUN BY THE DEUTSCHE ORIENTGESELLSCHAFT IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE AND CONTINUED TILL THE SUMMER OF NINETEEN FIFTEEN
LJ028-0426 FOR FIFTEEN YEARS DR. KOLDEWEY AND HIS ASSISTANTS WITH A FORCE OF TWO HUNDRED NATIVE WORKMEN HAVE LABORED THERE WINTER AND SUMMER
LJ028-0427 THE ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF DEBRIS WHICH BURIED THE PALACES AND TEMPLES AND WALLS OF NEBUCHADNEZZAR'S CITY IN PLACES TO THE DEPTH OF A HUNDRED FEET
LJ028-0428 HAS BEEN REMOVED AND THE SURROUNDING CITY WALLS HAVE BEEN TRACED
LJ028-0429 THE EXCAVATIONS HAVE SHOWN THAT BABYLON AS THE ANCIENTS TOLD US WAS NEARLY SQUARE
LJ028-0430 THE EUPHRATES FLOWED THROUGH IT BUT THE GREATER PART OF THE CITY WAS ON THE EASTERN SHORE
LJ028-0431 THE CITY WALLS OF WHICH THE ANCIENTS WERE SO PROUD APPEAR HERE AND THERE LIKE LOW RIDGES FAR OUT ON THE PLAIN
LJ028-0432 OTHER PARTS OF THEM HAVE DISAPPEARED ENTIRELY
LJ028-0433 IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE ENCLOSURE TO THE EAST OF THE RIVER
LJ028-0434 THE LARGE HIGH MOUND WHICH RESEMBLES A MOUNTAIN FROM A DISTANCE STILL BEARS THE ANCIENT NAME BABEL
LJ028-0435 ARABS SEARCHING FOR BRICKS HAVE BURROWED THEIR WAY DOWN DEEP INTO IT REVEALING MASSIVE WALLS AND ARCHES
LJ028-0436 THE GERMANS MAINTAIN THAT IT IS THE RUIN OF THE TOWER OF BABEL
LJ028-0437 HERE IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED WERE THE FAMOUS HANGING GARDENS WHICH SOME ANCIENT AUTHORS INCLUDED AMONG THE SEVEN WONDERS OF THE WORLD
LJ028-0438 HOWEVER IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE HANGING GARDENS EXISTED ONLY IN THE IMAGINATION OF THE GREEK WRITERS
LJ028-0439 FOR NONE OF THE MANY BUILDING INSCRIPTIONS FROM NEBUCHADNEZZAR MENTIONS THEM
LJ028-0440 POSSIBLY ALONG THE TERRACES OF THE WALLS OR UPON THE STAGES OF SOME LOFTY TEMPLE TOWER
LJ028-0441 TREES AND OVERHANGING VINES WERE PLANTED AND THUS THE TRAVELERS' TALES AROSE
LJ028-0442 AT A DISTANCE OF ABOUT TWO MILES TO THE SOUTH OF BABEL IS THE LARGER AND LOWER MOUND CALLED THE KASR OR THE FORTRESS
LJ028-0443 BECAUSE GREAT MASSES OF MASONRY USED TO PROJECT FROM ITS SURFACE
LJ028-0444 DEEP DOWN IN THE MOUND THE GERMANS DISCOVERED THE PALACE OF NEBUCHADNEZZAR WITH ITS HUNDREDS OF SMALL CHAMBERS AND ITS HUGE SURROUNDING WALLS
LJ028-0445 THE MOUND STILL FARTHER SOUTH IS CALLED AMRAN BECAUSE UPON ITS SUMMIT STANDS THE TOMB OF A MOHAMMEDAN SAINT OF THAT NAME
LJ028-0446 THERE LIE THE RUINS OF THE FAMOUS TEMPLE OF ESAGIL SACRED TO MARDUK
LJ028-0447 UPON THE LITTLE MOUND JUMJUMA FARTHER ON AN ARAB VILLAGE HAS LONG STOOD
LJ028-0448 ALL OF THE ANCIENT WRITERS AGREE IN SAYING THAT BABYLON WAS SURROUNDED WITH BOTH INNER AND OUTER WALLS AND THE RUINS CONFIRM THEIR STATEMENTS
LJ028-0449 PARTS OF THE WALLS OF NINEVEH ARE STILL STANDING TO THE HEIGHT OF ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTYFIVE FEET
LJ028-0450 BUT THE WALLS OF BABYLON HAVE SO LONG BEEN USED TO SUPPLY BRICKS TO THE BUILDERS OF THE NEIGHBORING CITIES THAT ONLY THEIR BASES REMAIN
LJ028-0451 IN PLACES EVEN THE BASES HAVE DISAPPEARED AND THEIR MOATS HAVE LONG BEEN FILLED WITH THE DRIFTING SAND
LJ028-0452 THE OUTER WALL BORE THE NAME OF NIMITTIBEL. ITS DIRECTION WAS NORTHEAST AND SOUTHWEST FORMING A TRIANGLE WITH THE RIVER
LJ028-0453 THE NORTHEASTERN SECTION MAY NOW BE TRACED FOR A DISTANCE OF LESS THAN THREE MILES AND THE SOUTHWESTERN FOR MORE THAN A MILE
LJ028-0454 BUT BOTH SECTIONS ORIGINALLY REACHED THE RIVER
LJ028-0455 IT SEEMS THAT THE CIRCUIT OF THE OUTER WALL WAS ABOUT ELEVEN MILES
LJ028-0456 THE SMALL PORTIONS OF IT WHICH HAVE BEEN EXCAVATED SUFFICE TO SHOW ITS CONSTRUCTION
LJ028-0457 THE MOAT TEN FEET DEEP AND OF A WIDTH NO LONGER KNOWN RAN CLOSE TO ITS BASE. THE WALL WAS DOUBLE
LJ028-0458 ITS OUTER PART WAS ABOUT TWENTYFOUR FEET IN THICKNESS AND ITS FOUNDATIONS AS NEBUCHADNEZZAR SAID WERE CARRIED DOWN TO THE WATER LEVEL
LJ028-0459 ITS BRICKS MEASURING ABOUT THIRTEEN INCHES SQUARE AND THREE INCHES IN THICKNESS WERE BURNED AND STAMPED WITH THE USUAL SHORT INSCRIPTION
LJ028-0460 NEBUCHADNEZZAR KING OF BABYLON THE RESTORER OF THE TEMPLES ESAGIL AND EZIDA
LJ028-0461 THE FIRSTBORN SON OF NABOPOLASSAR KING OF BABYLON
LJ028-0462 THEY WERE LAID IN BITUMEN
LJ028-0463 THE INNER PART OF THE WALL WAS CONSTRUCTED OF UNBURNED BRICKS AND AT A DISTANCE OF ABOUT THIRTYSIX FEET FROM THE OUTER PART
LJ028-0464 THE INTERVENING SPACE WHICH WAS FILLED WITH DIRT PROBABLY TO THE UPPER INNER EDGE OF THE OUTER PART
LJ028-0465 SERVED AS AN ELEVATED ROAD WHERE SEVERAL CHARIOTS MIGHT HAVE BEEN DRIVEN ABREAST
LJ028-0466 THIS INNER PART WAS ABOUT TWENTYFOUR FEET WIDE AND AT INTERVALS OF ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY FEET IT WAS SURMOUNTED WITH TOWERS
LJ028-0467 THE ENTIRE WIDTH OF THE OUTER DEFENSE NOT INCLUDING THE MOAT WAS THEREFORE ABOUT EIGHTYTWO FEET
LJ028-0468 ITS HEIGHT WAS PROBABLY MORE THAN DOUBLE ITS WIDTH BUT THAT MAY NEVER BE DETERMINED
LJ028-0469 THE INNER WALL OF BABYLON WAS CALLED IMGURBEL AND LIKE THE OUTER WALL IT WAS DOUBLE
LJ028-0470 TIME HAS DEALT EVEN LESS KINDLY WITH IT FOR IT MAY BE TRACED ONLY FOR THE DISTANCE OF ABOUT A MILE ALONG ITS EASTERN SIDE
LJ028-0471 NEBUCHADNEZZAR SAYS THAT HE BUILT IT OF BURNED BRICKS BUT ONLY SUNDRIED BRICKS LAID IN MUD NOW APPEAR
LJ028-0472 ITS OUTER PART ABOUT TWELVE FEET IN WIDTH WAS PROTECTED WITH TOWERS AT INTERVALS OF SIXTYFIVE FEET
LJ028-0473 A SPACE OF ABOUT TWENTYTHREE FEET SEPARATED IT FROM ITS INNER PART WHICH WAS ABOUT TWENTY FEET IN WIDTH
LJ028-0474 IT TOO WAS SURMOUNTED WITH TOWERS
LJ028-0475 NO TRACES OF ITS MOAT HAVE APPEARED
LJ028-0476 THE ENTIRE WIDTH OF THIS INNER DEFENSE WAS ABOUT FIFTYFIVE FEET ITS HEIGHT IS UNCERTAIN
LJ028-0477 TO PROTECT THE SUNDRIED BRICKS OF THE INNER WALL FROM THE WINTER RAINS
LJ028-0478 THERE WERE DRAINS OF LARGE BURNED BRICKS SOME OF WHICH BORE THE FOLLOWING LONG INSCRIPTION
LJ028-0479 NEBUCHADNEZZAR KING OF BABYLON
LJ028-0480 THE EXALTED PRINCE THE PROTECTOR OF ESAGIL AND EZIDA SON OF NABOPOLASSAR KING OF BABYLON AM I
LJ028-0481 NABOPOLASSAR THE FATHER MY BEGETTER BUILT IMGURBEL THE GREAT WALL OF BABYLON
LJ028-0482 BUT I THE DEVOUT PETITIONER THE WORSHIPPER OF THE GODS BUILT THE MOAT AND MADE ITS WALL OF BURNED BRICK AND BITUMEN MOUNTAIN HIGH
LJ028-0483 O MARDUK GREAT GOD LOOK JOYFULLY UPON THE PRECIOUS WORK OF MY HANDS. BE THOU MY PROTECTOR
LJ028-0484 GRANT ME AS A GIFT A LIFE OF DISTANT DAYS
LJ028-0485 THE OUTER AND INNER DEFENSES OF BABYLON WERE SO STRONG AND SO HIGH THAT NO ENEMY COULD HOPE TO TAKE THEM
LJ028-0486 YET THE PALACE OF NEBUCHADNEZZAR WAS PROTECTED BY A THIRD DEFENSE FAR STRONGER
LJ028-0487 FORTUNATELY ITS WALLS HAVE SUFFERED LESS FROM THE HANDS OF THE BRICK HUNTERS AND THE GERMAN EXCAVATORS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RECONSTRUCT THEIR PLAN
LJ028-0488 THEY MAY BEST BE DESCRIBED BY MEANS OF THE ACCOMPANYING DIAGRAM REPRESENTING A CROSS SECTION
LJ028-0489 HAD THE ENEMY OF BABYLON SUCCEEDED IN BREAKING THROUGH THE OUTER AND INNER DEFENSES OF THE CITY THE ROYAL PALACE WOULD HAVE STILL BEEN FAR FROM HIS REACH
LJ028-0490 HE WOULD HAVE HAD TO CROSS A DEEP MOAT TO SCALE A WALL OF BURNED BRICKS ABOUT TWENTY FEET IN THICKNESS AND PERHAPS THREE TIMES AS HIGH
LJ028-0491 THEN A SECOND WALL STILL HIGHER A THIRD AND FOURTH AND A FIFTH EACH STRONGER AND HIGHER THAN THE OTHERS
LJ028-0492 AND SURMOUNTED WITH TOWERS AND THEN FINALLY A SIXTH WALL
LJ028-0493 WHOSE SUMMIT REACHED INTO THE SKY AS FAR PERHAPS AS THE TALLEST OF THE MODERN BUILDINGS
LJ028-0494 BETWEEN THE SEVERAL SECTIONS WERE WIDE SPACES WHERE FOOT SOLDIERS AND CHARIOTEERS MIGHT FIGHT
LJ028-0495 IT MUST HAVE BEEN AN IMPOSING SIGHT TO ONE STANDING WITHOUT TO HAVE SEEN THE WALLS ONE AFTER ANOTHER
LJ028-0496 RISING HIGHER AND HIGHER LIKE A GREAT TERRACED TURRETED MOUNTAIN
LJ028-0497 WE DO NOT KNOW THEIR HEIGHT FOR THE STATEMENTS OF THE ANCIENT WRITERS DISAGREE
LJ028-0498 HERODOTUS SAYS THAT IT WAS THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTYFIVE FEET
LJ028-0499 CTESIAS MENTIONS THREE HUNDRED FEET PROBABLY THEY WERE NOT FAR FROM THE TRUTH
LJ028-0500 THE RUINS REACH THE HEIGHT OF ABOUT FORTY FEET
LJ028-0501 NOR WERE THE WALLS ABOUT THE PALACE A GREAT MASS OF DULL BRICK MASONRY
LJ028-0502 THE ISHTAR GATEWAY LEADING TO THE PALACE WAS ENCASED WITH BEAUTIFUL BLUE GLAZED BRICKS
LJ028-0503 AND DECORATED HERE AND THERE WITH LARGE RELIEFS REPRESENTING BULLS AND LIONS AND DRAGONS
LJ028-0504 DESIGNED IN COLORS OF WHITE AND BLUE AND YELLOW AND BLACK
LJ028-0505 IT SEEMS THAT THE BRICKS OF THE RELIEFS WERE MOLDED AND GLAZED SEPARATELY AND SO ACCURATELY THAT WHEN BUILT INTO THE WALL THEY FITTED PERFECTLY
LJ028-0506 A MODERN ARTIST WOULD HAVE DIFFICULTY IN DOING SUCH ACCURATE WORK
LJ028-0507 SOME OF THESE DECORATIONS THE MOST VALUABLE OBJECTS FOUND IN THE RUINS OF THE GREAT CITY STILL REMAIN IN THEIR PLACES ON THE WALLS
LJ028-0508 OTHERS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO THE BERLIN MUSEUM
LJ028-0509 NEBUCHADNEZZAR SPEAKS OF GREAT BRONZE GATES AND OF IMAGES OF BRONZE BUT NONE HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED
LJ028-0510 PROBABLY THEIR METAL WAS FAR TOO VALUABLE FOR THE ENEMY TO LEAVE BEHIND
LJ028-0511 SHOULD YOU WALK ALONG THE SHORE OF THE EUPHRATES AT BABYLON YOU WOULD STILL SEE THE EMBANKMENTS WHICH NEBUCHADNEZZAR CONSTRUCTED OF BRICKS BEARING HIS NAME
LJ028-0512 BUT THE RIVER WALLS HAVE DISAPPEARED AND THE BUTTRESSES OF THE BRIDGES HAVE BEEN TORN OR WASHED AWAY
LJ028-0513 SHOULD YOU CROSS THE RIVER TO SEARCH FOR THE WESTERN INNER WALL YOU WOULD FIND BUT A SMALL FRAGMENT OF IT
LJ028-0514 THE GREAT OUTER WALL SEEMS TO HAVE DISAPPEARED COMPLETELY BENEATH THE DESERT SURFACE
LJ028-0515 SUCH WERE THE WALLS OF BABYLON
LJ028-0516 THE STRONGEST THE THICKEST THE LOFTIEST THE MOST INTRICATE PERHAPS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THAT EVER PROTECTED A CITY
LJ028-0517 WALLS WHICH NO ANCIENT ARMY WAS EVER ABLE TO TAKE BY STORM
LJ028-0518 IT IS NOT STRANGE THEN THAT THEY WERE INCLUDED AMONG THE SEVEN WONDERS OF THE WORLD
LJ028-0519 OR THAT THE BABYLONIAN SOLDIER STOOD CONFIDENTLY UPON THEIR SUMMIT AND JEERING AT THE PERSIAN ARMY ENCAMPED BELOW SHOUTED
LJ029-0001 REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION ON THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY. THE WARREN COMMISSION REPORT. BY THE PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION ON THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY
LJ029-0002 CHAPTER TWO THE ASSASSINATION PART ONE
LJ029-0003 THIS CHAPTER DESCRIBES PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S TRIP TO DALLAS FROM ITS ORIGIN THROUGH ITS TRAGIC CONCLUSION
LJ029-0004 THE NARRATIVE OF THESE EVENTS IS BASED LARGELY ON THE RECOLLECTIONS OF THE PARTICIPANTS
LJ029-0005 ALTHOUGH IN MANY INSTANCES DOCUMENTARY OR OTHER EVIDENCE HAS ALSO BEEN USED BY THE COMMISSION
LJ029-0006 BEGINNING WITH THE ADVANCE PLANS AND SECRET SERVICE PREPARATIONS FOR THE TRIP
LJ029-0007 THIS CHAPTER REVIEWS THE MOTORCADE THROUGH DALLAS THE FLEETING MOMENTS OF THE ASSASSINATION
LJ029-0008 THE ACTIVITIES AT PARKLAND MEMORIAL HOSPITAL AND THE RETURN OF THE PRESIDENTIAL PARTY TO WASHINGTON
LJ029-0009 AN EVALUATION OF THE PROCEDURES EMPLOYED TO SAFEGUARD THE PRESIDENT WITH RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING THESE PROCEDURES APPEARS IN CHAPTER 8 OF THE REPORT
LJ029-0010 PLANNING THE TEXAS TRIP
LJ029-0011 PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S VISIT TO TEXAS IN NOVEMBER NINETEEN SIXTY THREE HAD BEEN UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR ALMOST A YEAR BEFORE IT OCCURRED
LJ029-0012 HE HAD MADE ONLY A FEW BRIEF VISITS TO THE STATE SINCE THE NINETEEN SIXTY PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN AND IN NINETEEN SIXTY TWO HE BEGAN TO CONSIDER A FORMAL VISIT
LJ029-0013 DURING NINETEEN SIXTY THREE THE REASONS FOR MAKING THE TRIP BECAME MORE PERSUASIVE
LJ029-0014 AS A POLITICAL LEADER THE PRESIDENT WISHED TO RESOLVE THE FACTIONAL CONTROVERSY WITHIN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN TEXAS BEFORE THE ELECTION OF NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR
LJ029-0015 THE PARTY ITSELF SAW AN OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE FUNDS BY HAVING THE PRESIDENT SPEAK AT A POLITICAL DINNER EVENTUALLY PLANNED FOR AUSTIN
LJ029-0016 AS CHIEF OF STATE THE PRESIDENT ALWAYS WELCOMED THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN FIRSTHAND ABOUT THE PROBLEMS WHICH CONCERNED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
LJ029-0017 MOREOVER HE LOOKED FORWARD TO THE PUBLIC APPEARANCES WHICH HE PERSONALLY ENJOYED. THE BASIC DECISION ON THE NOVEMBER TRIP TO TEXAS WAS MADE AT A MEETING OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY
LJ029-0018 VICE PRESIDENT JOHNSON AND GOVERNOR CONNALLY ON JUNE 5TH NINETEEN SIXTY THREE AT THE CORTEZ HOTEL IN EL PASO TEXAS
LJ029-0019 THE PRESIDENT HAD SPOKEN EARLIER THAT DAY AT THE AIR FORCE ACADEMY IN COLORADO SPRINGS COLORADO
LJ029-0020 AND HAD STOPPED IN EL PASO TO DISCUSS THE PROPOSED VISIT AND OTHER MATTERS WITH THE VICE PRESIDENT AND THE GOVERNOR
LJ029-0021 THE THREE AGREED THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD COME TO TEXAS IN LATE NOVEMBER NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ029-0022 THE ORIGINAL PLAN CALLED FOR THE PRESIDENT TO SPEND ONLY 1 DAY IN THE STATE MAKING WHIRLWIND VISITS TO DALLAS FORT WORTH SAN ANTONIO AND HOUSTON
LJ029-0023 IN SEPTEMBER THE WHITE HOUSE DECIDED TO PERMIT FURTHER VISITS BY THE PRESIDENT AND EXTENDED THE TRIP TO RUN FROM THE AFTERNOON OF NOVEMBER 21
LJ029-0024 THROUGH THE EVENING OF FRIDAY NOVEMBER 22
LJ029-0025 WHEN GOVERNOR CONNALLY CALLED AT THE WHITE HOUSE ON OCTOBER 4 TO DISCUSS THE DETAILS OF THE VISIT
LJ029-0026 IT WAS AGREED THAT THE PLANNING OF EVENTS IN TEXAS WOULD BE LEFT LARGELY TO THE GOVERNOR
LJ029-0027 AT THE WHITE HOUSE KENNETH O'DONNELL SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT ACTED AS COORDINATOR FOR THE TRIP
LJ029-0028 EVERYONE AGREED THAT IF THERE WAS SUFFICIENT TIME A MOTORCADE THROUGH DOWNTOWN DALLAS WOULD BE THE BEST WAY FOR THE PEOPLE TO SEE THEIR PRESIDENT
LJ029-0029 WHEN THE TRIP WAS PLANNED FOR ONLY 1 DAY GOVERNOR CONNALLY HAD OPPOSED THE MOTORCADE BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH TIME. THE GOVERNOR STATED HOWEVER THAT QUOTE
LJ029-0030 ONCE WE GOT SAN ANTONIO MOVED FROM FRIDAY TO THURSDAY AFTERNOON WHERE THAT WAS HIS INITIAL STOP IN TEXAS
LJ029-0031 THEN WE HAD THE TIME AND I WITHDREW MY OBJECTIONS TO A MOTORCADE. END QUOTE
LJ029-0032 ACCORDING TO O'DONNELL QUOTE WE HAD A MOTORCADE WHEREVER WE WENT END QUOTE
LJ029-0033 PARTICULARLY IN LARGE CITIES WHERE THE PURPOSE WAS TO LET THE PRESIDENT BE SEEN BY AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE
LJ029-0034 IN HIS EXPERIENCE QUOTE IT WOULD BE AUTOMATIC END QUOTE FOR THE SECRET SERVICE TO ARRANGE A ROUTE WHICH WOULD WITHIN THE TIME ALLOTTED
LJ029-0035 BRING THE PRESIDENT QUOTE THROUGH AN AREA WHICH EXPOSES HIM TO THE GREATEST NUMBER OF PEOPLE END QUOTE
LJ029-0036 ADVANCE PREPARATIONS FOR THE DALLAS TRIP
LJ029-0037 ADVANCE PREPARATIONS FOR PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S VISIT TO DALLAS WERE PRIMARILY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF TWO SECRET SERVICE AGENTS
LJ029-0038 SPECIAL AGENT WINSTON G. LAWSON A MEMBER OF THE WHITE HOUSE DETAIL WHO ACTED AS THE ADVANCE AGENT AND FORREST V. SORRELS
LJ029-0039 SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE OF THE DALLAS OFFICE. BOTH AGENTS WERE ADVISED OF THE TRIP ON NOVEMBER 4
LJ029-0040 LAWSON RECEIVED A TENTATIVE SCHEDULE OF THE TEXAS TRIP ON NOVEMBER 8 FROM ROY H. KELLERMAN ASSISTANT SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE OF THE WHITE HOUSE DETAIL
LJ029-0041 WHO WAS THE SECRET SERVICE OFFICIAL RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ENTIRE TEXAS JOURNEY
LJ029-0042 AS ADVANCE AGENT WORKING CLOSELY WITH SORRELS LAWSON HAD RESPONSIBILITY FOR ARRANGING THE TIMETABLE FOR THE PRESIDENT'S VISIT TO DALLAS
LJ029-0043 AND COORDINATING LOCAL ACTIVITIES WITH THE WHITE HOUSE STAFF THE ORGANIZATIONS DIRECTLY CONCERNED WITH THE VISIT AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS
LJ029-0044 LAWSON'S MOST IMPORTANT RESPONSIBILITIES WERE TO TAKE PREVENTIVE ACTION AGAINST ANYONE IN DALLAS CONSIDERED A THREAT TO THE PRESIDENT
LJ029-0045 TO SELECT THE LUNCHEON SITE AND MOTORCADE ROUTE AND TO PLAN SECURITY MEASURES FOR THE LUNCHEON AND THE MOTORCADE
LJ029-0046 PREVENTIVE INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES. THE PROTECTIVE RESEARCH SECTION PRS OF THE SECRET SERVICE
LJ029-0047 MAINTAINS RECORDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE THREATENED THE PRESIDENT OR SO CONDUCTED THEMSELVES AS TO BE DEEMED A POTENTIAL DANGER TO HIM
LJ029-0048 ON NOVEMBER 8 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ029-0049 AFTER UNDERTAKING THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADVANCE PREPARATIONS FOR THE VISIT TO DALLAS AGENT LAWSON WENT TO THE PRS OFFICES IN WASHINGTON
LJ029-0050 A CHECK OF THE GEOGRAPHIC INDEXES THERE REVEALED NO LISTING FOR ANY INDIVIDUAL DEEMED TO BE A POTENTIAL DANGER TO THE PRESIDENT
LJ029-0051 IN THE TERRITORY OF THE SECRET SERVICE REGIONAL OFFICE WHICH INCLUDES DALLAS AND FORT WORTH
LJ029-0052 TO SUPPLEMENT THE PRS FILES THE SECRET SERVICE DEPENDS LARGELY ON LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND LOCAL OFFICES OF OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES
LJ029-0053 WHICH ADVISE IT OF POTENTIAL THREATS IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE VISIT OF THE PRESIDENT TO THEIR COMMUNITY
LJ029-0054 UPON HIS ARRIVAL IN DALLAS ON NOVEMBER 12
LJ029-0055 LAWSON CONFERRED WITH THE LOCAL POLICE AND THE LOCAL OFFICE OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION ABOUT POTENTIAL DANGERS TO THE PRESIDENT
LJ029-0056 ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO MENTION IN PRS FILES OF THE DEMONSTRATION IN DALLAS AGAINST AMBASSADOR ADLAI STEVENSON ON OCTOBER 24TH
LJ029-0057 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE LAWSON INQUIRED ABOUT THE INCIDENT AND OBTAINED THROUGH THE LOCAL POLICE PHOTOGRAPHS OF SOME OF THE PERSONS INVOLVED
LJ029-0058 ON NOVEMBER 22 A SECRET SERVICE AGENT STOOD AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE TRADE MART WHERE THE PRESIDENT WAS SCHEDULED TO SPEAK WITH COPIES OF THESE PHOTOGRAPHS
LJ029-0059 DALLAS DETECTIVES IN THE LOBBY OF THE TRADE MART AND IN THE LUNCHEON AREA ALSO HAD COPIES OF THESE PHOTOGRAPHS
LJ029-0060 A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO RESEMBLED SOME OF THOSE IN THE PHOTOGRAPHS WERE PLACED UNDER SURVEILLANCE AT THE TRADE MART
LJ029-0061 THE FBI OFFICE IN DALLAS GAVE THE LOCAL SECRET SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES THE NAME OF A POSSIBLY DANGEROUS INDIVIDUAL IN THE DALLAS AREA WHO WAS INVESTIGATED
LJ029-0062 IT ALSO ADVISED THE SECRET SERVICE OF THE CIRCULATION ON NOVEMBER TWENTY ONE OF A HANDBILL SHARPLY CRITICAL OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY
LJ029-0063 DISCUSSED IN CHAPTER 6 OF THIS REPORT
LJ029-0064 SHORTLY BEFORE THE DALLAS POLICE HAD REPORTED TO THE SECRET SERVICE THAT THE HANDBILL HAD APPEARED ON THE STREETS OF DALLAS
LJ029-0065 NEITHER THE DALLAS POLICE NOR THE FBI HAD YET LEARNED THE SOURCE OF THE HANDBILL
LJ029-0066 NO ONE ELSE WAS IDENTIFIED TO THE SECRET SERVICE THROUGH LOCAL INQUIRY AS POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS
LJ029-0067 NOR DID PRS DEVELOP ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BETWEEN NOVEMBER TWELVE WHEN LAWSON LEFT WASHINGTON AND NOVEMBER 22
LJ029-0068 THE ADEQUACY OF THE INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM MAINTAINED BY THE SECRET SERVICE AT THE TIME OF THE ASSASSINATION
LJ029-0069 INCLUDING A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE AVAILABLE DATA ON LEE HARVEY OSWALD AND THE REASONS WHY HIS NAME HAD NOT BEEN FURNISHED TO THE SECRET SERVICE
LJ029-0070 IS DISCUSSED IN CHAPTER 8
LJ029-0071 AN IMPORTANT PURPOSE OF THE PRESIDENT'S VISIT TO DALLAS WAS TO SPEAK AT A LUNCHEON GIVEN BY BUSINESS AND CIVIC LEADERS
LJ029-0072 THE WHITE HOUSE STAFF INFORMED THE SECRET SERVICE
LJ029-0073 THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD ARRIVE AND DEPART FROM DALLAS' LOVE FIELD THAT A MOTORCADE THROUGH THE DOWNTOWN AREA OF DALLAS TO THE LUNCHEON SITE SHOULD BE ARRANGED
LJ029-0074 AND THAT FOLLOWING THE LUNCHEON THE PRESIDENT WOULD RETURN TO THE AIRPORT BY THE MOST DIRECT ROUTE
LJ029-0075 ACCORDINGLY IT WAS IMPORTANT TO DETERMINE THE LUNCHEON SITE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO THAT SECURITY COULD BE ESTABLISHED AT THE SITE AND THE MOTORCADE ROUTE SELECTED
LJ029-0076 ON NOVEMBER FOURTH GERALD A. BEHN AGENT IN CHARGE OF THE WHITE HOUSE DETAIL ASKED SORRELS TO EXAMINE THREE POTENTIAL SITES FOR THE LUNCHEON
LJ029-0077 ONE BUILDING MARKET HALL WAS UNAVAILABLE FOR NOVEMBER 22
LJ029-0078 THE SECOND THE WOMEN'S BUILDING AT THE STATE FAIR GROUNDS
LJ029-0079 WAS A ONESTORY BUILDING WITH FEW ENTRANCES AND EASY TO MAKE SECURE BUT IT LACKED NECESSARY FOODHANDLING FACILITIES
LJ029-0080 AND HAD CERTAIN UNATTRACTIVE FEATURES INCLUDING A LOW CEILING WITH EXPOSED CONDUITS AND BEAMS
LJ029-0081 THE THIRD POSSIBILITY THE TRADE MART A HANDSOME NEW BUILDING WITH ALL THE NECESSARY FACILITIES PRESENTED SECURITY PROBLEMS. IT HAD NUMEROUS ENTRANCES
LJ029-0082 SEVERAL TIERS OF BALCONIES SURROUNDING THE CENTRAL COURT WHERE THE LUNCHEON WOULD BE HELD AND SEVERAL CATWALKS CROSSING THE COURT AT EACH LEVEL
LJ029-0083 ON NOVEMBER 4 SORRELS TOLD BEHN HE BELIEVED SECURITY DIFFICULTIES AT THE TRADE MART COULD BE OVERCOME BY SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS
LJ029-0084 LAWSON ALSO EVALUATED THE SECURITY HAZARDS AT THE TRADE MART ON NOVEMBER THIRTEEN
LJ029-0085 KENNETH O'DONNELL MADE THE FINAL DECISION TO HOLD THE LUNCHEON AT THE TRADE MART BEHN SO NOTIFIED LAWSON ON NOVEMBER FOURTEEN
LJ029-0086 ONCE THE TRADE MART HAD BEEN SELECTED SORRELS AND LAWSON WORKED OUT DETAILED ARRANGEMENTS FOR SECURITY AT THE BUILDING
LJ029-0087 IN ADDITION TO THE PREVENTIVE MEASURES ALREADY MENTIONED THEY PROVIDED FOR CONTROLLING ACCESS TO THE BUILDING CLOSING OFF AND POLICING AREAS AROUND IT
LJ029-0088 SECURING THE ROOF AND INSURING THE PRESENCE OF NUMEROUS POLICE OFFICERS INSIDE AND AROUND THE BUILDING
LJ029-0089 ULTIMATELY MORE THAN 200 LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS MAINLY DALLAS POLICE BUT INCLUDING 8 SECRET SERVICE AGENTS
LJ029-0090 WERE DEPLOYED IN AND AROUND THE TRADE MART
LJ029-0091 THE MOTORCADE ROUTE
LJ029-0092 ON NOVEMBER 8 WHEN LAWSON WAS BRIEFED ON THE ITINERARY FOR THE TRIP TO DALLAS
LJ029-0093 HE WAS TOLD THAT 45 MINUTES HAD BEEN ALLOTTED FOR A MOTORCADE PROCESSION FROM LOVE FIELD TO THE LUNCHEON SITE
LJ029-0094 LAWSON WAS NOT SPECIFICALLY INSTRUCTED TO SELECT THE PARADE ROUTE BUT HE UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS WAS ONE OF HIS FUNCTIONS
LJ029-0095 EVEN BEFORE THE TRADE MART HAD BEEN DEFINITELY SELECTED LAWSON AND SORRELS BEGAN TO CONSIDER THE BEST MOTORCADE ROUTE FROM LOVE FIELD TO THE TRADE MART
LJ029-0096 ON NOVEMBER FOURTEEN LAWSON AND SORRELS ATTENDED A MEETING AT LOVE FIELD
LJ029-0097 AND ON THEIR RETURN TO DALLAS DROVE OVER THE ROUTE WHICH SORRELS BELIEVED BEST SUITED FOR THE PROPOSED MOTORCADE
LJ029-0098 THIS ROUTE EVENTUALLY SELECTED FOR THE MOTORCADE FROM THE AIRPORT TO THE TRADE MART MEASURED TEN MILES AND COULD BE DRIVEN EASILY WITHIN THE ALLOTTED 45 MINUTES
LJ029-0099 FROM LOVE FIELD THE ROUTE PASSED THROUGH A PORTION OF SUBURBAN DALLAS
LJ029-0100 THROUGH THE DOWNTOWN AREA ALONG MAIN STREET AND THEN TO THE TRADE MART VIA STEMMONS FREEWAY
LJ029-0101 FOR THE PRESIDENT'S RETURN TO LOVE FIELD FOLLOWING THE LUNCHEON THE AGENTS SELECTED THE MOST DIRECT ROUTE WHICH WAS APPROXIMATELY 4 MILES
LJ029-0102 AFTER THE SELECTION OF THE TRADE MART AS THE LUNCHEON SITE
LJ029-0103 LAWSON AND SORRELS MET WITH DALLAS CHIEF OF POLICE JESSE E. CURRY ASSISTANT CHIEF CHARLES BATCHELOR
LJ029-0104 DEPUTY CHIEF N. T. FISHER AND SEVERAL OTHER COMMAND OFFICERS TO DISCUSS DETAILS OF THE MOTORCADE AND POSSIBLE ROUTES
LJ029-0105 THE ROUTE WAS FURTHER REVIEWED BY LAWSON AND SORRELS WITH ASSISTANT CHIEF BATCHELOR AND MEMBERS OF THE LOCAL HOST COMMITTEE ON NOVEMBER FIFTEEN
LJ029-0106 THE POLICE OFFICIALS AGREED THAT THE ROUTE RECOMMENDED BY SORRELS WAS THE PROPER ONE AND DID NOT EXPRESS A BELIEF THAT ANY OTHER ROUTE MIGHT BE BETTER
LJ029-0107 ON NOVEMBER EIGHTEEN
LJ029-0108 SORRELS AND LAWSON DROVE OVER THE SELECTED ROUTE WITH BATCHELOR AND OTHER POLICE OFFICERS VERIFYING THAT IT COULD BE TRAVERSED WITHIN 45 MINUTES
LJ029-0109 REPRESENTATIVES OF THE LOCAL HOST COMMITTEE AND THE WHITE HOUSE STAFF WERE ADVISED BY THE SECRET SERVICE OF THE ACTUAL ROUTE ON THE AFTERNOON OF NOVEMBER EIGHTEEN
LJ029-0110 THE ROUTE IMPRESSED THE AGENTS AS A NATURAL AND DESIRABLE ONE
LJ029-0111 SORRELS WHO HAD PARTICIPATED IN PRESIDENTIAL PROTECTION ASSIGNMENTS IN DALLAS SINCE A VISIT BY PRESIDENT FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT
LJ029-0112 IN 1936 AS TESTIFIED THAT THE TRADITIONAL PARADE ROUTE IN DALLAS WAS ALONG MAIN STREET SINCE THE TALL BUILDINGS ALONG THE STREET
LJ029-0113 GAVE MORE PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE
LJ029-0114 THE ROUTE CHOSEN FROM THE AIRPORT TO MAIN STREET WAS THE NORMAL ONE EXCEPT WHERE HARWOOD STREET WAS SELECTED AS THE MEANS OF ACCESS TO MAIN STREET
LJ029-0115 IN PREFERENCE TO A SHORT STRETCH OF THE CENTRAL EXPRESSWAY WHICH PRESENTED A MINOR SAFETY HAZARD
LJ029-0116 AND COULD NOT ACCOMMODATE SPECTATORS AS CONVENIENTLY AS HARWOOD STREET
LJ029-0117 ACCORDING TO LAWSON THE CHOSEN ROUTE SEEMED TO BE THE BEST
LJ029-0118 IT AFFORDED US WIDE STREETS MOST OF THE WAY BECAUSE OF THE BUSES THAT WERE IN THE MOTORCADE
LJ029-0119 IT AFFORDED US A CHANCE TO HAVE ALTERNATIVE ROUTES IF SOMETHING HAPPENED ON THE MOTORCADE ROUTE. IT WAS THE TYPE OF SUBURBAN AREA A GOOD PART OF THE WAY
LJ029-0120 WHERE THE CROWDS WOULD BE ABLE TO BE CONTROLLED FOR A GREAT DISTANCE AND WE FIGURED THAT THE LARGEST CROWDS WOULD BE DOWNTOWN WHICH THEY WERE
LJ029-0121 AND THAT THE WIDE STREETS THAT WE WOULD USE DOWNTOWN WOULD BE OF SUFFICIENT WIDTH TO KEEP THE PUBLIC OUT OF OUR WAY
LJ029-0122 ELM STREET PARALLEL TO MAIN STREET AND ONE BLOCK NORTH
LJ029-0123 WAS NOT USED FOR THE MAIN PORTION OF THE DOWNTOWN PART OF THE MOTORCADE BECAUSE MAIN STREET OFFERED BETTER VANTAGE POINTS FOR SPECTATORS
LJ029-0124 TO REACH THE TRADE MART FROM MAIN STREET THE AGENTS DECIDED TO USE THE STEMMONS FREEWAY ROUTE NO. 77 THE MOST DIRECT ROUTE
LJ029-0125 THE ONLY PRACTICAL WAY FOR WESTBOUND TRAFFIC ON MAIN STREET
LJ029-0126 TO REACH THE NORTHBOUND LANES OF THE STEMMONS FREEWAY IS VIA ELM STREET WHICH ROUTE NO. 77 TRAFFIC IS INSTRUCTED TO FOLLOW IN THIS PART OF THE CITY
LJ029-0127 ELM STREET WAS TO BE REACHED FROM MAIN BY TURNING RIGHT AT HOUSTON
LJ029-0128 GOING ONE BLOCK NORTH AND THEN TURNING LEFT ONTO ELM
LJ029-0129 ON THIS LAST PORTION OF THE JOURNEY ONLY 5 MINUTES FROM THE TRADE MART
LJ029-0130 THE PRESIDENT'S MOTORCADE WOULD PASS THE TEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY BUILDING ON THE NORTHWEST CORNER OF HOUSTON AND ELM STREETS
LJ029-0131 THE BUILDING OVERLOOKS DEALEY PLAZA AN ATTRACTIVELY LANDSCAPED TRIANGLE OF 3 ACRES
LJ029-0132 FROM HOUSTON STREET WHICH FORMS THE BASE OF THE TRIANGLE THREE STREETS  COMMERCE MAIN AND ELM 
LJ029-0133 TRISECT THE PLAZA CONVERGING AT THE APEX OF THE TRIANGLE TO FORM A TRIPLE UNDERPASS BENEATH A MULTIPLE RAILROAD BRIDGE
LJ029-0134 ALMOST 500 FEET FROM HOUSTON STREET
LJ029-0135 ELM STREET THE NORTHERNMOST OF THE THREE AFTER INTERSECTING HOUSTON CURVES IN A SOUTHWESTERLY ARC
LJ029-0136 THROUGH THE UNDERPASS AND LEADS INTO AN ACCESS ROAD
LJ029-0137 WHICH BRANCHES OFF TO THE RIGHT AND IS USED BY TRAFFIC GOING TO THE STEMMONS FREEWAY AND THE DALLASFORT WORTH TURNPIKE
LJ029-0138 THE ELM STREET APPROACH TO THE STEMMONS FREEWAY IS NECESSARY
LJ029-0139 IN ORDER TO AVOID THE TRAFFIC HAZARDS WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE EXIST IF RIGHT TURNS WERE PERMITTED FROM BOTH MAIN AND ELM INTO THE FREEWAY
LJ029-0140 TO CREATE THIS TRAFFIC PATTERN A CONCRETE BARRIER BETWEEN MAIN AND ELM STREETS PRESENTS AN OBSTACLE TO A RIGHT TURN
LJ029-0141 FROM MAIN ACROSS ELM TO THE ACCESS ROAD TO STEMMONS FREEWAY AND THE DALLASFORT WORTH TURNPIKE
LJ029-0142 THIS CONCRETE BARRIER EXTENDS FAR ENOUGH BEYOND THE ACCESS ROAD TO MAKE IT IMPRACTICABLE FOR VEHICLES TO TURN RIGHT FROM MAIN DIRECTLY TO THE ACCESS ROAD
LJ029-0143 A SIGN LOCATED ON THIS BARRIER INSTRUCTS MAIN STREET TRAFFIC NOT TO MAKE ANY TURNS
LJ029-0144 IN CONFORMITY WITH THESE ARRANGEMENTS TRAFFIC PROCEEDING WEST ON MAIN IS DIRECTED TO TURN RIGHT AT HOUSTON
LJ029-0145 IN ORDER TO REACH THE DALLASFORT WORTH TURNPIKE WHICH HAS THE SAME ACCESS ROAD FROM ELM STREET AS DOES THE STEMMONS FREEWAY
LJ029-0146 THE PLANNING FOR THE MOTORCADE ALSO INCLUDED ADVANCE PREPARATIONS FOR SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS ALONG THE ROUTE
LJ029-0147 SORRELS AND LAWSON REVIEWED THE ROUTE IN COOPERATION WITH ASSISTANT CHIEF BACHELOR AND OTHER DALLAS POLICE OFFICIALS WHO TOOK NOTES ON THE REQUIREMENTS
LJ029-0148 FOR CONTROLLING THE CROWDS AND TRAFFIC WATCHING THE OVERPASSES AND PROVIDING MOTORCYCLE ESCORT
LJ029-0149 TO CONTROL TRAFFIC ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE FOR THE DEPLOYMENT OF FOOT PATROLMEN AND MOTORCYCLE POLICE AT VARIOUS POSITIONS ALONG THE ROUTE
LJ029-0150 POLICE WERE ASSIGNED TO EACH OVERPASS ON THE ROUTE AND INSTRUCTED TO KEEP THEM CLEAR OF UNAUTHORIZED PERSONS
LJ029-0151 NO ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE FOR POLICE OR BUILDING CUSTODIANS
LJ029-0152 TO INSPECT BUILDINGS ALONG THE MOTORCADE ROUTE SINCE THE SECRET SERVICE DID NOT NORMALLY REQUEST OR MAKE SUCH A CHECK
LJ029-0153 UNDER STANDARD PROCEDURES THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WATCHING THE WINDOWS OF BUILDINGS WAS SHARED BY LOCAL POLICE STATIONED ALONG THE ROUTE
LJ029-0154 AND SECRET SERVICE AGENTS RIDING IN THE MOTORCADE
LJ029-0155 AS THE DATE FOR THE PRESIDENT'S VISIT APPROACHED
LJ029-0156 THE TWO DALLAS NEWSPAPERS CARRIED SEVERAL REPORTS OF HIS MOTORCADE ROUTE
LJ029-0157 THE SELECTION OF THE TRADE MART AS THE POSSIBLE SITE FOR THE LUNCHEON FIRST APPEARED IN THE DALLAS TIMESHERALD ON NOVEMBER 15 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ029-0158 THE FOLLOWING DAY THE NEWSPAPER REPORTED THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL PARTY
LJ029-0159 QUOTE APPARENTLY WILL LOOP THROUGH THE DOWNTOWN AREA PROBABLY ON MAIN STREET EN ROUTE FROM DALLAS LOVE FIELD END QUOTE
LJ029-0160 ON ITS WAY TO THE TRADE MART ON NOVEMBER NINETEEN THE TIMESHERALD AFTERNOON PAPER DETAILED THE PRECISE ROUTE
LJ029-0161 FROM THE AIRPORT THE PRESIDENT'S PARTY WILL PROCEED TO MOCKINGBIRD LANE TO LEMMON AND THEN TO TURTLE CREEK TURNING SOUTH TO CEDAR SPRINGS
LJ029-0162 THE MOTORCADE WILL THEN PASS THROUGH DOWNTOWN ON HARWOOD
LJ029-0163 AND THEN WEST ON MAIN TURNING BACK TO ELM AT HOUSTON AND THEN OUT STEMMONS FREEWAY TO THE TRADE MART
LJ029-0164 ALSO ON NOVEMBER NINETEEN THE MORNING NEWS REPORTED THAT THE PRESIDENT'S MOTORCADE WOULD TRAVEL FROM LOVE FIELD ALONG SPECIFIED STREETS THEN
LJ029-0165 HARWOOD TO MAIN MAIN TO HOUSTON HOUSTON TO ELM ELM UNDER THE TRIPLE UNDERPASS TO STEMMONS FREEWAY AND ON TO THE TRADE MART
LJ029-0166 ON NOVEMBER 20 A FRONT PAGE STORY REPORTED THAT THE STREETS ON WHICH THE PRESIDENTIAL MOTORCADE WOULD TRAVEL INCLUDED MAIN AND STEMMONS FREEWAY
LJ029-0167 ON THE MORNING OF THE PRESIDENT'S ARRIVAL
LJ029-0168 THE MORNING NEWS NOTED THAT THE MOTORCADE WOULD TRAVEL THROUGH DOWNTOWN DALLAS ONTO THE STEMMONS FREEWAY AND REPORTED THAT QUOTE THE MOTORCADE WILL MOVE SLOWLY
LJ029-0169 SO THAT CROWDS CAN GET A GOOD VIEW OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY AND HIS WIFE
LJ029-0170 DALLAS BEFORE THE VISIT
LJ029-0171 THE PRESIDENT'S INTENTION TO PAY A VISIT TO TEXAS IN THE FALL OF NINETEEN SIXTY THREE AROUSED INTEREST THROUGHOUT THE STATE
LJ029-0172 THE TWO DALLAS NEWSPAPERS PROVIDED THEIR READERS WITH A STEADY STREAM OF INFORMATION AND SPECULATION ABOUT THE TRIP
LJ029-0173 BEGINNING ON SEPTEMBER 13 WHEN THE TIMESHERALD ANNOUNCED IN A FRONT PAGE ARTICLE THAT PRESIDENT KENNEDY WAS PLANNING A BRIEF 1DAY TOUR OF FOUR TEXAS CITIES
LJ029-0174 DALLAS FORT WORTH SAN ANTONIO AND HOUSTON
LJ029-0175 BOTH DALLAS PAPERS CITED WHITE HOUSE SOURCES ON SEPTEMBER 26 AS CONFIRMING THE PRESIDENT'S INTENTION TO VISIT TEXAS ON NOVEMBER 21 AND 22
LJ029-0176 WITH DALLAS SCHEDULED AS ONE OF THE STOPS
LJ029-0177 ARTICLES EDITORIALS AND LETTERS TO THE EDITOR IN THE DALLAS MORNING NEWS AND THE DALLAS TIMESHERALD AFTER SEPTEMBER 13
LJ029-0178 REFLECTED THE FEELING IN THE COMMUNITY TOWARD THE FORTHCOMING PRESIDENTIAL VISIT
LJ029-0179 ALTHOUGH THERE WERE CRITICAL EDITORIALS AND LETTERS TO THE EDITORS THE NEWS STORIES REFLECTED THE DESIRE OF DALLAS OFFICIALS TO WELCOME THE PRESIDENT WITH DIGNITY AND COURTESY
LJ029-0180 AN EDITORIAL IN THE TIMESHERALD OF SEPTEMBER SEVENTEEN
LJ029-0181 CALLED ON THE PEOPLE OF DALLAS TO BE CONGENIAL HOSTS EVEN THOUGH DALLAS DIDN'T VOTE FOR MR. KENNEDY IN NINETEEN SIXTY
LJ029-0182 MAY NOT ENDORSE HIM IN '64
LJ029-0183 ON OCTOBER 3 THE DALLAS MORNING NEWS QUOTED U.S. REPRESENTATIVE JOE POOL'S HOPE
LJ029-0184 THAT PRESIDENT KENNEDY WOULD RECEIVE A GOOD WELCOME AND WOULD NOT FACE DEMONSTRATIONS LIKE THOSE ENCOUNTERED
LJ029-0185 BY VICE PRESIDENT JOHNSON DURING THE NINETEEN SIXTY CAMPAIGN
LJ029-0186 INCREASED CONCERN ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S VISIT WAS AROUSED BY THE INCIDENT INVOLVING THE U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS ADLAI E. STEVENSON
LJ029-0187 ON THE EVENING OF OCTOBER TWENTY FOUR NINETEEN SIXTY THREE AFTER ADDRESSING A MEETING IN DALLAS
LJ029-0188 STEVENSON WAS JEERED JOSTLED AND SPAT UPON BY HOSTILE DEMONSTRATORS OUTSIDE THE DALLAS MEMORIAL AUDITORIUM THEATER

LJ030-0239 YOUNGBLOOD WAS NOT POSITIVE THAT HE WAS IN THE REAR SEAT BEFORE THE SECOND SHOT BUT THOUGHT IT PROBABLE BECAUSE OF PRESIDENT JOHNSON'S STATEMENT

LJ031-0039 DR. CARRICO WAS IN THE EMERGENCY AREA EXAMINING ANOTHER PATIENT WHEN HE WAS NOTIFIED THAT PRESIDENT KENNEDY WAS EN ROUTE TO THE HOSPITAL
LJ031-0040 APPROXIMATELY 2 MINUTES LATER DR. CARRICO SAW THE PRESIDENT ON HIS BACK BEING WHEELED INTO THE EMERGENCY AREA
LJ031-0041 HE NOTED THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS BLUEWHITE OR ASHEN IN COLOR HAD SLOW SPASMODIC AGONAL RESPIRATION WITHOUT ANY COORDINATION

LJ031-0043 EVIDENCED NO PALPABLE PULSE AND HAD A FEW CHEST SOUNDS WHICH WERE THOUGHT TO BE HEARTBEATS
LJ031-0044 ON THE BASIS OF THESE FINDINGS DR. CARRICO CONCLUDED THAT PRESIDENT KENNEDY WAS STILL ALIVE
LJ031-0045 DR. CARRICO NOTED TWO WOUNDS A SMALL BULLET WOUND IN THE FRONT LOWER NECK
LJ031-0046 AND AN EXTENSIVE WOUND IN THE PRESIDENT'S HEAD WHERE A SIZABLE PORTION OF THE SKULL WAS MISSING

LJ031-0049 DR. CARRICO FELT THE PRESIDENT'S BACK AND DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS NO LARGE WOUND THERE WHICH WOULD BE AN IMMEDIATE THREAT TO LIFE
LJ031-0050 OBSERVING THE SERIOUS PROBLEMS PRESENTED BY THE HEAD WOUND AND INADEQUATE RESPIRATION DR. CARRICO DIRECTED HIS ATTENTION TO IMPROVING THE PRESIDENT'S BREATHING
LJ031-0051 HE NOTED CONTUSIONS HEMATOMA TO THE RIGHT OF THE LARYNX WHICH WAS DEVIATED SLIGHTLY TO THE LEFT
LJ031-0052 AND ALSO RAGGED TISSUE WHICH INDICATED A TRACHEAL INJURY
LJ031-0053 DR. CARRICO INSERTED A CUFFED ENDOTRACHEAL TUBE PAST THE INJURY INFLATED THE CUFF AND CONNECTED IT TO A BENNETT MACHINE TO ASSIST IN RESPIRATION
LJ031-0054 AT THAT POINT DIRECTION OF THE PRESIDENT'S TREATMENT WAS UNDERTAKEN BY DR. MALCOLM O. PERRY WHO ARRIVED AT TRAUMA ROOM 1 A FEW MOMENTS AFTER THE PRESIDENT
LJ031-0055 DR. PERRY NOTED THE PRESIDENT'S BACK BRACE AS HE FELT FOR A FEMORAL PULSE WHICH HE DID NOT FIND
LJ031-0056 OBSERVING THAT AN EFFECTIVE AIRWAY HAD TO BE ESTABLISHED IF TREATMENT WAS TO BE EFFECTIVE DR. PERRY PERFORMED A TRACHEOTOMY WHICH REQUIRED 3 TO 5 MINUTES
LJ031-0057 WHILE DR. PERRY WAS PERFORMING THE TRACHEOTOMY DRS. CARRICO AND RONALD JONES MADE CUTDOWNS ON THE PRESIDENT'S RIGHT LEG AND LEFT ARM RESPECTIVELY
LJ031-0058 TO INFUSE BLOOD AND FLUIDS INTO THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
LJ031-0059 DR. CARRICO TREATED THE PRESIDENT'S KNOWN ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY BY ADMINISTERING HYDROCORTISONE
LJ031-0060 DR. ROBERT N. MCCLELLAND ENTERED AT THAT POINT AND ASSISTED DR. PERRY WITH THE TRACHEOTOMY
LJ031-0061 DR. FOUAD BASHOUR CHIEF OF CARDIOLOGY DR. M. T. JENKINS CHIEF OF ANESTHESIOLOGY AND DR. A. H. GIESECKE JR
LJ031-0062 THEN JOINED IN THE EFFORT TO REVIVE THE PRESIDENT
LJ031-0063 WHEN DR. PERRY NOTED FREE AIR AND BLOOD IN THE PRESIDENT'S CHEST CAVITY HE ASKED THAT CHEST TUBES BE INSERTED TO ALLOW FOR DRAINAGE OF BLOOD AND AIR
LJ031-0064 DRS. PAUL C. PETERS AND CHARLES R. BAXTER INITIATED THESE PROCEDURES
LJ031-0065 AS A RESULT OF THE INFUSION OF LIQUIDS THROUGH THE CUTDOWNS THE CARDIAC MASSAGE AND THE AIRWAY
LJ031-0066 THE DOCTORS WERE ABLE TO MAINTAIN PERIPHERAL CIRCULATION AS MONITORED AT THE NECK CAROTID ARTERY AND AT THE WRIST RADIAL PULSE
LJ031-0067 A FEMORAL PULSE WAS ALSO DETECTED IN THE PRESIDENT'S LEG
LJ031-0068 WHILE THESE MEDICAL EFFORTS WERE IN PROGRESS
LJ031-0069 DR. CLARK NOTED SOME ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY ON THE CARDIOTACHYSCOPE ATTACHED TO MONITOR THE PRESIDENT'S HEART RESPONSES
LJ031-0070 DR. CLARK WHO MOST CLOSELY OBSERVED THE HEAD WOUND

LJ031-0072 DR. CLARK DID NOT SEE ANY OTHER HOLE OR WOUND ON THE PRESIDENT'S HEAD
LJ031-0073 ACCORDING TO DR. CLARK THE SMALL BULLET HOLE ON THE RIGHT REAR OF THE PRESIDENT'S HEAD DISCOVERED DURING THE SUBSEQUENT AUTOPSY
LJ031-0074 QUOTE COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN HIDDEN IN THE BLOOD AND HAIR END QUOTE
LJ031-0075 IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY NEUROLOGICAL MUSCULAR OR HEART RESPONSE THE DOCTORS CONCLUDED THAT EFFORTS TO REVIVE THE PRESIDENT WERE HOPELESS
LJ031-0076 THIS WAS VERIFIED BY ADMIRAL BURKLEY THE PRESIDENT'S PHYSICIAN WHO ARRIVED AT THE HOSPITAL AFTER EMERGENCY TREATMENT WAS UNDERWAY AND CONCLUDED THAT QUOTE
LJ031-0077 MY DIRECT SERVICES TO HIM AT THAT MOMENT WOULD HAVE INTERFERED WITH THE ACTION OF THE TEAM WHICH WAS IN PROGRESS END QUOTE
LJ031-0078 AT APPROXIMATELY ONE P.M. AFTER LAST RITES WERE ADMINISTERED TO THE PRESIDENT BY FATHER OSCAR L. HUBER DR. CLARK PRONOUNCED THE PRESIDENT DEAD
LJ031-0079 HE MADE THE OFFICIAL DETERMINATION BECAUSE THE ULTIMATE CAUSE OF DEATH THE SEVERE HEAD INJURY WAS WITHIN HIS SPHERE OF SPECIALIZATION
LJ031-0080 THE TIME WAS FIXED AT 1 P.M. AS AN APPROXIMATION SINCE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE PRECISE MOMENT WHEN LIFE LEFT THE PRESIDENT
LJ031-0081 PRESIDENT KENNEDY COULD HAVE SURVIVED THE NECK INJURY BUT THE HEAD WOUND WAS FATAL
LJ031-0082 FROM A MEDICAL VIEWPOINT PRESIDENT KENNEDY WAS ALIVE WHEN HE ARRIVED AT PARKLAND HOSPITAL
LJ031-0083 THE DOCTORS OBSERVED THAT HE HAD A HEARTBEAT AND WAS MAKING SOME RESPIRATORY EFFORTS
LJ031-0084 BUT HIS CONDITION WAS HOPELESS AND THE EXTRAORDINARY EFFORTS OF THE DOCTORS TO SAVE HIM COULD NOT HELP BUT TO HAVE BEEN UNAVAILING
LJ031-0085 SINCE THE DALLAS DOCTORS DIRECTED ALL THEIR EFFORTS TO CONTROLLING THE MASSIVE BLEEDING CAUSED BY THE HEAD WOUND AND TO RECONSTRUCTING AN AIRWAY TO HIS LUNGS
LJ031-0086 THE PRESIDENT REMAINED ON HIS BACK THROUGHOUT HIS MEDICAL TREATMENT AT PARKLAND
LJ031-0087 WHEN ASKED WHY HE DID NOT TURN THE PRESIDENT OVER DR. CARRICO TESTIFIED AS FOLLOWS
LJ031-0088 THIS MAN WAS IN OBVIOUS EXTREME DISTRESS AND ANY MORE THOROUGH INSPECTION WOULD HAVE INVOLVED SEVERAL MINUTES  WELL SEVERAL
LJ031-0089 CONSIDERABLE TIME WHICH AT THIS JUNCTURE WAS NOT AVAILABLE
LJ031-0090 A THOROUGH INSPECTION WOULD HAVE INVOLVED WASHING AND CLEANSING THE BACK AND THIS IS NOT PRACTICAL IN TREATING AN ACUTELY INJURED PATIENT
LJ031-0091 YOU HAVE TO DETERMINE WHICH THINGS WHICH ARE IMMEDIATELY LIFE THREATENING AND COPE WITH THEM BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO EVALUATE THE FULL EXTENT OF THE INJURIES
LJ031-0092 DID YOU EVER HAVE OCCASION TO LOOK AT THE PRESIDENT'S BACK
LJ031-0093 ANSWER NO SIR. BEFORE  WELL IN TRYING TO TREAT AN ACUTELY INJURED PATIENT YOU HAVE TO ESTABLISH AN AIRWAY ADEQUATE VENTILATION
LJ031-0094 AND YOU HAVE TO ESTABLISH ADEQUATE CIRCULATION
LJ031-0095 BEFORE THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED THE PRESIDENT'S CARDIAC ACTIVITY HAD CEASED AND CLOSED CARDIAC MASSAGE WAS INSTITUTED WHICH MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO INSPECT HIS BACK
LJ031-0096 QUESTION WAS ANY EFFORT MADE TO INSPECT THE PRESIDENT'S BACK AFTER HE HAD EXPIRED ANSWER NO SIR
LJ031-0097 QUESTION AND WHY WAS NO EFFORT MADE AT THAT TIME TO INSPECT HIS BACK ANSWER
LJ031-0098 I SUPPOSE NOBODY REALLY HAD THE HEART TO DO IT
LJ031-0099 MOREOVER THE PARKLAND DOCTORS TOOK NO FURTHER ACTION AFTER THE PRESIDENT HAD EXPIRED BECAUSE THEY CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THEIR PERMISSIBLE DUTIES

LJ032-0063 SINCE THE RIFLE WAS SHIPPED FROM CHICAGO ON MARCH 20 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE IT WAS RECEIVED IN DALLAS DURING THE PERIOD WHEN OSWALD RENTED AND USED THE BOX
LJ032-0064 IT IS NOT KNOWN WHETHER THE APPLICATION FOR POST OFFICE BOX 2915 LISTED A. HIDELL AS A PERSON ENTITLED TO RECEIVE MAIL AT THIS BOX

LJ032-0091 THERE IS NO DR. HIDEEL LICENSED TO PRACTICE MEDICINE IN LOUISIANA
LJ032-0092 THERE IS NO POST OFFICE BOX 30016 IN THE NEW ORLEANS POST OFFICE
LJ032-0093 BUT OSWALD HAD RENTED POST OFFICE BOX 30061 IN NEW ORLEANS ON JUNE 3 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ032-0094 LISTING MARINA OSWALD AND A. J. HIDELL
LJ032-0095 AS ADDITIONAL PERSONS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE MAIL IN THE BOX. THE NEW ORLEANS POSTAL AUTHORITIES HAD NOT DISCARDED THE PORTION OF THE APPLICATION
LJ032-0096 LISTING THE NAMES OF THOSE OTHER THAN THE OWNER OF THE BOX ENTITLED TO RECEIVE MAIL THROUGH THE BOX
LJ032-0097 EXPERT TESTIMONY CONFIRMED THAT THE WRITING ON THIS APPLICATION WAS THAT OF LEE HARVEY OSWALD
LJ032-0098 HIDELL'S NAME ON THE POST OFFICE BOX APPLICATION WAS PART OF OSWALD'S USE OF A NONEXISTENT HIDELL
LJ032-0099 TO SERVE AS PRESIDENT OF THE SOCALLED NEW ORLEANS CHAPTER OF THE FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE
LJ032-0100 MARINA OSWALD
LJ032-0101 TESTIFIED THAT SHE FIRST LEARNED OF OSWALD'S USE OF THE FICTITIOUS NAME HIDELL IN CONNECTION WITH HIS PROCASTRO ACTIVITIES IN NEW ORLEANS
LJ032-0102 ACCORDING TO HER TESTIMONY HE COMPELLED HER TO WRITE THE NAME HIDELL ON MEMBERSHIP CARDS IN THE SPACE DESIGNATED FOR THE SIGNATURE OF THE CHAPTER PRESIDENT
LJ032-0103 THE NAME HIDELL WAS STAMPED ON SOME OF THE CHAPTER'S PRINTED LITERATURE AND ON THE MEMBERSHIP APPLICATION BLANKS
LJ032-0104 MARINA OSWALD TESTIFIED
LJ032-0105 QUOTE I KNEW THERE WAS NO SUCH ORGANIZATION. AND I KNOW HIDELL IS MERELY AN ALTERED FIDEL AND I LAUGHED AT SUCH FOOLISHNESS
LJ032-0106 END QUOTE. HIDELL WAS A FICTITIOUS PRESIDENT OF AN ORGANIZATION OF WHICH OSWALD WAS THE ONLY MEMBER
LJ032-0107 WHEN SEEKING EMPLOYMENT IN NEW ORLEANS
LJ032-0108 OSWALD LISTED A SGT. ROBERT HIDELL AS A REFERENCE ON ONE JOB APPLICATION AND GEORGE HIDELL AS A REFERENCE ON ANOTHER
LJ032-0109 BOTH NAMES WERE FOUND TO BE FICTITIOUS
LJ032-0110 MOREOVER THE USE OF ALEK AS A FIRST NAME FOR HIDELL IS A FURTHER LINK TO OSWALD BECAUSE ALEK WAS OSWALD'S NICKNAME IN RUSSIA
LJ032-0111 LETTERS RECEIVED BY MARINA OSWALD FROM HER HUSBAND SIGNED ALEK WERE GIVEN TO THE COMMISSION
LJ032-0112 OSWALD'S PALMPRINT ON RIFLE BARREL
LJ032-0113 BASED ON THE ABOVE EVIDENCE THE COMMISSION CONCLUDED THAT OSWALD PURCHASED THE RIFLE FOUND ON THE SIXTH FLOOR OF THE DEPOSITORY BUILDING
LJ032-0114 ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE OF OWNERSHIP WAS PROVIDED IN THE FORM OF PALMPRINT IDENTIFICATION WHICH INDICATED THAT OSWALD HAD POSSESSION OF THE RIFLE HE HAD PURCHASED
LJ032-0115 A FEW MINUTES AFTER THE RIFLE WAS DISCOVERED ON THE SIXTH FLOOR OF THE DEPOSITORY BUILDING
LJ032-0116 IT WAS EXAMINED BY LT. J. C. DAY OF THE IDENTIFICATION BUREAU OF THE DALLAS POLICE
LJ032-0117 HE LIFTED THE RIFLE BY THE WOODEN STOCK AFTER HIS EXAMINATION CONVINCED HIM THAT THE WOOD WAS TOO ROUGH TO TAKE FINGERPRINTS
LJ032-0118 CAPT. J. W. FRITZ THEN EJECTED A CARTRIDGE BY OPERATING THE BOLT
LJ032-0119 BUT ONLY AFTER DAY VIEWED THE KNOB ON THE BOLT THROUGH A MAGNIFYING GLASS AND FOUND NO PRINTS
LJ032-0120 DAY CONTINUED TO EXAMINE THE RIFLE WITH THE MAGNIFYING GLASS LOOKING FOR POSSIBLE FINGERPRINTS
LJ032-0121 HE APPLIED FINGERPRINT POWDER TO THE SIDE OF THE METAL HOUSING NEAR THE TRIGGER AND NOTICED TRACES OF TWO PRINTS
LJ032-0122 AT 1145 P.M. ON NOVEMBER TWENTY TWO
LJ032-0123 THE RIFLE WAS RELEASED TO THE FBI AND FORWARDED TO WASHINGTON WHERE IT WAS EXAMINED ON THE MORNING OF NOVEMBER 23
LJ032-0124 BY SEBASTIAN F. LATONA SUPERVISOR OF THE LATENT FINGERPRINT SECTION OF THE FBI'S IDENTIFICATION DIVISION
LJ032-0125 IN HIS TESTIMONY BEFORE THE COMMISSION LATONA STATED THAT WHEN HE RECEIVED THE RIFLE THE AREA WHERE PRINTS WERE VISIBLE WAS PROTECTED BY CELLOPHANE
LJ032-0126 HE EXAMINED THESE PRINTS AS WELL AS PHOTOGRAPHS OF THEM WHICH THE DALLAS POLICE HAD MADE AND CONCLUDED THAT
LJ032-0127 THE FORMATIONS THE RIDGE FORMATIONS AND CHARACTERISTICS WERE INSUFFICIENT FOR PURPOSES OF EITHER EFFECTING IDENTIFICATION
LJ032-0128 OR A DETERMINATION THAT THE PRINT WAS NOT IDENTICAL WITH THE PRINTS OF PEOPLE
LJ032-0129 ACCORDINGLY MY OPINION SIMPLY WAS THAT THE LATENT PRINTS WHICH WERE THERE WERE OF NO VALUE END QUOTE
LJ032-0130 LATONA THEN PROCESSED THE COMPLETE WEAPON BUT DEVELOPED NO IDENTIFIABLE PRINTS
LJ032-0131 HE STATED THAT THE POOR QUALITY OF THE WOOD AND THE METAL WOULD CAUSE THE RIFLE TO ABSORB MOISTURE FROM THE SKIN THEREBY MAKING A CLEAR PRINT UNLIKELY
LJ032-0132 ON NOVEMBER 22 HOWEVER BEFORE SURRENDERING POSSESSION OF THE RIFLE TO THE FBI LABORATORY
LJ032-0133 LIEUTENANT DAY OF THE DALLAS POLICE DEPARTMENT HAD LIFTED A PALMPRINT FROM THE UNDERSIDE OF THE GUN BARREL
LJ032-0134 QUOTE NEAR THE FIRING END OF THE BARREL ABOUT 3 INCHES UNDER THE WOODSTOCK WHEN I TOOK THE WOODSTOCK LOOSE END QUOTE
LJ032-0135 LIFTING A PRINT INVOLVES THE USE OF ADHESIVE MATERIAL TO REMOVE THE FINGERPRINT POWDER WHICH ADHERES TO THE ORIGINAL PRINT
LJ032-0136 IN THIS WAY THE POWDERED IMPRESSION IS ACTUALLY REMOVED FROM THE OBJECT
LJ032-0137 THE LIFTING HAD BEEN SO COMPLETE IN THIS CASE THAT THERE WAS NO TRACE OF THE PRINT ON THE RIFLE ITSELF WHEN IT WAS EXAMINED BY LATONA
LJ032-0138 NOR WAS THERE ANY INDICATION THAT THE LIFT HAD BEEN PERFORMED
LJ032-0139 DAY ON THE OTHER HAND BELIEVED THAT SUFFICIENT TRACES OF THE PRINT HAD BEEN LEFT ON THE RIFLE BARREL
LJ032-0140 BECAUSE HE DID NOT RELEASE THE LIFTED PRINT UNTIL NOVEMBER 26 WHEN HE RECEIVED INSTRUCTIONS TO SEND EVERYTHING THAT WE HAD TO THE FBI
LJ032-0141 THE PRINT ARRIVED IN THE FBI LABORATORY IN WASHINGTON ON NOVEMBER 29 MOUNTED ON A CARD ON WHICH LIEUTENANT DAY HAD WRITTEN THE WORDS
LJ032-0142 QUOTE OFF UNDERSIDE GUN BARREL NEAR END OF GRIP C2766 END QUOTE
LJ032-0143 THE PRINT'S POSITIVE IDENTITY AS HAVING BEEN LIFTED FROM THE RIFLE
LJ032-0144 WAS CONFIRMED BY FBI LABORATORY TESTS WHICH ESTABLISHED THAT THE ADHESIVE MATERIAL BEARING THE PRINT
LJ032-0145 ALSO BORE IMPRESSIONS OF THE SAME IRREGULARITIES THAT APPEARED ON THE BARREL OF THE RIFLE
LJ032-0146 LATONA TESTIFIED THAT THIS PALMPRINT WAS THE RIGHT PALMPRINT OF LEE HARVEY OSWALD
LJ032-0147 AT THE REQUEST OF THE COMMISSION ARTHUR MANDELLA
LJ032-0148 FINGERPRINT EXPERT WITH THE NEW YORK CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT CONDUCTED AN INDEPENDENT EXAMINATION AND ALSO DETERMINED THAT THIS WAS THE RIGHT PALMPRINT OF OSWALD
LJ032-0149 LATONA'S FINDINGS WERE ALSO CONFIRMED BY RONALD G. WITTMUS ANOTHER FBI FINGERPRINT EXPERT
LJ032-0150 IN THE OPINION OF THESE EXPERTS IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO ESTIMATE THE TIME WHICH ELAPSED BETWEEN THE PLACING OF THE PRINT ON THE RIFLE AND THE DATE OF THE LIFT
LJ032-0151 EXPERTS TESTIFYING BEFORE THE COMMISSION AGREED THAT PALMPRINTS ARE AS UNIQUE AS FINGERPRINTS FOR PURPOSES OF ESTABLISHING IDENTIFICATION
LJ032-0152 OSWALD'S PALMPRINT ON THE UNDERSIDE OF THE BARREL DEMONSTRATES THAT HE HANDLED THE RIFLE WHEN IT WAS DISASSEMBLED
LJ032-0153 A PALMPRINT COULD NOT BE PLACED ON THIS PORTION OF THE RIFLE WHEN ASSEMBLED BECAUSE THE WOODEN FOREGRIP COVERS THE BARREL AT THIS POINT
LJ032-0154 THE PRINT IS ADDITIONAL PROOF THAT THE RIFLE WAS IN OSWALD'S POSSESSION
LJ032-0155 FIBERS ON RIFLE
LJ032-0156 IN A CREVICE BETWEEN THE BUTT PLATE OF THE RIFLE AND THE WOODEN STOCK
LJ032-0157 WAS A TUFT OF SEVERAL COTTON FIBERS OF DARK BLUE GRAYBLACK AND ORANGEYELLOW SHADES
LJ032-0158 ON NOVEMBER TWENTY THREE NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ032-0159 THESE FIBERS WERE EXAMINED BY PAUL M. STOMBAUGH A SPECIAL AGENT ASSIGNED TO THE HAIR AND FIBER UNIT OF THE FBI LABORATORY
LJ032-0160 HE COMPARED THEM WITH THE FIBERS FOUND IN THE SHIRT WHICH OSWALD WAS WEARING WHEN ARRESTED IN THE TEXAS THEATRE
LJ032-0161 THIS SHIRT WAS ALSO COMPOSED OF DARK BLUE GRAY BLACK AND ORANGEYELLOW COTTON FIBERS
LJ032-0162 STOMBAUGH TESTIFIED THAT THE COLORS SHADES AND TWIST OF THE FIBERS FOUND IN THE TUFT ON THE RIFLE MATCHED THOSE IN OSWALD'S SHIRT
LJ032-0163 STOMBAUGH EXPLAINED IN HIS TESTIMONY THAT IN FIBER ANALYSIS AS DISTINCT FROM FINGERPRINT OR FIREARMS IDENTIFICATION
LJ032-0164 IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO STATE WITH SCIENTIFIC CERTAINTY THAT A PARTICULAR SMALL GROUP OF FIBERS COME FROM A CERTAIN PIECE OF CLOTHING
LJ032-0165 TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL OTHERS BECAUSE THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH MICROSCOPIC CHARACTERISTICS PRESENT IN FIBERS
LJ032-0166 JUDGMENTS AS TO PROBABILITY WILL DEPEND ON THE NUMBER AND TYPES OF MATCHES
LJ032-0167 HE CONCLUDED QUOTE THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT THESE FIBERS COULD HAVE COME FROM THIS SHIRT
LJ032-0168 THERE IS NO WAY HOWEVER TO ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITY OF THE FIBERS HAVING COME FROM ANOTHER IDENTICAL SHIRT END QUOTE
LJ032-0169 HAVING CONSIDERED THE PROBABILITIES AS EXPLAINED IN STOMBAUGH'S TESTIMONY
LJ032-0170 THE COMMISSION HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE FIBERS IN THE TUFT ON THE RIFLE MOST PROBABLY CAME FROM THE SHIRT WORN BY OSWALD WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED
LJ032-0171 AND THAT THIS WAS THE SAME SHIRT WHICH OSWALD WORE ON THE MORNING OF THE ASSASSINATION
LJ032-0172 MARINA OSWALD TESTIFIED THAT SHE THOUGHT HER HUSBAND WORE THIS SHIRT TO WORK ON THAT DAY
LJ032-0173 THE TESTIMONY OF THOSE WHO SAW HIM AFTER THE ASSASSINATION WAS INCONCLUSIVE ABOUT THE COLOR OF OSWALD'S SHIRT
LJ032-0174 BUT MARY BLEDSOE A FORMER LANDLADY OF OSWALD SAW HIM ON A BUS APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES AFTER THE ASSASSINATION
LJ032-0175 AND IDENTIFIED THE SHIRT AS BEING THE ONE WORN BY OSWALD PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF A DISTINCTIVE HOLE IN THE SHIRT'S RIGHT ELBOW
LJ032-0176 MOREOVER THE BUS TRANSFER WHICH HE OBTAINED AS HE LEFT THE BUS WAS STILL IN THE POCKET WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED
LJ032-0177 ALTHOUGH OSWALD RETURNED TO HIS ROOMINGHOUSE AFTER THE ASSASSINATION AND WHEN QUESTIONED BY THE POLICE CLAIMED TO HAVE CHANGED HIS SHIRT
LJ032-0178 THE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT HE CONTINUED WEARING THE SAME SHIRT WHICH HE WAS WEARING ALL MORNING AND WHICH HE WAS STILL WEARING WHEN ARRESTED
LJ032-0179 IN LIGHT OF THESE FINDINGS THE COMMISSION EVALUATED THE ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY OF STOMBAUGH
LJ032-0180 THAT THE FIBERS WERE CAUGHT IN THE CREVICE OF THE RIFLE'S BUTT PLATE QUOTE IN THE RECENT PAST END QUOTE
LJ032-0181 ALTHOUGH STOMBAUGH WAS UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE PERIOD OF TIME THE FIBERS WERE ON THE RIFLE HE SAID THAT THE FIBERS QUOTE
LJ032-0182 WERE CLEAN THEY HAD GOOD COLOR TO THEM THERE WAS NO GREASE ON THEM AND THEY WERE NOT FRAGMENTED THEY LOOKED AS IF THEY HAD JUST BEEN PICKED UP END QUOTE
LJ032-0183 THE RELATIVE FRESHNESS OF THE FIBERS IS STRONG EVIDENCE THAT THEY WERE CAUGHT ON THE RIFLE ON THE MORNING OF THE ASSASSINATION OR DURING THE PRECEDING EVENING
LJ032-0184 FOR 10 DAYS PRIOR TO THE EVE OF THE ASSASSINATION OSWALD HAD NOT BEEN PRESENT AT RUTH PAINE'S HOUSE IN IRVING TEXAS WHERE THE RIFLE WAS KEPT
LJ032-0185 MOREOVER THE COMMISSION FOUND NO RELIABLE EVIDENCE THAT OSWALD USED THE RIFLE AT ANY TIME BETWEEN SEPTEMBER TWENTY THREE
LJ032-0186 WHEN IT WAS TRANSPORTED FROM NEW ORLEANS AND NOVEMBER 22 THE DAY OF THE ASSASSINATION
LJ032-0187 THE FACT THAT ON THE MORNING OF THE ASSASSINATION OSWALD WAS WEARING THE SHIRT FROM WHICH THESE RELATIVELY FRESH FIBERS MOST PROBABLY ORIGINATED
LJ032-0188 PROVIDES SOME EVIDENCE THAT THEY WERE PLACED ON THE RIFLE THAT DAY
LJ032-0189 SINCE THERE WAS LIMITED IF ANY OPPORTUNITY FOR OSWALD TO HANDLE THE WEAPON DURING THE 2 MONTHS PRIOR TO NOVEMBER TWENTY TWO
LJ032-0190 ON THE OTHER HAND STOMBAUGH POINTED OUT THAT FIBERS MIGHT RETAIN THEIR FRESHNESS IF THE RIFLE HAD BEEN
LJ032-0191 QUOTE PUT ASIDE END QUOTE AFTER CATCHING THE FIBERS
LJ032-0192 THE RIFLE USED IN THE ASSASSINATION PROBABLY HAD BEEN WRAPPED IN A BLANKET FOR ABOUT EIGHT WEEKS PRIOR TO NOVEMBER TWENTY TWO
LJ032-0193 BECAUSE THE RELATIVE FRESHNESS OF THESE FIBERS MIGHT BE EXPLAINED BY THE CONTINUOUS STORAGE OF THE RIFLE IN THE BLANKET
LJ032-0194 THE COMMISSION WAS UNABLE TO REACH ANY FIRM CONCLUSION AS TO WHEN THE FIBERS WERE CAUGHT IN THE RIFLE
LJ032-0195 THE COMMISSION WAS ABLE TO CONCLUDE HOWEVER THAT THE FIBERS MOST PROBABLY CAME FROM OSWALD'S SHIRT
LJ032-0196 THIS ADDS TO THE CONVICTION OF THE COMMISSION THAT OSWALD OWNED AND HANDLED THE WEAPON USED IN THE ASSASSINATION
LJ032-0197 PHOTOGRAPH OF OSWALD WITH RIFLE
LJ032-0198 DURING THE PERIOD FROM MARCH TWO NINETEEN SIXTY THREE TO APRIL TWENTY FOUR NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ032-0199 THE OSWALDS LIVED ON NEELY STREET IN DALLAS IN A RENTED HOUSE WHICH HAD A SMALL BACK YARD
LJ032-0200 ONE SUNDAY WHILE HIS WIFE WAS HANGING DIAPERS OSWALD ASKED HER TO TAKE A PICTURE OF HIM HOLDING A RIFLE A PISTOL
LJ032-0201 AND ISSUES OF TWO NEWSPAPERS LATER IDENTIFIED AS THE WORKER AND THE MILITANT
LJ032-0202 TWO PICTURES WERE TAKEN. THE COMMISSION HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE RIFLE SHOWN IN THESE PICTURES IS THE SAME RIFLE WHICH WAS FOUND ON THE SIXTH FLOOR OF THE DEPOSITORY BUILDING
LJ032-0203 ON NOVEMBER 22 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE. ONE OF THESE PICTURES EXHIBIT NO. 133A SHOWS MOST OF THE RIFLE'S CONFIGURATION
LJ032-0204 SPECIAL AGENT LYNDAL L. SHANEYFELT A PHOTOGRAPHY EXPERT WITH THE FBI
LJ032-0205 PHOTOGRAPHED THE RIFLE USED IN THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTING TO DUPLICATE THE POSITION OF THE RIFLE AND THE LIGHTING IN EXHIBIT NO. 133A
LJ032-0206 AFTER COMPARING THE RIFLE IN THE SIMULATED PHOTOGRAPH WITH THE RIFLE IN EXHIBIT NO. 133A SHANEYFELT TESTIFIED QUOTE
LJ032-0207 I FOUND IT TO BE THE SAME GENERAL CONFIGURATION. ALL APPEARANCES WERE THE SAME END QUOTE
LJ032-0208 HE FOUND QUOTE ONE NOTCH IN THE STOCK AT THIS POINT THAT APPEARS VERY FAINTLY IN THE PHOTOGRAPH END QUOTE
LJ032-0209 HE STATED HOWEVER THAT WHILE HE QUOTE FOUND NO DIFFERENCES END QUOTE BETWEEN THE RIFLES IN THE TWO PHOTOGRAPHS HE COULD NOT MAKE A QUOTE POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION
LJ032-0210 TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL OTHER RIFLES OF THE SAME GENERAL CONFIGURATION END QUOTE
LJ032-0211 THE AUTHENTICITY OF THESE PICTURES HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED BY EXPERT TESTIMONY WHICH LINKS THE SECOND PICTURE
LJ032-0212 COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 133B TO OSWALD'S IMPERIAL REFLEX CAMERA WITH WHICH MARINA OSWALD TESTIFIED SHE TOOK THE PICTURES
LJ032-0213 THE NEGATIVE OF THAT PICTURE COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 133B WAS FOUND AMONG OSWALD'S POSSESSIONS
LJ032-0214 USING A RECOGNIZED TECHNIQUE OF DETERMINING WHETHER A PICTURE WAS TAKEN WITH A PARTICULAR CAMERA
LJ032-0215 SHANEYFELT COMPARED THIS NEGATIVE WITH A NEGATIVE WHICH HE MADE BY TAKING A NEW PICTURE WITH OSWALD'S CAMERA
LJ032-0216 HE CONCLUDED THAT THE NEGATIVE OF EXHIBIT NO. 133B WAS EXPOSED IN OSWALD'S IMPERIAL REFLEX CAMERA TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL OTHER CAMERAS
LJ032-0217 HE COULD NOT TEST EXHIBIT NO. 133A IN THE SAME WAY BECAUSE THE NEGATIVE WAS NEVER RECOVERED
LJ032-0218 BOTH PICTURES HOWEVER HAVE IDENTICAL BACKGROUNDS AND LIGHTING AND JUDGING FROM THE SHADOWS WERE TAKEN AT THE SAME ANGLE
LJ032-0219 THEY ARE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE SAME SCENE
LJ032-0220 SINCE EXHIBIT NO. 133B WAS TAKEN WITH OSWALD'S CAMERA
LJ032-0221 IT IS REASONABLY CERTAIN THAT EXHIBIT NO. 133A WAS TAKEN BY THE SAME CAMERA AT THE SAME TIME AS MARINA OSWALD TESTIFIED
LJ032-0222 MOREOVER SHANEYFELT TESTIFIED THAT IN HIS OPINION THE PHOTOGRAPHS WERE NOT COMPOSITES OF TWO DIFFERENT PHOTOGRAPHS
LJ032-0223 AND THAT OSWALD'S FACE HAD NOT BEEN SUPERIMPOSED ON ANOTHER BODY
LJ032-0224 ONE OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN BY MARINA OSWALD WAS WIDELY PUBLISHED IN NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES
LJ032-0225 AND IN MANY INSTANCES THE DETAILS OF THESE PICTURES DIFFERED FROM THE ORIGINAL AND EVEN FROM EACH OTHER PARTICULARLY AS TO THE CONFIGURATION OF THE RIFLE
LJ032-0226 THE COMMISSION SOUGHT TO DETERMINE WHETHER THESE PHOTOGRAPHS WERE TOUCHED PRIOR TO PUBLICATION
LJ032-0227 SHANEYFELT TESTIFIED THAT THE PUBLISHED PHOTOGRAPHS APPEARED TO BE BASED ON A COPY OF THE ORIGINAL WHICH THE PUBLICATIONS HAD EACH RETOUCHED DIFFERENTLY
LJ032-0228 SEVERAL OF THE PUBLICATIONS FURNISHED THE COMMISSION WITH THE PRINTS THEY HAD USED OR DESCRIBED BY CORRESPONDENCE THE RETOUCHING THEY HAD DONE
LJ032-0229 THIS INFORMATION ENABLED THE COMMISSION TO CONCLUDE
LJ032-0230 THAT THE PUBLISHED PICTURES WERE THE SAME AS THE ORIGINAL EXCEPT FOR RETOUCHING DONE BY THESE PUBLICATIONS APPARENTLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF CLARIFYING THE LINES OF THE RIFLE
LJ032-0231 AND OTHER DETAILS IN THE PICTURE
LJ032-0232 THE DATES SURROUNDING THE TAKING OF THIS PICTURE AND THE PURCHASE OF THE RIFLE
LJ032-0233 REINFORCE THE BELIEF THAT THE RIFLE IN THE PHOTOGRAPH IS THE RIFLE WHICH OSWALD BOUGHT FROM KLEIN'S
LJ032-0234 THE RIFLE WAS SHIPPED FROM KLEIN'S IN CHICAGO ON MARCH 20 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE AT A TIME WHEN THE OSWALDS WERE LIVING ON NEELY STREET
LJ032-0235 FROM AN EXAMINATION OF ONE OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS THE COMMISSION DETERMINED THE DATES OF THE ISSUES OF THE MILITANT AND THE WORKER WHICH OSWALD WAS HOLDING IN HIS HAND
LJ032-0236 BY CHECKING THE ACTUAL MAILING DATES OF THESE ISSUES AND THE TIME IT USUALLY TAKES TO EFFECT DELIVERY TO DALLAS
LJ032-0237 IT WAS ESTABLISHED THAT THE PHOTOGRAPHS MUST HAVE BEEN TAKEN SOMETIME AFTER MARCH 27
LJ032-0238 MARINA OSWALD TESTIFIED THAT THE PHOTOGRAPHS WERE TAKEN ON A SUNDAY ABOUT 2 WEEKS BEFORE THE ATTEMPTED SHOOTING OF MAJ. GEN. EDWIN A. WALKER
LJ032-0239 ON APRIL 10 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ032-0240 BY SUNDAY MARCH 31 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ032-0241 10 DAYS PRIOR TO THE WALKER ATTEMPT OSWALD HAD UNDOUBTEDLY RECEIVED THE RIFLE SHIPPED FROM CHICAGO ON MARCH 20
LJ032-0242 THE REVOLVER SHIPPED FROM LOS ANGELES ON THE SAME DATE AND THE TWO NEWSPAPERS WHICH HE WAS HOLDING IN THE PICTURE
LJ032-0243 RIFLE AMONG OSWALD'S POSSESSIONS
LJ032-0244 MARINA OSWALD TESTIFIED THAT THE RIFLE FOUND ON THE SIXTH FLOOR OF THE DEPOSITORY BUILDING WAS THE FATEFUL RIFLE OF LEE OSWALD
LJ032-0245 MOREOVER IT WAS THE ONLY RIFLE OWNED BY HER HUSBAND FOLLOWING HIS RETURN FROM THE SOVIET UNION IN JUNE NINETEEN SIXTY TWO
LJ032-0246 IT HAD BEEN PURCHASED IN MARCH NINETEEN SIXTY THREE AND TAKEN TO NEW ORLEANS WHERE MARINA OSWALD SAW IT IN THEIR RENTED APARTMENT
LJ032-0247 DURING THE SUMMER OF NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ032-0248 IT APPEARS FROM HIS WIFE'S TESTIMONY
LJ032-0249 THAT OSWALD MAY HAVE SAT ON THE SCREENEDIN PORCH AT NIGHT PRACTICING WITH THE RIFLE BY LOOKING THROUGH THE TELESCOPIC SIGHT AND OPERATING THE BOLT
LJ032-0250 IN SEPTEMBER NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ032-0251 OSWALD LOADED THEIR POSSESSIONS INTO A STATION WAGON OWNED BY RUTH PAINE WHO HAD INVITED MARINA OSWALD AND THE BABY TO LIVE AT HER HOME IN IRVING TEXAS
LJ032-0252 MARINA OSWALD HAS STATED THAT THE RIFLE WAS AMONG THESE POSSESSIONS ALTHOUGH RUTH PAINE TESTIFIED THAT SHE WAS NOT AWARE OF IT
LJ032-0253 FROM SEPTEMBER 24 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE WHEN MARINA OSWALD ARRIVED IN IRVING FROM NEW ORLEANS UNTIL THE MORNING OF THE ASSASSINATION
LJ032-0254 THE RIFLE WAS ACCORDING TO THE EVIDENCE STORED IN A GREEN AND BROWN BLANKET IN THE PAINES' GARAGE AMONG THE OSWALDS' OTHER POSSESSIONS
LJ032-0255 ABOUT 1 WEEK AFTER THE RETURN FROM NEW ORLEANS
LJ032-0256 MARINA OSWALD WAS LOOKING IN THE GARAGE FOR PARTS TO THE BABY'S CRIB AND THOUGHT THAT THE PARTS MIGHT BE IN THE BLANKET
LJ032-0257 WHEN SHE STARTED TO OPEN THE BLANKET SHE SAW THE STOCK OF THE RIFLE
LJ032-0258 RUTH AND MICHAEL PAINE BOTH NOTICED THE ROLLEDUP BLANKET IN THE GARAGE DURING THE TIME THAT MARINA OSWALD WAS LIVING IN THEIR HOME
LJ032-0259 ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS MICHAEL PAINE MOVED THE BLANKET IN THE GARAGE
LJ032-0260 HE THOUGHT IT CONTAINED TENT POLES OR POSSIBLY OTHER CAMPING EQUIPMENT SUCH AS A FOLDING SHOVEL
LJ032-0261 WHEN HE APPEARED BEFORE THE COMMISSION MICHAEL PAINE LIFTED THE BLANKET
LJ032-0262 WITH THE RIFLE WRAPPED INSIDE AND TESTIFIED THAT IT APPEARED TO BE THE SAME APPROXIMATE WEIGHT AND SHAPE AS THE PACKAGE IN HIS GARAGE
LJ032-0263 ABOUT 3 HOURS AFTER THE ASSASSINATION A DETECTIVE AND DEPUTY SHERIFF SAW THE BLANKETROLL
LJ032-0264 TIED WITH A STRING LYING ON THE FLOOR OF THE PAINES' GARAGE
LJ032-0265 EACH MAN TESTIFIED THAT HE THOUGHT HE COULD DETECT THE OUTLINE OF A RIFLE IN THE BLANKET EVEN THOUGH THE BLANKET WAS EMPTY
LJ032-0266 PAUL M. STOMBAUGH OF THE FBI LABORATORY
LJ032-0267 EXAMINED THE BLANKET AND DISCOVERED A BULGE APPROXIMATELY 10 INCHES LONG MIDWAY IN THE BLANKET
LJ032-0268 THIS BULGE WAS APPARENTLY CAUSED BY A HARD PROTRUDING OBJECT WHICH HAD STRETCHED THE BLANKET'S FIBERS
LJ032-0269 IT COULD HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE TELESCOPIC SIGHT OF THE RIFLE WHICH WAS APPROXIMATELY 11 INCHES LONG
LJ032-0270 HAVING REVIEWED THE EVIDENCE THAT 1 LEE HARVEY OSWALD PURCHASED THE RIFLE USED IN THE ASSASSINATION
LJ032-0271 2 OSWALD'S PALMPRINT WAS ON THE RIFLE IN A POSITION WHICH SHOWS THAT HE HAD HANDLED IT WHILE IT WAS DISASSEMBLED
LJ032-0272 3 FIBERS FOUND ON THE RIFLE MOST PROBABLY CAME FROM THE SHIRT OSWALD WAS WEARING ON THE DAY OF THE ASSASSINATION
LJ032-0273 4 A PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN IN THE YARD OF OSWALD'S APARTMENT SHOWED HIM HOLDING THIS RIFLE AND 5
LJ032-0274 THE RIFLE WAS KEPT AMONG OSWALD'S POSSESSIONS FROM THE TIME OF ITS PURCHASE UNTIL THE DAY OF THE ASSASSINATION
LJ032-0275 THE COMMISSION CONCLUDED THAT THE RIFLE USED TO ASSASSINATE PRESIDENT KENNEDY AND WOUND GOVERNOR CONNALLY WAS OWNED AND POSSESSED BY LEE HARVEY OSWALD

LJ033-0005 WAS BROUGHT INTO THE DEPOSITORY BUILDING WHERE IT WAS FOUND ON THE SIXTH FLOOR SHORTLY AFTER THE ASSASSINATION
LJ033-0006 IN THIS CONNECTION THE COMMISSION CONSIDERED 1
LJ033-0007 THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING OSWALD'S RETURN TO IRVING TEXAS ON THURSDAY NOVEMBER 21 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ033-0008 2 THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE RIFLE FROM ITS NORMAL PLACE OF STORAGE 3

LJ033-0010 THE PRESENCE OF A LONG HANDMADE BROWN PAPER BAG NEAR THE POINT FROM WHICH THE SHOTS WERE FIRED AND 5 THE PALMPRINT
LJ033-0011 FIBER AND PAPER ANALYSES LINKING OSWALD AND THE ASSASSINATION WEAPON TO THIS BAG
LJ033-0012 THE CURTAIN ROD STORY
LJ033-0013 DURING OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER OF NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ033-0014 LEE HARVEY OSWALD LIVED IN A ROOMINGHOUSE IN DALLAS WHILE HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN LIVED IN IRVING AT THE HOME OF RUTH PAINE
LJ033-0015 APPROXIMATELY 15 MILES FROM OSWALD'S PLACE OF WORK AT THE TEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY

LJ033-0018 OSWALD GENERALLY WOULD GO TO IRVING ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND RETURN TO DALLAS MONDAY MORNING
LJ033-0019 ACCORDING TO THE TESTIMONY OF FRAZIER MARINA OSWALD AND RUTH PAINE IT APPEARS THAT OSWALD NEVER RETURNED TO IRVING IN MIDWEEK
LJ033-0020 PRIOR TO NOVEMBER 21 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE EXCEPT ON MONDAY OCTOBER 21 WHEN HE VISITED HIS WIFE IN THE HOSPITAL
LJ033-0021 AFTER THE BIRTH OF THEIR SECOND CHILD
LJ033-0022 DURING THE MORNING OF NOVEMBER 21 OSWALD ASKED FRAZIER WHETHER HE COULD RIDE HOME WITH HIM THAT AFTERNOON
LJ033-0023 FRAZIER SURPRISED ASKED HIM WHY HE WAS GOING TO IRVING ON THURSDAY NIGHT RATHER THAN FRIDAY
LJ033-0024 OSWALD REPLIED QUOTE I'M GOING HOME TO GET SOME CURTAIN RODS TO PUT IN AN APARTMENT END QUOTE
LJ033-0025 THE TWO MEN LEFT WORK AT 440 P.M. AND DROVE TO IRVING
LJ033-0026 THERE WAS LITTLE CONVERSATION BETWEEN THEM ON THE WAY HOME
LJ033-0027 MRS. LINNIE MAE RANDLE FRAZIER'S SISTER COMMENTED TO HER BROTHER ABOUT OSWALD'S UNUSUAL MIDWEEK RETURN TO IRVING
LJ033-0028 FRAZIER TOLD HER THAT OSWALD HAD COME HOME TO GET CURTAIN RODS
LJ033-0029 IT WOULD APPEAR HOWEVER THAT OBTAINING CURTAIN RODS WAS NOT THE PURPOSE OF OSWALD'S TRIP TO IRVING ON NOVEMBER 21
LJ033-0030 MRS. A. C. JOHNSON HIS LANDLADY TESTIFIED THAT OSWALD'S ROOM AT 1026 NORTH BECKLEY AVENUE
LJ033-0031 HAD CURTAINS AND CURTAIN RODS AND THAT OSWALD HAD NEVER DISCUSSED THE SUBJECT WITH HER
LJ033-0032 IN THE PAINES' GARAGE ALONG WITH MANY OTHER OBJECTS OF A HOUSEHOLD CHARACTER
LJ033-0033 THERE WERE TWO FLAT LIGHTWEIGHT CURTAIN RODS BELONGING TO RUTH PAINE BUT THEY WERE STILL THERE ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON AFTER OSWALD'S ARREST
LJ033-0034 OSWALD NEVER ASKED MRS. PAINE ABOUT THE USE OF CURTAIN RODS
LJ033-0035 AND MARINA OSWALD TESTIFIED THAT OSWALD DID NOT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT CURTAIN RODS ON THE DAY BEFORE THE ASSASSINATION
LJ033-0036 NO CURTAIN RODS WERE KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED IN THE DEPOSITORY BUILDING AFTER THE ASSASSINATION
LJ033-0037 IN DECIDING WHETHER OSWALD CARRIED A RIFLE TO WORK IN A LONG PAPER BAG ON NOVEMBER 22
LJ033-0038 THE COMMISSION GAVE WEIGHT TO THE FACT THAT OSWALD GAVE A FALSE REASON FOR RETURNING HOME ON NOVEMBER 21
LJ033-0039 AND ONE WHICH PROVIDED AN EXCUSE FOR THE CARRYING OF A BULKY PACKAGE THE FOLLOWING MORNING
LJ033-0040 BEFORE DINNER ON NOVEMBER 21 OSWALD PLAYED ON THE LAWN OF THE PAINES' HOME WITH HIS DAUGHTER JUNE
LJ033-0041 AFTER DINNER RUTH PAINE AND MARINA OSWALD WERE BUSY CLEANING HOUSE AND PREPARING THEIR CHILDREN FOR BED
LJ033-0042 BETWEEN THE HOURS OF 8 AND 9 P.M. THEY WERE OCCUPIED WITH THE CHILDREN IN THE BEDROOMS LOCATED AT THE EXTREME EAST END OF THE HOUSE
LJ033-0043 ON THE WEST END OF THE HOUSE IS THE ATTACHED GARAGE WHICH CAN BE REACHED FROM THE KITCHEN OR FROM THE OUTSIDE
LJ033-0044 IN THE GARAGE WERE THE PERSONAL BELONGINGS OF THE OSWALD FAMILY INCLUDING AS THE EVIDENCE HAS SHOWN THE RIFLE WRAPPED IN THE OLD BROWN AND GREEN BLANKET
LJ033-0045 AT APPROXIMATELY 9 P.M. AFTER THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN PUT TO BED MRS. PAINE ACCORDING TO HER TESTIMONY BEFORE THE COMMISSION QUOTE
LJ033-0046 WENT OUT TO THE GARAGE TO PAINT SOME CHILDREN'S BLOCKS AND WORKED IN THE GARAGE FOR HALF AN HOUR OR SO
LJ033-0047 I NOTICED WHEN I WENT OUT THAT THE LIGHT WAS ON END QUOTE
LJ033-0048 MRS. PAINE WAS CERTAIN THAT SHE HAD NOT LEFT THE LIGHT ON IN THE GARAGE AFTER DINNER
LJ033-0049 ACCORDING TO MRS. PAINE OSWALD HAD GONE TO BED BY NINE P.M.
LJ033-0050 MARINA OSWALD TESTIFIED THAT IT WAS BETWEEN NINE AND TEN P.M.
LJ033-0051 NEITHER MARINA OSWALD NOR RUTH PAINE SAW OSWALD IN THE GARAGE
LJ033-0052 THE PERIOD BETWEEN EIGHT AND NINE P.M. HOWEVER PROVIDED AMPLE OPPORTUNITY FOR OSWALD TO PREPARE THE RIFLE FOR HIS DEPARTURE THE NEXT MORNING
LJ033-0053 ONLY IF DISASSEMBLED COULD THE RIFLE FIT INTO THE PAPER BAG FOUND NEAR THE WINDOW FROM WHICH THE SHOTS WERE FIRED
LJ033-0054 A FIREARMS EXPERT WITH THE FBI ASSEMBLED THE RIFLE IN 6 MINUTES USING A TEN CENT COIN AS A TOOL
LJ033-0055 AND HE COULD DISASSEMBLE IT MORE RAPIDLY
LJ033-0056 WHILE THE RIFLE MAY HAVE ALREADY BEEN DISASSEMBLED WHEN OSWALD ARRIVED HOME ON THURSDAY HE HAD AMPLE TIME THAT EVENING TO DISASSEMBLE THE RIFLE
LJ033-0057 AND INSERT IT INTO THE PAPER BAG
LJ033-0058 ON THE DAY OF THE ASSASSINATION MARINA OSWALD WAS WATCHING TELEVISION WHEN SHE LEARNED OF THE SHOOTING
LJ033-0059 A SHORT TIME LATER MRS. PAINE TOLD HER THAT SOMEONE HAD SHOT THE PRESIDENT QUOTE FROM THE BUILDING IN WHICH LEE IS WORKING END QUOTE
LJ033-0060 MARINA OSWALD TESTIFIED THAT AT THAT TIME QUOTE MY HEART DROPPED
LJ033-0061 I THEN WENT TO THE GARAGE TO SEE WHETHER THE RIFLE WAS THERE AND I SAW THAT THE BLANKET WAS STILL THERE AND I SAID THANK GOD END QUOTE
LJ033-0062 SHE DID NOT UNROLL THE BLANKET. SHE SAW THAT IT WAS IN ITS USUAL POSITION AND IT APPEARED TO HER TO HAVE SOMETHING INSIDE
LJ033-0063 SOON AFTERWARD AT ABOUT 3 P.M. POLICE OFFICERS ARRIVED AND SEARCHED THE HOUSE
LJ033-0064 MRS. PAINE POINTED OUT THAT MOST OF THE OSWALDS' POSSESSIONS WERE IN THE GARAGE
LJ033-0065 WITH RUTH PAINE ACTING AS AN INTERPRETER DETECTIVE ROSE ASKED MARINA WHETHER HER HUSBAND HAD A RIFLE
LJ033-0066 MRS. PAINE WHO HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE RIFLE FIRST SAID NO BUT WHEN THE QUESTION WAS TRANSLATED MARINA OSWALD REPLIED YES
LJ033-0067 SHE POINTED TO THE BLANKET WHICH WAS ON THE FLOOR VERY CLOSE TO WHERE RUTH PAINE WAS STANDING
LJ033-0068 MRS. PAINE TESTIFIED QUOTE
LJ033-0069 AS SHE [MARINA] TOLD ME ABOUT IT I STEPPED ONTO THE BLANKET ROLL
LJ033-0070 AND SHE INDICATED TO ME THAT SHE HAD PEERED INTO THIS ROLL AND SAW A PORTION OF WHAT SHE TOOK TO BE A GUN SHE KNEW HER HUSBAND TO HAVE A RIFLE
LJ033-0071 AND I THEN TRANSLATED THIS TO THE OFFICERS THAT SHE KNEW THAT HER HUSBAND HAD A GUN THAT HE HAD STORED IN HERE
LJ033-0072 I THEN STEPPED OFF OF IT AND THE OFFICER PICKED IT UP IN THE MIDDLE AND IT BENT SO
LJ033-0073 MRS. PAINE HAD THE ACTUAL BLANKET BEFORE HER AS SHE TESTIFIED AND SHE INDICATED THAT THE BLANKET HUNG LIMP IN THE OFFICER'S HAND
LJ033-0074 MARINA OSWALD TESTIFIED THAT THIS WAS HER FIRST KNOWLEDGE THAT THE RIFLE WAS NOT IN ITS ACCUSTOMED PLACE
LJ033-0075 THE LONG AND BULKY PACKAGE
LJ033-0076 ON THE MORNING OF NOVEMBER 22 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ033-0077 LEE HARVEY OSWALD LEFT THE PAINE HOUSE IN IRVING AT APPROXIMATELY SEVEN FIFTEEN A.M. WHILE MARINA OSWALD WAS STILL IN BED
LJ033-0078 NEITHER SHE NOR MRS. PAINE SAW HIM LEAVE THE HOUSE. ABOUT HALFABLOCK AWAY FROM THE PAINE HOUSE WAS THE RESIDENCE OF MRS. LINNIE MAE RANDLE
LJ033-0079 SISTER OF THE MAN WITH WHOM OSWALD DROVE TO WORK  BUELL WESLEY FRAZIER
LJ033-0080 MRS. RANDLE STATED THAT ON THE MORNING OF NOVEMBER 22 WHILE HER BROTHER WAS EATING BREAKFAST
LJ033-0081 SHE LOOKED OUT THE BREAKFASTROOM WINDOW AND SAW OSWALD CROSS THE STREET AND WALK TOWARD THE DRIVEWAY WHERE HER BROTHER PARKED HIS CAR NEAR THE CARPORT
LJ033-0082 HE CARRIED A QUOTE HEAVY BROWN BAG END QUOTE
LJ033-0083 OSWALD GRIPPED THE BAG IN HIS RIGHT HAND NEAR THE TOP QUOTE IT TAPERED LIKE THIS AS HE HUGGED IT IN HIS HAND
LJ033-0084 IT WAS MORE BULKY TOWARD THE BOTTOM END QUOTE THAN TOWARD THE TOP
LJ033-0085 SHE THEN OPENED THE KITCHEN DOOR AND SAW OSWALD OPEN THE RIGHT REAR DOOR OF HER BROTHER'S CAR AND PLACE THE PACKAGE IN THE BACK OF THE CAR
LJ033-0086 MRS. RANDLE ESTIMATED THAT THE PACKAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 28 INCHES LONG AND ABOUT 8 INCHES WIDE
LJ033-0087 SHE THOUGHT THAT ITS COLOR WAS SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE BAG FOUND ON THE SIXTH FLOOR OF THE SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY AFTER THE ASSASSINATION
LJ033-0088 FRAZIER MET OSWALD AT THE KITCHEN DOOR AND TOGETHER THEY WALKED TO THE CAR
LJ033-0089 AFTER ENTERING THE CAR FRAZIER GLANCED OVER HIS SHOULDER AND NOTICED A BROWN PAPER PACKAGE ON THE BACK SEAT
LJ033-0090 HE ASKED QUOTE WHAT'S THE PACKAGE LEE END QUOTE OSWALD REPLIED QUOTE CURTAIN RODS END QUOTE
LJ033-0091 FRAZIER TOLD THE COMMISSION QUOTE
LJ033-0092 THE MAIN REASON HE WAS GOING OVER THERE THAT THURSDAY AFTERNOON WHEN HE WAS TO BRING BACK SOME CURTAIN RODS SO I DIDN'T THINK ANY MORE ABOUT IT WHEN HE TOLD ME THAT END QUOTE
LJ033-0093 FRAZIER ESTIMATED THAT THE BAG WAS 2 FEET LONG QUOTE GIVE AND TAKE A FEW INCHES END QUOTE AND ABOUT FIVE OR SIX INCHES WIDE
LJ033-0094 AS THEY SAT IN THE CAR FRAZIER ASKED OSWALD WHERE HIS LUNCH WAS AND OSWALD REPLIED THAT HE WAS GOING TO BUY HIS LUNCH THAT DAY
LJ033-0095 FRAZIER TESTIFIED THAT OSWALD CARRIED NO LUNCH BAG THAT DAY
LJ033-0096 QUOTE WHEN HE RODE WITH ME I SAY HE ALWAYS BROUGHT LUNCH EXCEPT THAT ONE DAY ON NOVEMBER 22 HE DIDN'T BRING HIS LUNCH THAT DAY END QUOTE
LJ033-0097 FRAZIER PARKED THE CAR IN THE COMPANY PARKING LOT ABOUT TWO BLOCKS NORTH OF THE DEPOSITORY BUILDING
LJ033-0098 OSWALD LEFT THE CAR FIRST PICKED UP THE BROWN PAPER BAG AND PROCEEDED TOWARD THE BUILDING AHEAD OF FRAZIER
LJ033-0099 FRAZIER WALKED BEHIND AND AS THEY CROSSED THE RAILROAD TRACKS HE WATCHED THE SWITCHING OF THE CARS
LJ033-0100 FRAZIER RECALLED THAT ONE END OF THE PACKAGE WAS UNDER OSWALD'S ARMPIT AND THE LOWER PART WAS HELD WITH HIS RIGHT HAND
LJ033-0101 SO THAT IT WAS CARRIED STRAIGHT AND PARALLEL TO HIS BODY
LJ033-0102 WHEN OSWALD ENTERED THE REAR DOOR OF THE DEPOSITORY BUILDING HE WAS ABOUT 50 FEET AHEAD OF FRAZIER
LJ033-0103 IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT OSWALD HAD NOT WALKED WITH FRAZIER FROM THE PARKING LOT TO THE BUILDING ENTRANCE
LJ033-0104 WHEN FRAZIER ENTERED THE BUILDING HE DID NOT SEE OSWALD
LJ033-0105 ONE EMPLOYEE JACK DOUGHERTY
LJ033-0106 BELIEVED THAT HE SAW OSWALD COMING TO WORK BUT HE DOES NOT REMEMBER THAT OSWALD HAD ANYTHING IN HIS HANDS AS HE ENTERED THE DOOR
LJ033-0107 NO OTHER EMPLOYEE HAS BEEN FOUND WHO SAW OSWALD ENTER THAT MORNING
LJ033-0108 IN DECIDING WHETHER OSWALD CARRIED THE ASSASSINATION WEAPON IN THE BAG WHICH FRAZIER AND MRS. RANDLE SAW
LJ033-0109 THE COMMISSION HAS CAREFULLY CONSIDERED THE TESTIMONY OF THESE TWO WITNESSES WITH REGARD TO THE LENGTH OF THE BAG
LJ033-0110 FRAZIER AND MRS. RANDLE TESTIFIED
LJ033-0111 THAT THE BAG WHICH OSWALD WAS CARRYING WAS APPROXIMATELY TWENTY SEVEN OR TWENTY EIGHT INCHES LONG WHEREAS THE WOODEN STOCK OF THE RIFLE WHICH IS ITS LARGEST COMPONENT
LJ033-0112 MEASURED 34.8 INCHES
LJ033-0113 THE BAG FOUND ON THE SIXTH FLOOR WAS EIGHTY EIGHT INCHES LONG
LJ033-0114 WHEN FRAZIER APPEARED BEFORE THE COMMISSION AND WAS ASKED TO DEMONSTRATE HOW OSWALD CARRIED THE PACKAGE HE SAID QUOTE LIKE I SAID
LJ033-0115 I REMEMBER THAT I DIDN'T LOOK AT THE PACKAGE VERY MUCH BUT WHEN I DID LOOK AT IT HE DID HAVE HIS HANDS ON THE PACKAGE LIKE THAT END QUOTE AND AT THIS POINT
LJ033-0116 FRAZIER PLACED THE UPPER PART OF THE PACKAGE UNDER HIS ARMPIT AND ATTEMPTED TO CUP HIS RIGHT HAND BENEATH THE BOTTOM OF THE BAG
LJ033-0117 THE DISASSEMBLED RIFLE WAS TOO LONG TO BE CARRIED IN THIS MANNER
LJ033-0118 SIMILARLY WHEN THE BUTT OF THE RIFLE WAS PLACED IN FRAZIER'S HAND IT EXTENDED ABOVE HIS SHOULDER TO EAR LEVEL
LJ033-0119 MOREOVER IN AN INTERVIEW ON DECEMBER ONE NINETEEN SIXTY THREE WITH AGENTS OF THE FBI FRAZIER HAD MARKED THE POINT ON THE BACK SEAT OF HIS CAR
LJ033-0120 WHICH HE BELIEVED WAS WHERE THE BAG REACHED WHEN IT WAS LAID ON THE SEAT WITH ONE EDGE AGAINST THE DOOR
LJ033-0121 THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE POINT ON THE SEAT AND THE DOOR WAS TWENTY SEVEN INCHES
LJ033-0122 MRS. RANDLE SAID WHEN SHOWN THE PAPER BAG
LJ033-0123 THAT THE BAG SHE SAW OSWALD CARRYING QUOTE WASN'T THAT LONG I MEAN IT WAS FOLDED DOWN AT THE TOP AS I TOLD YOU IT DEFINITELY WASN'T THAT LONG END QUOTE
LJ033-0124 AND SHE FOLDED THE BAG TO LENGTH OF ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT AND A HALF INCHES
LJ033-0125 FRAZIER DOUBTED WHETHER THE BAG THAT OSWALD CARRIED WAS AS WIDE AS THE BAG FOUND ON THE SIXTH FLOOR ALTHOUGH MRS. RANDLE TESTIFIED
LJ033-0126 THAT THE WIDTH WAS APPROXIMATELY THE SAME
LJ033-0127 THE COMMISSION HAS WEIGHED THE VISUAL RECOLLECTION OF FRAZIER AND MRS. RANDLE AGAINST THE EVIDENCE HERE PRESENTED
LJ033-0128 THAT THE BAG OSWALD CARRIED CONTAINED THE ASSASSINATION WEAPON AND HAS CONCLUDED THAT FRAZIER AND RANDLE ARE MISTAKEN AS TO THE LENGTH OF THE BAG
LJ033-0129 MRS. RANDLE SAW THE BAG FLEETINGLY
LJ033-0130 AND HER FIRST REMEMBRANCE IS THAT IT WAS HELD IN OSWALD'S RIGHT HAND QUOTE AND IT ALMOST TOUCHED THE GROUND AS HE CARRIED IT END QUOTE
LJ033-0131 FRAZIER'S VIEW OF THE BAG WAS FROM THE REAR. HE CONTINUALLY ADVISED THAT HE WAS NOT PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION. FOR EXAMPLE HE SAID QUOTE
LJ033-0132 I DIDN'T PAY TOO MUCH ATTENTION THE WAY HE WAS WALKING BECAUSE I WAS WALKING ALONG THERE LOOKING AT THE RAILROAD CARS AND WATCHING THE MEN ON THE DIESEL SWITCH THEM CARS
LJ033-0133 AND I DIDN'T PAY TOO MUCH ATTENTION ON HOW HE CARRIED THE PACKAGE AT ALL END QUOTE
LJ033-0134 FRAZIER COULD EASILY HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN WHEN HE STATED THAT OSWALD HELD THE BOTTOM OF THE BAG CUPPED IN HIS HAND WITH THE UPPER END TUCKED INTO HIS ARMPIT
LJ033-0135 LOCATION OF BAG
LJ033-0136 A HANDMADE BAG OF WRAPPING PAPER AND TAPE WAS FOUND IN THE SOUTHEAST CORNER OF THE SIXTH FLOOR ALONGSIDE THE WINDOW FROM WHICH THE SHOTS WERE FIRED
LJ033-0137 IT WAS NOT A STANDARD TYPE BAG WHICH COULD BE OBTAINED IN A STORE AND IT WAS PRESUMABLY MADE FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
LJ033-0138 IT WAS THE APPROPRIATE SIZE TO CONTAIN IN DISASSEMBLED FORM
LJ033-0139 OSWALD'S MANNLICHERCARCANO RIFLE SERIAL NO. C2766 WHICH WAS ALSO FOUND ON THE SIXTH FLOOR
LJ033-0140 THREE CARTONS HAD BEEN PLACED AT THE WINDOW APPARENTLY TO ACT AS A GUN REST AND A FOURTH CARTON WAS PLACED BEHIND THOSE AT THE WINDOW
LJ033-0141 A PERSON SEATED ON THE FOURTH CARTON COULD ASSEMBLE THE RIFLE WITHOUT BEING SEEN FROM THE REST OF THE SIXTH FLOOR
LJ033-0142 BECAUSE THE CARTONS STACKED AROUND THE SOUTHEAST CORNER WOULD SHIELD HIM
LJ033-0143 THE PRESENCE OF THE BAG IN THIS CORNER IS COGENT EVIDENCE THAT IT WAS USED AS THE CONTAINER FOR THE RIFLE
LJ033-0144 AT THE TIME THE BAG WAS FOUND LIEUTENANT DAY OF THE DALLAS POLICE WROTE ON IT QUOTE FOUND NEXT TO THE SIXTH FLOOR WINDOW GUN FIRED FROM
LJ033-0145 MAY HAVE BEEN USED TO CARRY GUN. LT. J. C. DAY END QUOTE
LJ033-0146 SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE LINKING RIFLE AND OSWALD TO PAPER BAG
LJ033-0147 OSWALD'S FINGERPRINT AND PALMPRINT FOUND ON BAG
LJ033-0148 USING A STANDARD CHEMICAL METHOD INVOLVING SILVER NITRATES
LJ033-0149 THE FBI LABORATORY DEVELOPED A LATENT PALMPRINT AND LATENT FINGERPRINT ON THE BAG
LJ033-0150 SEBASTIAN F. LATONA SUPERVISOR OF THE FBI'S LATENT FINGERPRINT SECTION
LJ033-0151 IDENTIFIED THESE PRINTS AS THE LEFT INDEX FINGERPRINT AND RIGHT PALMPRINT OF LEE HARVEY OSWALD
LJ033-0152 THE PORTION OF THE PALM WHICH WAS IDENTIFIED WAS THE HEEL OF THE RIGHT PALM I.E. THE AREA NEAR THE WRIST ON THE LITTLE FINGER SIDE
LJ033-0153 THESE PRINTS WERE EXAMINED INDEPENDENTLY BY RONALD G. WITTMUS OF THE FBI
LJ033-0154 AND BY ARTHUR MANDELLA A FINGERPRINT EXPERT WITH THE NEW YORK CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT
LJ033-0155 BOTH CONCLUDED THAT THE PRINTS WERE THE RIGHT PALM AND LEFT INDEX FINGER OF LEE OSWALD NO OTHER IDENTIFIABLE PRINTS WERE FOUND ON THE BAG
LJ033-0156 OSWALD'S PALMPRINT ON THE BOTTOM OF THE PAPER BAG INDICATED OF COURSE THAT HE HAD HANDLED THE BAG
LJ033-0157 FURTHERMORE IT WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE BAG HAVING CONTAINED A HEAVY OR BULKY OBJECT WHEN HE HANDLED IT SINCE A LIGHT OBJECT IS USUALLY HELD BY THE FINGERS
LJ033-0158 THE PALMPRINT WAS FOUND ON THE CLOSED END OF THE BAG
LJ033-0159 IT WAS FROM OSWALD'S RIGHT HAND IN WHICH HE CARRIED THE LONG PACKAGE AS HE WALKED FROM FRAZIER'S CAR TO THE BUILDING
LJ033-0160 MATERIALS USED TO MAKE BAG
LJ033-0161 ON THE DAY OF THE ASSASSINATION THE DALLAS POLICE OBTAINED A SAMPLE OF WRAPPING PAPER AND TAPE
LJ033-0162 FROM THE SHIPPING ROOM OF THE DEPOSITORY AND FORWARDED IT TO THE FBI LABORATORY IN WASHINGTON
LJ033-0163 JAMES C. CADIGAN A QUESTIONEDDOCUMENTS EXPERT WITH THE BUREAU COMPARED THE SAMPLES WITH THE PAPER AND TAPE IN THE ACTUAL BAG
LJ033-0164 HE TESTIFIED QUOTE
LJ033-0165 IN ALL OF THE OBSERVATIONS AND PHYSICAL TESTS THAT I MADE I FOUND THE BAG AND THE PAPER SAMPLE WERE THE SAME END QUOTE
LJ033-0166 AMONG OTHER TESTS THE PAPER AND TAPE WERE SUBMITTED TO FIBER ANALYSIS AND SPECTROGRAPHIC EXAMINATION
LJ033-0167 IN ADDITION THE TAPE WAS COMPARED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE SAMPLE TAPE AND THE TAPE ON THE BAG HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM THE TAPE DISPENSING MACHINE AT THE DEPOSITORY
LJ033-0168 WHEN ASKED TO EXPLAIN THE SIMILARITY OF CHARACTERISTICS CADIGAN STATED QUOTE WELL BRIEFLY
LJ033-0169 IT WOULD BE THE THICKNESS OF BOTH THE PAPER AND THE TAPE THE COLOR UNDER VARIOUS LIGHTING CONDITIONS OF BOTH THE PAPER AND THE TAPE
LJ033-0170 THE WIDTH OF THE TAPE THE KNURLED MARKINGS ON THE SURFACE OF THE FIBER THE TEXTURE OF THE FIBER THE LETTING PATTERN
LJ033-0171 I FOUND THAT THE PAPER SACK FOUND ON THE SIXTH FLOOR AND THE SAMPLE
LJ033-0172 HAD THE SAME OBSERVABLE CHARACTERISTICS BOTH UNDER THE MICROSCOPE AND ALL THE VISUAL TESTS THAT I COULD CONDUCT
LJ033-0173 THE PAPERS I ALSO FOUND WERE SIMILAR IN FIBER COMPOSITION THEREFORE IN ADDITION TO THE VISUAL CHARACTERISTICS
LJ033-0174 MICROSCOPIC AND UV ULTRA VIOLET CHARACTERISTICS END QUOTE
LJ033-0175 MR. CADIGAN CONCLUDED THAT THE PAPER AND TAPE FROM THE BAG WERE IDENTICAL IN ALL RESPECTS TO THE SAMPLE PAPER AND TAPE
LJ033-0176 TAKEN FROM THE TEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY SHIPPING ROOM ON NOVEMBER 22 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ033-0177 ON DECEMBER 1 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE A REPLICA BAG WAS MADE FROM MATERIALS FOUND ON THAT DATE IN THE SHIPPING ROOM
LJ033-0178 THIS WAS DONE AS AN INVESTIGATORY AID
LJ033-0179 SINCE THE ORIGINAL BAG HAD BEEN DISCOLORED DURING VARIOUS LABORATORY EXAMINATIONS AND COULD NOT BE USED FOR VALID IDENTIFICATION BY WITNESSES
LJ033-0180 CADIGAN FOUND THAT THE PAPER USED TO MAKE THIS REPLICA SACK HAD DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS FROM THE PAPER IN THE ORIGINAL BAG
LJ033-0181 THE SCIENCE OF PAPER ANALYSIS ENABLED HIM TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN DIFFERENT ROLLS OF PAPER EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE PRODUCED BY THE SAME MANUFACTURER
LJ033-0182 SINCE THE DEPOSITORY NORMALLY USED APPROXIMATELY ONE ROLL OF PAPER EVERY 3 WORKING DAYS
LJ033-0183 IT WAS NOT SURPRISING THAT THE REPLICA SACK MADE ON DECEMBER 1 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ033-0184 HAD DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS FROM BOTH THE ACTUAL BAG AND THE SAMPLE TAKEN ON NOVEMBER TWENTY TWO
LJ033-0185 ON THE OTHER HAND SINCE TWO ROLLS COULD BE MADE FROM THE SAME BATCH OF PAPER
LJ033-0186 ONE CANNOT ESTIMATE WHEN PRIOR TO NOVEMBER TWENTY TWO OSWALD MADE THE PAPER BAG
LJ033-0187 HOWEVER THE COMPLETE IDENTITY OF CHARACTERISTICS BETWEEN THE PAPER AND TAPE IN THE BAG FOUND ON THE SIXTH FLOOR
LJ033-0188 AND THE PAPER AND TAPE FOUND IN THE SHIPPING ROOM OF THE DEPOSITORY ON NOVEMBER 22
LJ033-0189 ENABLED THE COMMISSION TO CONCLUDE THAT THE BAG WAS MADE FROM THESE MATERIALS
LJ033-0190 THE DEPOSITORY SHIPPING DEPARTMENT WAS ON THE FIRST FLOOR TO WHICH OSWALD HAD ACCESS IN THE NORMAL PERFORMANCE OF HIS DUTIES FILLING ORDERS
LJ033-0191 FIBERS IN PAPER BAG MATCHED FIBERS IN BLANKET
LJ033-0192 WHEN PAUL M. STOMBAUGH OF THE FBI LABORATORY EXAMINED THE PAPER BAG
LJ033-0193 HE FOUND ON THE INSIDE A SINGLE BROWN DELUSTERED VISCOSE FIBER AND SEVERAL LIGHT GREEN COTTON FIBERS
LJ033-0194 THE BLANKET IN WHICH THE RIFLE WAS STORED WAS COMPOSED OF BROWN AND GREEN COTTON VISCOSE AND WOOLEN FIBERS
LJ033-0195 THE SINGLE BROWN VISCOSE FIBER FOUND IN THE BAG MATCHED SOME OF THE BROWN VISCOSE FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET IN ALL OBSERVABLE CHARACTERISTICS
LJ033-0196 THE GREEN COTTON FIBERS FOUND IN THE PAPER BAG MATCHED SOME OF THE GREEN COTTON FIBERS IN THE BLANKET
LJ033-0197 QUOTE IN ALL OBSERVABLE MICROSCOPIC CHARACTERISTICS END QUOTE
LJ033-0198 DESPITE THESE MATCHES HOWEVER STOMBAUGH WAS UNABLE TO RENDER ON OPINION THAT THE FIBERS WHICH HE FOUND IN THE BAG HAD PROBABLY COME FROM THE BLANKET
LJ033-0199 BECAUSE OTHER TYPES OF FIBERS PRESENT IN THE BLANKET WERE NOT FOUND IN THE BAG
LJ033-0200 HE CONCLUDED QUOTE
LJ033-0201 ALL I WOULD SAY HERE IS THAT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THESE FIBERS COULD HAVE COME FROM THIS BLANKET
LJ033-0202 BECAUSE THIS BLANKET IS COMPOSED OF BROWN AND GREEN WOOLEN FIBERS BROWN AND GREEN DELUSTERED VISCOSE FIBERS AND BROWN AND GREEN COTTON FIBERS
LJ033-0203 WE FOUND NO BROWN COTTON FIBERS NO GREEN VISCOSE FIBERS AND NO WOOLEN FIBERS
LJ033-0204 SO IF I FOUND ALL OF THESE THEN I WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SAY THESE FIBERS PROBABLY HAD COME FROM THIS BLANKET. BUT SINCE I FOUND SO FEW
LJ033-0205 THEN I WOULD SAY THE POSSIBILITY EXISTS THESE FIBERS COULD HAVE COME FROM THIS BLANKET END QUOTE
LJ033-0206 STOMBAUGH CONFIRMED THAT THE RIFLE COULD HAVE PICKED UP FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET AND TRANSFERRED THEM TO THE PAPER BAG
LJ033-0207 IN LIGHT OF THE OTHER EVIDENCE LINKING LEE HARVEY OSWALD THE BLANKET AND THE RIFLE TO THE PAPER BAG FOUND ON THE SIXTH FLOOR
LJ033-0208 THE COMMISSION CONSIDERED STOMBAUGH'S TESTIMONY OF PROBATIVE VALUE IN DECIDING WHETHER OSWALD CARRIED THE RIFLE INTO THE BUILDING IN THE PAPER BAG
LJ033-0209 THE PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE CONCLUSION THAT LEE HARVEY OSWALD 1
LJ033-0210 TOLD THE CURTAIN ROD STORY TO FRAZIER TO EXPLAIN BOTH THE RETURN TO IRVING ON A THURSDAY
LJ033-0211 AND THE OBVIOUS BULK OF THE PACKAGE WHICH HE INTENDED TO BRING TO WORK THE NEXT DAY
LJ033-0212 2 TOOK PAPER AND TAPE FROM THE WRAPPING BENCH OF THE DEPOSITORY AND FASHIONED A BAG LARGE ENOUGH TO CARRY THE DISASSEMBLED RIFLE
LJ033-0213 3 REMOVED THE RIFLE FROM THE BLANKET IN THE PAINES' GARAGE ON THURSDAY EVENING
LJ033-0214 4 CARRIED THE RIFLE INTO THE DEPOSITORY BUILDING CONCEALED IN THE BAG
LJ034-0001 REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION ON THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY
LJ034-0002 THE WARREN COMMISSION REPORT. BY THE PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION ON THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY. CHAPTER 4. THE ASSASSIN PART 3
LJ034-0003 OSWALD AT WINDOW
LJ034-0004 LEE HARVEY OSWALD WAS HIRED ON OCTOBER 15 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE BY THE TEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY AS AN ORDER FILLER
LJ034-0005 HE WORKED PRINCIPALLY ON THE FIRST AND SIXTH FLOORS OF THE BUILDING GATHERING BOOKS LISTED ON ORDERS AND DELIVERING THEM TO THE SHIPPING ROOM ON THE FIRST FLOOR
LJ034-0006 HE HAD READY ACCESS TO THE SIXTH FLOOR FROM THE SOUTHEAST CORNER WINDOW OF WHICH THE SHOTS WERE FIRED
LJ034-0007 THE COMMISSION EVALUATED THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE FOUND NEAR THE WINDOW AFTER THE ASSASSINATION AND THE TESTIMONY OF EYEWITNESSES
LJ034-0008 IN DECIDING WHETHER LEE HARVEY OSWALD WAS PRESENT AT THIS WINDOW AT THE TIME OF THE ASSASSINATION
LJ034-0009 PALMPRINTS AND FINGERPRINTS ON CARTONS AND PAPER BAG
LJ034-0010 BELOW THE SOUTHEAST CORNER WINDOW ON THE SIXTH FLOOR WAS A LARGE CARTON OF BOOKS
LJ034-0011 MEASURING APPROXIMATELY EIGHTEEN BY TWELVE BY FOURTEEN INCHES WHICH HAD BEEN MOVED FROM A STACK ALONG THE SOUTH WALL
LJ034-0012 ATOP THIS CARTON WAS A SMALL CARTON MARKED ROLLING READERS MEASURING APPROXIMATELY THIRTEEN BY NINE BY EIGHT INCHES
LJ034-0013 IN FRONT OF THIS SMALL CARTON AND RESTING PARTIALLY ON THE WINDOWSILL WAS ANOTHER SMALL ROLLING READERS CARTON
LJ034-0014 THESE TWO SMALL CARTONS HAD BEEN MOVED FROM A STACK ABOUT THREE AISLES AWAY
LJ034-0015 THE BOXES IN THE WINDOW APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN ARRANGED AS A CONVENIENT GUN REST
LJ034-0016 BEHIND THESE BOXES WAS ANOTHER CARTON PLACED ON THE FLOOR ON WHICH A MAN SITTING
LJ034-0017 COULD LOOK SOUTHWESTERLY DOWN ELM STREET OVER THE TOP OF THE ROLLING READERS CARTONS
LJ034-0018 NEXT TO THESE CARTONS WAS THE HANDMADE PAPER BAG PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED
LJ034-0019 ON WHICH APPEARED THE PRINT OF THE LEFT INDEX FINGER AND RIGHT PALM OF LEE HARVEY OSWALD
LJ034-0020 THE CARTONS WERE FORWARDED TO THE FBI IN WASHINGTON
LJ034-0021 SEBASTIAN F. LATONA SUPERVISOR OF THE LATENT FINGERPRINT SECTION
LJ034-0022 TESTIFIED THAT 20 IDENTIFIABLE FINGERPRINTS AND 8 PALMPRINTS WERE DEVELOPED ON THESE CARTONS
LJ034-0023 THE CARTON ON THE WINDOWSILL AND THE LARGE CARTON BELOW THE WINDOW CONTAINED NO PRINTS WHICH COULD BE IDENTIFIED AS BEING THOSE OF LEE HARVEY OSWALD
LJ034-0024 THE OTHER ROLLING READERS CARTON HOWEVER CONTAINED A PALMPRINT AND A FINGERPRINT WHICH WERE IDENTIFIED BY LATONA
LJ034-0025 AS BEING THE LEFT PALMPRINT AND RIGHT INDEX FINGERPRINT OF LEE HARVEY OSWALD
LJ034-0026 THE COMMISSION HAS CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE CARTONS MIGHT HAVE BEEN MOVED IN CONNECTION WITH THE WORK THAT WAS BEING PERFORMED ON THE SIXTH FLOOR ON NOVEMBER 22
LJ034-0027 DEPOSITORY EMPLOYEES WERE LAYING A NEW FLOOR AT THE WEST END AND TRANSFERRING BOOKS FROM THE WEST TO THE EAST END OF THE BUILDING
LJ034-0028 THE ROLLING READERS CARTONS HOWEVER HAD NOT BEEN MOVED BY THE FLOOR LAYERS AND HAD APPARENTLY BEEN TAKEN TO THE WINDOW FROM THEIR REGULAR POSITION FOR SOME PARTICULAR PURPOSE
LJ034-0029 THE ROLLING READERS BOXES CONTAINED INSTEAD OF BOOKS LIGHT BLOCKS USED AS READING AIDS
LJ034-0030 THEY COULD BE EASILY ADJUSTED AND WERE STILL SOLID ENOUGH TO SERVE AS A GUN REST
LJ034-0031 THE BOX ON THE FLOOR BEHIND THE THREE NEAR THE WINDOW
LJ034-0032 HAD BEEN ONE OF THESE MOVED BY THE FLOOR LAYERS FROM THE WEST WALL TO NEAR THE EAST SIDE OF THE BUILDING IN PREPARATION FOR THE LAYING OF THE FLOOR
LJ034-0033 DURING THE AFTERNOON OF NOVEMBER TWENTY TWO
LJ034-0034 LIEUTENANT DAY OF THE DALLAS POLICE DUSTED THIS CARTON WITH POWDER AND DEVELOPED A PALMPRINT ON THE TOP EDGE OF THE CARTON ON THE SIDE NEAREST THE WINDOW
LJ034-0035 THE POSITION OF THIS PALMPRINT ON THE CARTON WAS PARALLEL WITH THE LONG AXIS OF THE BOX AND AT RIGHT ANGLES WITH THE SHORT AXIS
LJ034-0036 THE BOTTOM OF THE PALM RESTED ON THE BOX
LJ034-0037 SOMEONE SITTING ON THE BOX FACING THE WINDOW WOULD HAVE HIS PALM IN THIS POSITION IF HE PLACED HIS HAND ALONGSIDE HIS RIGHT HIP
LJ034-0038 THIS PRINT WHICH HAD BEEN CUT OUT OF THE BOX WAS ALSO FORWARDED TO THE FBI AND LATONA IDENTIFIED IT AS OSWALD'S RIGHT PALMPRINT
LJ034-0039 IN LATONA'S OPINION QUOTE
LJ034-0040 NOT TOO LONG END QUOTE A TIME HAD ELAPSED BETWEEN THE TIME THAT THE PRINT WAS PLACED ON THE CARTON AND THE TIME THAT IT HAD BEEN DEVELOPED BY THE DALLAS POLICE
LJ034-0041 ALTHOUGH BUREAU EXPERIMENTS HAD SHOWN THAT TWENTY FOUR HOURS WAS A LIKELY MAXIMUM TIME LATONA STATED
LJ034-0042 THAT HE COULD ONLY TESTIFY WITH CERTAINTY THAT THE PRINT WAS LESS THAN THREE DAYS OLD
LJ034-0043 THE PRINT THEREFORE COULD HAVE BEEN PLACED ON THE CARTON AT ANY TIME WITHIN THIS PERIOD
LJ034-0044 THE FRESHNESS OF THIS PRINT COULD BE ESTIMATED ONLY BECAUSE THE DALLAS POLICE DEVELOPED IT THROUGH THE USE OF POWDER
LJ034-0045 SINCE CARTONS ABSORB PERSPIRATION POWDER CAN SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP A PRINT ON SUCH MATERIAL ONLY WITHIN A LIMITED TIME
LJ034-0046 WHEN THE FBI IN WASHINGTON RECEIVED THE CARTONS THE REMAINING PRINTS INCLUDING OSWALD'S ON THE ROLLING READERS CARTON
LJ034-0047 WERE DEVELOPED BY CHEMICAL PROCESSES
LJ034-0048 THE FRESHNESS OF PRINTS DEVELOPED IN THIS MANNER CANNOT BE ESTIMATED
LJ034-0049 SO NO CONCLUSIONS CAN BE DRAWN AS TO WHETHER THESE REMAINING PRINTS PRECEDED OR FOLLOWED THE PRINT DEVELOPED IN DALLAS BY POWDER
LJ034-0050 MOST OF THE PRINTS WERE FOUND TO HAVE BEEN PLACED ON THE CARTONS BY AN FBI CLERK
LJ034-0051 AND A DALLAS POLICE OFFICER AFTER THE CARTONS HAD BEEN PROCESSED WITH POWDER BY THE DALLAS POLICE
LJ034-0052 IN HIS INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION ARTHUR MANDELLA OF THE NEW YORK CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT
LJ034-0053 REACHED THE SAME CONCLUSION AS LATONA THAT THE PRINTS FOUND ON THE CARTONS WERE THOSE OF LEE HARVEY OSWALD
LJ034-0054 IN ADDITION MANDELLA WAS OF THE OPINION THAT THE PRINT TAKEN FROM THE CARTON ON THE FLOOR
LJ034-0055 WAS PROBABLY MADE WITHIN A DAY OR A DAY AND A HALF OF THE EXAMINATION ON NOVEMBER TWENTY TWO
LJ034-0056 ANOTHER EXPERT WITH THE FBI RONALD G. WITTMUS CONDUCTED A SEPARATE EXAMINATION AND ALSO AGREED WITH LATONA THAT THE PRINTS WERE OSWALD'S
LJ034-0057 IN EVALUATING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE FINGERPRINT AND PALMPRINT IDENTIFICATIONS
LJ034-0058 THE COMMISSION CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITY THAT OSWALD HANDLED THESE CARTONS AS PART OF HIS NORMAL DUTIES
LJ034-0059 SINCE OTHER IDENTIFIABLE PRINTS WERE DEVELOPED ON THE CARTONS THE COMMISSION REQUESTED THAT THEY BE COMPARED WITH THE PRINTS OF THE 12 WAREHOUSE EMPLOYEES
LJ034-0060 WHO LIKE OSWALD MIGHT HAVE HANDLED THE CARTONS. THEY WERE ALSO COMPARED WITH THE PRINTS OF THOSE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS WHO MIGHT HAVE HANDLED THE CARTONS
LJ034-0061 THE RESULTS OF THIS INVESTIGATION ARE FULLY DISCUSSED IN CHAPTER 6 PAGE 249
LJ034-0062 ALTHOUGH A PERSON COULD HANDLE A CARTON AND NOT LEAVE IDENTIFIABLE PRINTS
LJ034-0063 NONE OF THESE EMPLOYEES EXCEPT OSWALD LEFT IDENTIFIABLE PRINTS ON THE CARTONS
LJ034-0064 THIS FINDING IN ADDITION TO THE FRESHNESS OF ONE OF THE PRINTS AND THE PRESENCE OF OSWALD'S PRINTS ON TWO OF THE FOUR CARTONS AND THE PAPER BAG
LJ034-0065 LED THE COMMISSION TO ATTACH SOME PROBATIVE VALUE TO THE FINGERPRINT AND PALMPRINT IDENTIFICATIONS IN REACHING THE CONCLUSION
LJ034-0066 THAT OSWALD WAS AT THE WINDOW FROM WHICH THE SHOTS WERE FIRED ALTHOUGH THE PRINTS DO NOT ESTABLISH THE EXACT TIME HE WAS THERE
LJ034-0067 OSWALD'S PRESENCE ON SIXTH FLOOR APPROXIMATELY 35 MINUTES BEFORE THE ASSASSINATION
LJ034-0068 ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY LINKING OSWALD WITH THE POINT FROM WHICH THE SHOTS WERE FIRED
LJ034-0069 WAS PROVIDED BY THE TESTIMONY OF CHARLES GIVENS WHO WAS THE LAST KNOWN EMPLOYEE TO SEE OSWALD INSIDE THE BUILDING PRIOR TO THE ASSASSINATION
LJ034-0070 DURING THE MORNING OF NOVEMBER 22 GIVENS WAS WORKING WITH THE FLOORLAYING CREW IN THE SOUTHWEST SECTION OF THE SIXTH FLOOR
LJ034-0071 AT ABOUT 1145 A.M. THE FLOORLAYING CREW USED BOTH ELEVATORS TO COME DOWN FROM THE SIXTH FLOOR
LJ034-0072 THE EMPLOYEES RACED THE ELEVATORS TO THE FIRST FLOOR. GIVENS SAW OSWALD STANDING AT THE GATE ON THE FIFTH FLOOR AS THE ELEVATOR WENT BY
LJ034-0073 GIVENS TESTIFIED THAT AFTER REACHING THE FIRST FLOOR QUOTE
LJ034-0074 I DISCOVERED I LEFT MY CIGARETTES IN MY JACKET POCKET UPSTAIRS AND I TOOK THE ELEVATOR BACK UPSTAIRS TO GET MY JACKET WITH MY CIGARETTES IN IT END QUOTE
LJ034-0075 HE SAW OSWALD A CLIPBOARD IN HAND WALKING FROM THE SOUTHEAST CORNER OF THE SIXTH FLOOR TOWARD THE ELEVATOR
LJ034-0076 GIVENS SAID TO OSWALD QUOTE BOY ARE YOU GOING DOWNSTAIRS IT'S NEAR LUNCH TIME END QUOTE
LJ034-0077 OSWALD SAID QUOTE NO SIR. WHEN YOU GET DOWNSTAIRS CLOSE THE GATE TO THE ELEVATOR END QUOTE
LJ034-0078 OSWALD WAS REFERRING TO THE WEST ELEVATOR WHICH OPERATES BY PUSHBUTTON AND ONLY WITH THE GATE CLOSED. GIVENS SAID OKAY
LJ034-0079 AND RODE DOWN IN THE EAST ELEVATOR
LJ034-0080 WHEN HE REACHED THE FIRST FLOOR THE WEST ELEVATOR  THE ONE WITH THE GATE WAS NOT THERE
LJ034-0081 GIVENS THOUGHT THIS WAS ABOUT ELEVEN FIFTY FIVE A.M.
LJ034-0082 NONE OF THE DEPOSITORY EMPLOYEES IS KNOWN TO HAVE SEEN OSWALD AGAIN UNTIL AFTER THE SHOOTING
LJ034-0083 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF GIVENS' OBSERVATION THAT OSWALD WAS CARRYING HIS CLIPBOARD
LJ034-0084 BECAME APPARENT ON DECEMBER TWO NINETEEN SIXTY THREE WHEN AN EMPLOYEE FRANKIE KAISER
LJ034-0085 FOUND A CLIPBOARD HIDDEN BY BOOK CARTONS IN THE NORTHWEST CORNER OF THE SIXTH FLOOR AT THE WEST WALL A FEW FEET FROM WHERE THE RIFLE HAD BEEN FOUND
LJ034-0086 THIS CLIPBOARD HAD BEEN MADE BY KAISER AND HAD HIS NAME ON IT
LJ034-0087 KAISER IDENTIFIED IT AS THE CLIPBOARD WHICH OSWALD HAD APPROPRIATED FROM HIM WHEN OSWALD CAME TO WORK AT THE DEPOSITORY
LJ034-0088 THREE INVOICES ON THIS CLIPBOARD EACH DATED NOVEMBER 22 WERE FOR SCOTTFORESMAN BOOKS LOCATED ON THE FIRST AND SIXTH FLOORS
LJ034-0089 OSWALD HAD NOT FILLED ANY OF THE THREE ORDERS
LJ034-0090 EYEWITNESS IDENTIFICATION OF ASSASSIN
LJ034-0091 HOWARD L. BRENNAN WAS AN EYEWITNESS TO THE SHOOTING. AS INDICATED PREVIOUSLY THE COMMISSION CONSIDERED HIS TESTIMONY AS PROBATIVE
LJ034-0092 IN REACHING THE CONCLUSION THAT THE SHOTS CAME FROM THE SIXTH FLOOR SOUTHEAST CORNER WINDOW OF THE DEPOSITORY BUILDING
LJ034-0093 BRENNAN ALSO TESTIFIED THAT LEE HARVEY OSWALD
LJ034-0094 WHOM HE VIEWED IN A POLICE LINEUP ON THE NIGHT OF THE ASSASSINATION WAS THE MAN HE SAW FIRE THE SHOTS FROM THE SIXTHFLOOR WINDOW OF THE DEPOSITORY BUILDING
LJ034-0095 WHEN THE SHOTS WERE FIRED BRENNAN WAS IN AN EXCELLENT POSITION TO OBSERVE ANYONE IN THE WINDOW. HE WAS SITTING ON A CONCRETE WALL
LJ034-0096 ON THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF ELM AND HOUSTON STREETS LOOKING NORTH AT THE DEPOSITORY BUILDING WHICH WAS DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF HIM
LJ034-0097 THE WINDOW WAS APPROXIMATELY 120 FEET AWAY
LJ034-0098 IN THE 6 TO 8 MINUTE PERIOD BEFORE THE MOTORCADE ARRIVED BRENNAN SAW A MAN LEAVE AND RETURN TO THE WINDOW QUOTE A COUPLE OF TIMES END QUOTE
LJ034-0099 AFTER HEARING THE FIRST SHOT WHICH HE THOUGHT WAS A MOTORCYCLE BACKFIRE BRENNAN GLANCED UP AT THE WINDOW. HE TESTIFIED THAT QUOTE
LJ034-0100 THIS MAN I SAW PREVIOUSLY WAS AIMING FOR HIS LAST SHOT. AS IT APPEARED TO ME HE WAS STANDING UP AND RESTING AGAINST THE LEFT WINDOW SILL END QUOTE
LJ034-0101 BRENNAN SAW THE MAN FIRE THE LAST SHOT AND DISAPPEAR FROM THE WINDOW
LJ034-0102 WITHIN MINUTES OF THE ASSASSINATION BRENNAN DESCRIBED THE MAN TO THE POLICE
LJ034-0103 THIS DESCRIPTION MOST PROBABLY LED TO THE RADIO ALERT SENT TO POLICE CARS AT APPROXIMATELY 1245 P.M. WHICH DESCRIBED THE SUSPECT AS WHITE
LJ034-0104 SLENDER WEIGHING ABOUT ONE SIXTYFIVE POUNDS ABOUT 5 FOOT 10 INCHES TALL AND IN HIS EARLY THIRTIES
LJ034-0105 IN HIS SWORN STATEMENT TO THE POLICE LATER THAT DAY
LJ034-0106 BRENNAN DESCRIBED THE MAN IN SIMILAR TERMS EXCEPT THAT HE GAVE THE WEIGHT AS BETWEEN 165 AND 175 POUNDS AND THE HEIGHT WAS OMITTED
LJ034-0107 IN HIS TESTIMONY BEFORE THE COMMISSION BRENNAN DESCRIBED THE PERSON HE SAW AS QUOTE
LJ034-0108 MAN IN HIS EARLY THIRTIES FAIR COMPLEXION SLENDER BUT NEAT NEAT SLENDER POSSIBLE 5 FOOT 10
LJ034-0109 ONESIXTY TO ONESEVENTY POUNDS
LJ034-0110 OSWALD WAS 5 FOOT 9 INCHES SLENDER AND 24 YEARS OLD
LJ034-0111 WHEN ARRESTED HE GAVE HIS WEIGHT AS 140 POUNDS. ON OTHER OCCASIONS HE GAVE WEIGHTS OF BOTH 140 AND 150 POUNDS
LJ034-0112 THE NEW ORLEANS POLICE RECORDS OF HIS ARREST IN AUGUST OF NINETEEN SIXTY THREE SHOW A WEIGHT OF 136 POUNDS
LJ034-0113 THE AUTOPSY REPORT INDICATED AN ESTIMATED WEIGHT OF 150 POUNDS
LJ034-0114 BRENNAN'S DESCRIPTION SHOULD ALSO BE COMPARED WITH THE EYEWITNESS DESCRIPTION BROADCAST OVER THE DALLAS POLICE RADIO AT 122 P.M
LJ034-0115 OF THE MAN WHO SHOT PATROLMAN J. D. TIPPIT
LJ034-0116 THE SUSPECT WAS DESCRIBED AS QUOTE A WHITE MALE ABOUT 30 5 FOOT 8 BLACK HAIR SLENDER END QUOTE
LJ034-0117 AT 129 P.M. THE POLICE RADIO REPORTED
LJ034-0118 THAT THE DESCRIPTION OF THE SUSPECT IN THE TIPPIT SHOOTING WAS SIMILAR TO THE DESCRIPTION WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN BY BRENNAN IN CONNECTION WITH THE ASSASSINATION
LJ034-0119 APPROXIMATELY 7 OR 8 MINUTES LATER
LJ034-0120 THE POLICE RADIO REPORTED THAT QUOTE AN EYEBALL WITNESS END QUOTE DESCRIBED THE SUSPECT IN THE TIPPIT SHOOTING AS QUOTE A WHITE MALE
LJ034-0121 27 5 FOOT 11 165 POUNDS BLACK WAVY HAIR END QUOTE
LJ034-0122 AS WILL BE DISCUSSED FULLY BELOW THE COMMISSION HAS CONCLUDED THAT THIS SUSPECT WAS LEE HARVEY OSWALD
LJ034-0123 ALTHOUGH BRENNAN TESTIFIED THAT THE MAN IN THE WINDOW WAS STANDING WHEN HE FIRED THE SHOTS MOST PROBABLY HE WAS EITHER SITTING OR KNEELING
LJ034-0124 THE HALFOPEN WINDOW THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE BOXES AND THE ANGLE OF THE SHOTS VIRTUALLY PRECLUDE A STANDING POSITION
LJ034-0125 IT IS UNDERSTANDABLE HOWEVER FOR BRENNAN TO HAVE BELIEVED THAT THE MAN WITH THE RIFLE WAS STANDING. A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE BUILDING TAKEN SECONDS AFTER THE ASSASSINATION
LJ034-0126 SHOWS THREE EMPLOYEES LOOKING OUT OF THE FIFTHFLOOR WINDOW DIRECTLY BELOW THE WINDOW FROM WHICH THE SHOTS WERE FIRED
LJ034-0127 BRENNAN TESTIFIED THAT THEY WERE STANDING WHICH IS THEIR APPARENT POSITION IN THE PHOTOGRAPH
LJ034-0128 BUT THE TESTIMONY OF THESE EMPLOYEES TOGETHER WITH PHOTOGRAPHS SUBSEQUENTLY TAKEN OF THEM AT THE SCENE OF THE ASSASSINATION
LJ034-0129 ESTABLISHES THAT THEY WERE EITHER SQUATTING OR KNEELING
LJ034-0130 SINCE THE WINDOW LEDGES IN THE DEPOSITORY BUILDING ARE LOWER THAN IN MOST BUILDINGS
LJ034-0131 A PERSON SQUATTING OR KNEELING EXPOSES MORE OF HIS BODY THAN WOULD NORMALLY BE THE CASE
LJ034-0132 FROM THE STREET THIS CREATES THE IMPRESSION THAT THE PERSON IS STANDING
LJ034-0133 BRENNAN COULD HAVE SEEN ENOUGH OF THE BODY OF A KNEELING OR SQUATTING PERSON TO ESTIMATE HIS HEIGHT
LJ034-0134 SHORTLY AFTER THE ASSASSINATION BRENNAN NOTICED
LJ034-0135 TWO OF THESE EMPLOYEES LEAVING THE BUILDING AND IMMEDIATELY IDENTIFIED THEM AS HAVING BEEN IN THE FIFTHFLOOR WINDOWS
LJ034-0136 WHEN THE THREE EMPLOYEES APPEARED BEFORE THE COMMISSION BRENNAN IDENTIFIED THE TWO WHOM HE SAW LEAVE THE BUILDING
LJ034-0137 THE TWO MEN HAROLD NORMAN AND JAMES JARMAN JR. EACH CONFIRMED THAT WHEN THEY CAME OUT OF THE BUILDING
LJ034-0138 THEY SAW AND HEARD BRENNAN DESCRIBING WHAT HE HAD SEEN
LJ034-0140 JARMAN HEARD BRENNAN QUOTE TALKING TO THIS OFFICER ABOUT THAT HE HAD HEARD THESE SHOTS AND HE HAD SEEN THE BARREL OF THE GUN STICKING OUT THE WINDOW
LJ034-0141 AND HE SAID THAT THE SHOTS CAME FROM INSIDE THE BUILDING END QUOTE
LJ034-0142 DURING THE EVENING OF NOVEMBER 22 BRENNAN IDENTIFIED OSWALD AS THE PERSON IN THE LINEUP WHO BORE THE CLOSEST RESEMBLANCE TO THE MAN IN THE WINDOW
LJ034-0143 BUT HE SAID HE WAS UNABLE TO MAKE A POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION
LJ034-0144 PRIOR TO THE LINEUP
LJ034-0145 BRENNAN HAD SEEN OSWALD'S PICTURE ON TELEVISION AND HE TOLD THE COMMISSION THAT WHETHER THIS AFFECTED HIS IDENTIFICATION QUOTE IS SOMETHING I DO NOT KNOW
LJ034-0146 IN AN INTERVIEW WITH FBI AGENTS ON DECEMBER 17 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ034-0147 BRENNAN STATED THAT HE WAS SURE THAT THE PERSON FIRING THE RIFLE WAS OSWALD
LJ034-0148 IN ANOTHER INTERVIEW WITH FBI AGENTS ON JANUARY 7 NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR
LJ034-0149 BRENNAN APPEARED TO REVERT TO HIS EARLIER INABILITY TO MAKE A POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION
LJ034-0150 BUT IN HIS TESTIMONY BEFORE THE COMMISSION BRENNAN STATED THAT HIS REMARKS OF JANUARY 7 WERE INTENDED BY HIM MERELY AS AN ACCURATE REPORT
LJ034-0151 OF WHAT HE SAID ON NOVEMBER 22
LJ034-0152 BRENNAN TOLD THE COMMISSION THAT HE COULD HAVE MADE A POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION IN THE LINEUP ON NOVEMBER 22
LJ034-0153 BUT DID NOT DO SO BECAUSE HE FELT THAT THE ASSASSINATION WAS QUOTE A COMMUNIST ACTIVITY
LJ034-0154 AND I FELT LIKE THERE HADN'T BEEN MORE THAN ONE EYEWITNESS AND IF IT GOT TO BE A KNOWN FACT THAT I WAS AN EYEWITNESS MY FAMILY OR I EITHER ONE MIGHT NOT BE SAFE
LJ034-0155 WHEN SPECIFICALLY ASKED BEFORE THE COMMISSION
LJ034-0156 WHETHER OR NOT HE COULD POSITIVELY IDENTIFY THE MAN HE SAW IN THE SIXTHFLOOR WINDOW AS THE SAME MAN HE SAW IN THE POLICE STATION
LJ034-0157 BRENNAN STATED QUOTE I COULD AT THAT TIME  I COULD WITH ALL SINCERITY IDENTIFY HIM AS BEING THE SAME MAN END QUOTE
LJ034-0158 ALTHOUGH THE RECORD INDICATES THAT BRENNAN WAS AN ACCURATE OBSERVER HE DECLINED TO MAKE A POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION OF OSWALD WHEN HE FIRST SAW HIM IN THE POLICE LINEUP
LJ034-0159 THE COMMISSION THEREFORE DOES NOT BASE ITS CONCLUSION CONCERNING THE IDENTITY OF THE ASSASSIN
LJ034-0160 ON BRENNAN'S SUBSEQUENT CERTAIN IDENTIFICATION OF LEE HARVEY OSWALD AS THE MAN HE SAW FIRE THE RIFLE
LJ034-0161 IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ASSASSINATION HOWEVER
LJ034-0162 BRENNAN DESCRIBED TO THE POLICE THE MAN HE SAW IN THE WINDOW AND THEN IDENTIFIED OSWALD AS THE PERSON WHO MOST NEARLY RESEMBLED THE MAN HE SAW
LJ034-0163 THE COMMISSION IS SATISFIED THAT AT THE LEAST
LJ034-0164 BRENNAN SAW A MAN IN THE WINDOW WHO CLOSELY RESEMBLED LEE HARVEY OSWALD AND THAT BRENNAN BELIEVES THE MAN HE SAW WAS IN FACT
LJ034-0165 LEE HARVEY OSWALD
LJ034-0166 TWO OTHER WITNESSES WERE ABLE TO OFFER PARTIAL DESCRIPTIONS OF A MAN THEY SAW IN THE SOUTHEAST CORNER WINDOW
LJ034-0167 OF THE SIXTH FLOOR APPROXIMATELY 1 MINUTE BEFORE THE ASSASSINATION ALTHOUGH NEITHER WITNESS SAW THE SHOTS BEING FIRED
LJ034-0168 RONALD FISCHER AND ROBERT EDWARDS WERE STANDING ON THE CURB AT THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF ELM AND HOUSTON STREETS
LJ034-0169 THE SAME CORNER WHERE BRENNAN WAS SITTING ON A CONCRETE WALL
LJ034-0170 FISCHER TESTIFIED THAT ABOUT 10 OR 15 SECONDS BEFORE THE MOTORCADE TURNED ONTO HOUSTON STREET FROM MAIN STREET
LJ034-0171 EDWARDS SAID QUOTE LOOK AT THAT GUY THERE IN THAT WINDOW END QUOTE
LJ034-0172 FISCHER LOOKED UP AND WATCHED THE MAN IN THE WINDOW FOR 10 OR 15 SECONDS AND THEN STARTED WATCHING THE MOTORCADE WHICH CAME INTO VIEW ON HOUSTON STREET
LJ034-0173 HE SAID THAT THE MAN HELD HIS ATTENTION UNTIL THE MOTORCADE CAME BECAUSE THE MAN QUOTE
LJ034-0174 APPEARED UNCOMFORTABLE FOR ONE AND SECONDLY HE WASN'T WATCHING. HE DIDN'T LOOK LIKE HE WAS WATCHING FOR THE PARADE
LJ034-0175 HE LOOKED LIKE HE WAS LOOKING DOWN TOWARD THE TRINITY RIVER AND THE TRIPLE UNDERPASS DOWN AT THE END  TOWARD THE END OF ELM STREET AND
LJ034-0176 ALL THE TIME I WATCHED HIM HE NEVER MOVED HIS HEAD HE NEVER  HE NEVER MOVED ANYTHING. JUST WAS THERE TRANSFIXED
LJ034-0177 FISCHER PLACED THE MAN IN THE EASTERNMOST WINDOW ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE DEPOSITORY BUILDING ON EITHER THE FIFTH OR THE SIXTH FLOOR
LJ034-0178 HE SAID THAT HE COULD SEE THE MAN FROM THE MIDDLE OF HIS CHEST TO THE TOP OF HIS HEAD AND THAT AS HE WAS FACING THE WINDOW THE MAN WAS IN THE LOWER RIGHTHAND PORTION OF THE WINDOW
LJ034-0179 AND QUOTE SEEMED TO BE SITTING A LITTLE FORWARD END QUOTE
LJ034-0180 THE MAN WAS DRESSED IN A LIGHTCOLORED OPENNECK SHIRT WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN EITHER A SPORTS SHIRT OR A TSHIRT
LJ034-0181 AND HE HAD BROWN HAIR A SLENDER FACE AND NECK WITH LIGHT COMPLEXION AND LOOKED TO BE 22 OR 24 YEARS OLD
LJ034-0182 THE PERSON IN THE WINDOW WAS A WHITE MAN AND QUOTE LOOKED TO ME LIKE HE WAS LOOKING STRAIGHT AT THE TRIPLE UNDERPASS END QUOTE DOWN ELM STREET
LJ034-0183 BOXES AND CASES WERE STACKED BEHIND HIM
LJ034-0184 APPROXIMATELY 1 WEEK AFTER THE ASSASSINATION ACCORDING TO FISHER POLICEMEN SHOWED HIM A PICTURE OF OSWALD
LJ034-0185 IN HIS TESTIMONY HE SAID QUOTE I TOLD THEM THAT THAT COULD HAVE BEEN THE MAN
LJ034-0186 THAT THAT COULD HAVE BEEN THE MAN THAT I SAW IN THE WINDOW IN THE SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY BUILDING BUT THAT I WAS NOT SURE END QUOTE
LJ034-0187 FISCHER DESCRIBED THE MAN'S HAIR AS SOME SHADE OF BROWN QUOTE IT WASN'T DARK AND IT WASN'T LIGHT END QUOTE
LJ034-0188 ON NOVEMBER 22 FISCHER HAD APPARENTLY DESCRIBED THE MAN AS QUOTE LIGHTHEADED END QUOTE
LJ034-0189 FISCHER EXPLAINED THAT HE DID NOT MEAN BY THE EARLIER STATEMENT THAT THE MAN WAS BLOND BUT RATHER THAT HIS HAIR WAS NOT BLACK
LJ034-0190 ROBERT EDWARDS SAID THAT WHILE LOOKING AT THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE DEPOSITORY BUILDING SHORTLY BEFORE THE MOTORCADE
LJ034-0191 HE SAW NOTHING OF IMPORTANCE QUOTE EXCEPT MAYBE ONE INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS UP THERE IN THE CORNER ROOM OF THE SIXTH FLOOR WHICH WAS CROWDED IN AMONG BOXES END QUOTE
LJ034-0192 HE SAID THAT THIS WAS A WHITE MAN ABOUT AVERAGE IN SIZE QUOTE POSSIBLY THIN END QUOTE AND THAT HE THOUGHT THE MAN HAD LIGHTBROWN HAIR
LJ034-0193 FISCHER AND EDWARDS DID NOT SEE THE MAN CLEARLY ENOUGH OR LONG ENOUGH TO IDENTIFY HIM
LJ034-0194 THEIR TESTIMONY IS OF PROBATIVE VALUE HOWEVER BECAUSE THEIR LIMITED DESCRIPTION IS CONSISTENT WITH THAT OF THE MAN WHO HAS BEEN FOUND BY THE COMMISSION
LJ034-0195 BASED ON OTHER EVIDENCE TO HAVE FIRED THE SHOTS FROM THE WINDOW
LJ034-0196 ANOTHER PERSON WHO SAW THE ASSASSIN AS THE SHOTS WERE FIRED WAS AMOS L. EUINS AGE 15
LJ034-0197 WHO WAS ONE OF THE FIRST WITNESSES TO ALERT THE POLICE TO THE DEPOSITORY AS THE SOURCE OF THE SHOTS AS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED IN CHAPTER 3
LJ034-0198 EUINS WHO WAS ON THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF ELM AND HOUSTON STREETS TESTIFIED THAT HE COULD NOT DESCRIBE THE MAN HE SAW IN THE WINDOW
LJ034-0199 ACCORDING TO EUINS HOWEVER AS THE MAN LOWERED HIS HEAD IN ORDER TO AIM THE RIFLE DOWN ELM STREET HE APPEARED TO HAVE A WHITE BALD SPOT ON HIS HEAD
LJ034-0200 SHORTLY AFTER THE ASSASSINATION EUINS SIGNED AN AFFIDAVIT DESCRIBING THE MAN AS WHITE
LJ034-0201 BUT A RADIO REPORTER TESTIFIED THAT EUINS DESCRIBED THE MAN TO HIM AS QUOTE COLORED END QUOTE
LJ034-0202 IN HIS COMMISSION TESTIMONY
LJ034-0203 EUINS STATED THAT HE COULD NOT ASCERTAIN THE MAN'S RACE AND THAT THE STATEMENT IN THE AFFIDAVIT WAS INTENDED TO REFER ONLY TO THE WHITE SPOT ON THE MAN'S HEAD
LJ034-0204 AND NOT TO HIS RACE
LJ034-0205 A SECRET SERVICE AGENT WHO SPOKE TO EUINS APPROXIMATELY 20 TO 30 MINUTES AFTER THE ASSASSINATION
LJ034-0206 CONFIRMED THAT EUINS COULD NEITHER DESCRIBE THE MAN IN THE WINDOW NOR INDICATE HIS RACE
LJ034-0207 ACCORDINGLY EUINS' TESTIMONY IS CONSIDERED PROBATIVE AS TO THE SOURCE OF THE SHOTS BUT IS INCONCLUSIVE AS TO THE IDENTITY OF THE MAN IN THE WINDOW
LJ034-0208 IN EVALUATING THE EVIDENCE THAT OSWALD WAS AT THE SOUTHEAST CORNER WINDOW OF THE SIXTH FLOOR AT THE TIME OF THE SHOOTING
LJ034-0209 THE COMMISSION HAS CONSIDERED THE ALLEGATION THAT OSWALD WAS PHOTOGRAPHED STANDING IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING WHEN THE SHOTS WERE FIRED
LJ034-0210 THE PICTURE WHICH GAVE RISE TO THESE ALLEGATIONS WAS TAKEN BY ASSOCIATED PRESS PHOTOGRAPHER JAMES W. ALTGENS
LJ034-0211 WHO WAS STANDING ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF ELM STREET BETWEEN THE TRIPLE UNDERPASS AND THE DEPOSITORY BUILDING
LJ034-0212 AS THE MOTORCADE STARTED ITS DESCENT DOWN ELM STREET. ALTGENS SNAPPED A PICTURE OF THE PRESIDENTIAL LIMOUSINE WITH THE ENTRANCE TO THE DEPOSITORY BUILDING IN THE BACKGROUND
LJ034-0213 JUST BEFORE SNAPPING THE PICTURE ALTGENS HEARD A NOISE WHICH SOUNDED LIKE THE POPPING OF A FIRECRACKER
LJ034-0214 INVESTIGATION HAS ESTABLISHED THAT ALTGENS' PICTURE WAS TAKEN APPROXIMATELY TWO SECONDS AFTER THE FIRING OF THE SHOT
LJ034-0215 WHICH ENTERED THE BACK OF THE PRESIDENT'S NECK
LJ034-0216 IN THE BACKGROUND OF THIS PICTURE WERE SEVERAL EMPLOYEES WATCHING THE PARADE FROM THE STEPS OF THE DEPOSITORY BUILDING
LJ034-0217 ONE OF THESE EMPLOYEES WAS ALLEGED TO RESEMBLE LEE HARVEY OSWALD
LJ034-0218 THE COMMISSION HAS DETERMINED THAT THE EMPLOYEE WAS IN FACT BILLY LOVELADY WHO IDENTIFIED HIMSELF IN THE PICTURE
LJ034-0219 STANDING ALONGSIDE HIM WERE BUELL WESLEY FRAZIER AND WILLIAM SHELLEY WHO ALSO IDENTIFIED LOVELADY
LJ035-0001 REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION ON THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY. THE WARREN COMMISSION REPORT. BY THE PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION ON THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY
LJ035-0002 CHAPTER 4. THE ASSASSIN PART 4. OSWALD'S ACTIONS IN BUILDING AFTER ASSASSINATION
LJ035-0003 IN CONSIDERING WHETHER OSWALD WAS AT THE SOUTHEAST CORNER WINDOW AT THE TIME THE SHOTS WERE FIRED
LJ035-0004 THE COMMISSION HAS REVIEWED THE TESTIMONY OF WITNESSES WHO SAW OSWALD IN THE BUILDING WITHIN MINUTES AFTER THE ASSASSINATION
LJ035-0005 THE COMMISSION HAS FOUND THAT OSWALD'S MOVEMENTS AS DESCRIBED BY THESE WITNESSES
LJ035-0006 ARE CONSISTENT WITH HIS HAVING BEEN AT THE WINDOW AT 1230 P.M
LJ035-0007 THE ENCOUNTER IN THE LUNCHROOM
LJ035-0008 THE FIRST PERSON TO SEE OSWALD AFTER THE ASSASSINATION WAS PATROLMAN M. L. BAKER OF THE DALLAS POLICE DEPARTMENT
LJ035-0009 BAKER WAS RIDING A TWOWHEELED MOTORCYCLE BEHIND THE LAST PRESS CAR OF THE MOTORCADE
LJ035-0010 AS HE TURNED THE CORNER FROM MAIN ONTO HOUSTON AT A SPEED OF ABOUT 5 TO 10 MILES PER HOUR
LJ035-0011 A STRONG WIND BLOWING FROM THE NORTH ALMOST UNSEATED HIM
LJ035-0012 AT ABOUT THIS TIME HE HEARD THE FIRST SHOT
LJ035-0013 HAVING RECENTLY HEARD THE SOUNDS OF RIFLES WHILE ON A HUNTING TRIP BAKER RECOGNIZED THE SHOTS AS THAT OF A HIGHPOWERED RIFLE QUOTE
LJ035-0014 IT SOUNDED HIGH AND I IMMEDIATELY KIND OF LOOKED UP
LJ035-0015 AND I HAD A FEELING THAT IT CAME FROM THE BUILDING EITHER RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME [THE DEPOSITORY BUILDING] OR OF THE ONE ACROSS TO THE RIGHT OF IT END QUOTE
LJ035-0016 HE SAW PIGEONS FLUTTER UPWARD. HE WAS NOT CERTAIN QUOTE BUT I AM PRETTY SURE THEY CAME FROM THE BUILDING RIGHT ON THE NORTHWEST CORNER END QUOTE
LJ035-0017 HE HEARD TWO MORE SHOTS SPACED QUOTE PRETTY WELL EVEN TO ME
LJ035-0018 END QUOTE AFTER THE THIRD SHOT HE QUOTE REVVED THAT MOTORCYCLE UP END QUOTE
LJ035-0019 DROVE TO THE NORTHWEST CORNER OF ELM AND HOUSTON AND PARKED APPROXIMATELY 10 FEET FROM THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL
LJ035-0020 AS HE WAS PARKING HE NOTED THAT PEOPLE WERE QUOTE FALLING AND THEY WERE ROLLING AROUND DOWN THERE GRABBING THEIR CHILDREN END QUOTE AND RUSHING ABOUT
LJ035-0021 A WOMAN SCREAMED QUOTE OH THEY HAVE SHOT THAT MAN THEY HAVE SHOT THAT MAN END QUOTE
LJ035-0022 BAKER QUOTE HAD IT IN MIND THAT THE SHOTS CAME FROM THE TOP OF THIS BUILDING HERE END QUOTE SO HE RAN STRAIGHT TO THE ENTRANCE OF THE DEPOSITORY BUILDING
LJ035-0023 BAKER TESTIFIED THAT HE ENTERED THE LOBBY OF THE BUILDING AND QUOTE SPOKE OUT AND ASKED WHERE THE STAIRS OR ELEVATOR WAS
LJ035-0024 AND THIS MAN MR. TRULY SPOKE UP AND SAYS IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE HE SAYS
LJ035-0025 I AM A BUILDING MANAGER. FOLLOW ME OFFICER AND I WILL SHOW YOU END QUOTE
LJ035-0026 BAKER AND BUILDING SUPERINTENDENT ROY TRULY WENT THROUGH A SECOND SET OF DOORS AND STOPPED AT A SWINGING DOOR WHERE BAKER BUMPED INTO TRULY'S BACK
LJ035-0027 THEY WENT THROUGH THE SWINGING DOOR AND CONTINUED AT QUOTE A GOOD TROT END QUOTE
LJ035-0028 TO THE NORTHWEST CORNER OF THE FLOOR WHERE TRULY HOPED TO FIND ONE OF THE TWO FREIGHT ELEVATORS
LJ035-0029 NEITHER ELEVATOR WAS THERE
LJ035-0030 TRULY PUSHED THE BUTTON FOR THE WEST ELEVATOR WHICH OPERATES AUTOMATICALLY IF THE GATE IS CLOSED
LJ035-0031 HE SHOUTED TWICE QUOTE TURN LOOSE THE ELEVATOR END QUOTE
LJ035-0032 WHEN THE ELEVATOR FAILED TO COME BAKER SAID QUOTE LET'S TAKE THE STAIRS END QUOTE AND HE FOLLOWED TRULY UP THE STAIRWAY WHICH IS TO THE WEST OF THE ELEVATOR
LJ035-0033 THE STAIRWAY IS LOCATED IN THE NORTHWEST CORNER OF THE DEPOSITORY BUILDING
LJ035-0034 THE STAIRS FROM ONE FLOOR TO THE NEXT ARE LSHAPED WITH BOTH LEGS OF THE L APPROXIMATELY THE SAME LENGTH
LJ035-0035 BECAUSE THE STAIRWAY ITSELF IS ENCLOSED NEITHER BAKER NOR TRULY COULD SEE ANYTHING ON THE SECONDFLOOR HALLWAY UNTIL THEY REACHED THE LANDING AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS
LJ035-0036 ON THE SECONDFLOOR LANDING THERE IS A SMALL OPEN AREA WITH A DOOR AT THE EAST END
LJ035-0037 THIS DOOR LEADS INTO A SMALL VESTIBULE AND ANOTHER DOOR LEADS FROM THE VESTIBULE INTO THE SECONDFLOOR LUNCHROOM
LJ035-0038 THE LUNCHROOM DOOR IS USUALLY OPEN BUT THE FIRST DOOR IS KEPT SHUT BY A CLOSING MECHANISM ON THE DOOR
LJ035-0039 THIS VESTIBULE DOOR IS SOLID EXCEPT FOR A SMALL GLASS WINDOW IN THE UPPER PART OF THE DOOR
LJ035-0040 AS BAKER REACHED THE SECOND FLOOR HE WAS ABOUT 20 FEET FROM THE VESTIBULE DOOR. HE INTENDED TO CONTINUE AROUND TO HIS LEFT TOWARD THE STAIRWAY GOING UP
LJ035-0041 BUT THROUGH THE WINDOW IN THE DOOR HE CAUGHT A FLEETING GLIMPSE OF A MAN WALKING IN THE VESTIBULE TOWARD THE LUNCHROOM
LJ035-0042 SINCE THE VESTIBULE DOOR IS ONLY A FEW FEET FROM THE LUNCHROOM DOOR THE MAN MUST HAVE ENTERED THE VESTIBULE ONLY A SECOND OR TWO BEFORE BAKER ARRIVED AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRWELL
LJ035-0043 YET HE MUST HAVE ENTERED THE VESTIBULE DOOR BEFORE TRULY REACHED THE TOP OF THE STAIRWELL SINCE TRULY DID NOT SEE HIM
LJ035-0044 IF THE MAN HAD PASSED FROM THE VESTIBULE INTO THE LUNCHROOM BAKER COULD NOT HAVE SEEN HIM
LJ035-0045 BAKER SAID QUOTE HE [TRULY] HAD ALREADY STARTED AROUND THE BEND TO COME TO THE NEXT ELEVATOR GOING UP
LJ035-0046 I WAS COMING OUT THIS ONE ON THE SECOND FLOOR AND I DON'T KNOW I WAS KIND OF SWEEPING THIS AREA AS I COME UP I WAS LOOKING FROM RIGHT TO LEFT
LJ035-0047 AND AS I GOT TO THIS DOOR HERE I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THIS MAN JUST YOU KNOW A SUDDEN GLIMPSE. AND IT LOOKED TO ME LIKE HE WAS GOING AWAY FROM ME
LJ035-0048 I CAN'T SAY WHETHER HE HAD GONE ON THROUGH THAT DOOR [THE LUNCHROOM DOOR] OR NOT
LJ035-0049 ALL I DID WAS CATCH A GLANCE AT HIM AND EVIDENTLY HE WAS  THIS DOOR MIGHT HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW CLOSING AND ALMOST SHUT AT THAT TIME END QUOTE
LJ035-0050 WITH HIS REVOLVER DRAWN BAKER OPENED THE VESTIBULE DOOR AND RAN INTO THE VESTIBULE
LJ035-0051 HE SAW A MAN WALKING AWAY FROM HIM IN THE LUNCHROOM
LJ035-0052 BAKER STOPPED AT THE DOOR OF THE LUNCHROOM AND COMMANDED QUOTE COME HERE END QUOTE
LJ035-0053 THE MAN TURNED AND WALKED BACK TOWARD BAKER
LJ035-0054 HE HAD BEEN PROCEEDING TOWARD THE REAR OF THE LUNCHROOM
LJ035-0055 ALONG A SIDE WALL OF THE LUNCHROOM WAS A SOFT DRINK RENDING MACHINE BUT AT THAT TIME THE MAN HAD NOTHING IN HIS HANDS
LJ035-0056 MEANWHILE TRULY HAD RUN UP SEVERAL STEPS TOWARD THE THIRD FLOOR
LJ035-0057 MISSING BAKER HE CAME BACK TO FIND THE OFFICER IN THE DOORWAY TO THE LUNCHROOM FACING LEE HARVEY OSWALD
LJ035-0058 BAKER TURNED TO TRULY AND SAID QUOTE DO YOU KNOW THIS MAN DOES HE WORK HERE END QUOTE
LJ035-0059 TRULY REPLIED YES
LJ035-0060 BAKER STATED LATER THAT THE MAN DID NOT SEEM TO BE OUT OF BREATH HE SEEMED CALM. QUOTE HE NEVER DID SAY A WORD OR NOTHING
LJ035-0061 IN FACT HE DIDN'T CHANGE HIS EXPRESSION ONE BIT END QUOTE
LJ035-0062 TRULY SAID OF OSWALD QUOTE HE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE EXCITED OR OVERLY AFRAID OR ANYTHING. HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BIT STARTLED LIKE I MIGHT HAVE BEEN IF SOMEBODY CONFRONTED ME
LJ035-0063 BUT I CANNOT RECALL ANY CHANGE IN EXPRESSION OF ANY KIND ON HIS FACE END QUOTE
LJ035-0064 TRULY THOUGHT THAT THE OFFICER'S GUN AT THAT TIME APPEARED TO BE ALMOST TOUCHING THE MIDDLE PORTION OF OSWALD'S BODY
LJ035-0065 TRULY ALSO NOTED AT THIS TIME THAT OSWALD'S HANDS WERE EMPTY
LJ035-0066 IN AN EFFORT TO DETERMINE WHETHER OSWALD COULD HAVE DESCENDED TO THE LUNCHROOM
LJ035-0067 FROM THE SIXTH FLOOR BY THE TIME BAKER AND TRULY ARRIVED COMMISSION COUNSEL ASKED BAKER AND TRULY TO REPEAT THEIR MOVEMENTS FROM THE TIME OF THE SHOT
LJ035-0068 UNTIL BAKER CAME UPON OSWALD IN THE LUNCHROOM
LJ035-0069 BAKER PLACED HIMSELF ON A MOTORCYCLE ABOUT 200 FEET FROM THE CORNER OF ELM AND HOUSTON STREETS WHERE HE SAID HE HEARD THE SHOTS
LJ035-0070 TRULY STOOD IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING
LJ035-0071 AT A GIVEN SIGNAL THEY REENACTED THE EVENT. BAKER'S MOVEMENTS WERE TIMED WITH A STOPWATCH
LJ035-0072 ON THE FIRST TEST THE ELAPSED TIME BETWEEN THE SIMULATED FIRST SHOT AND BAKER'S ARRIVAL ON THE SECONDFLOOR STAIR LANDING
LJ035-0073 WAS ONE MINUTE AND THIRTY SECONDS
LJ035-0074 THE SECOND TEST RUN REQUIRED 1 MINUTE AND 15 SECONDS
LJ035-0075 A TEST WAS ALSO CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE TIME REQUIRED TO WALK FROM THE SOUTHEAST CORNER OF THE SIXTH FLOOR TO THE SECONDFLOOR LUNCHROOM BY STAIRWAY
LJ035-0076 SPECIAL AGENT JOHN HOWLETT OF THE SECRET SERVICE CARRIED A RIFLE FROM THE SOUTHEAST CORNER OF THE SIXTH FLOOR ALONG THE EAST AISLE TO THE NORTHEAST CORNER
LJ035-0077 HE PLACED THE RIFLE ON THE FLOOR NEAR THE SITE WHERE OSWALD'S RIFLE WAS ACTUALLY FOUND AFTER THE SHOOTING
LJ035-0078 THEN HOWLETT WALKED DOWN THE STAIRWAY TO THE SECONDFLOOR LANDING AND ENTERED THE LUNCHROOM
LJ035-0079 THE FIRST TEST RUN AT NORMAL WALKING PACE REQUIRED ONE MINUTE EIGHTEEN SECONDS
LJ035-0080 THE SECOND TEST AT A FAST WALK TOOK ONE MINUTE FOURTEEN SECONDS
LJ035-0081 THE SECOND TEST FOLLOWED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE FIRST
LJ035-0082 THE ONLY INTERVAL WAS THE TIME NECESSARY TO RIDE IN THE ELEVATOR FROM THE SECOND TO THE SIXTH FLOOR AND WALK BACK TO THE SOUTHEAST CORNER
LJ035-0083 HOWLETT WAS NOT SHORT WINDED AT THE END OF EITHER TEST RUN
LJ035-0084 THE MINIMUM TIME REQUIRED BY BAKER TO PARK HIS MOTORCYCLE AND REACH THE SECONDFLOOR LUNCHROOM WAS WITHIN 3 SECONDS OF THE TIME NEEDED TO WALK
LJ035-0085 FROM THE SOUTHEAST CORNER OF THE SIXTH FLOOR DOWN THE STAIRWAY TO THE LUNCHROOM
LJ035-0086 THE TIME ACTUALLY REQUIRED FOR BAKER AND TRULY TO REACH THE SECOND FLOOR ON NOVEMBER 22 WAS PROBABLY LONGER THAN IN THE TEST RUNS. FOR EXAMPLE
LJ035-0087 BAKER REQUIRED 15 SECONDS AFTER THE SIMULATED SHOT TO RIDE HIS MOTORCYCLE 180 TO 200 FEET
LJ035-0088 PARK IT AND RUN 45 FEET TO THE BUILDING
LJ035-0089 NO ALLOWANCE WAS MADE FOR THE SPECIAL CONDITIONS WHICH EXISTED ON THE DAY OF THE ASSASSINATION
LJ035-0090 POSSIBLE DELAYED REACTION TO THE SHOT JOSTLING WITH THE CROWD OF PEOPLE ON THE STEPS AND SCANNING THE AREA ALONG ELM STREET AND THE PARKWAY
LJ035-0091 BAKER SAID QUOTE WE SIMULATED THE SHOTS AND BY THE TIME WE GOT THERE WE DID EVERYTHING THAT I DID THAT DAY
LJ035-0092 AND THIS WOULD BE THE MINIMUM BECAUSE I AM SURE THAT I YOU KNOW IT TOOK ME A LITTLE LONGER END QUOTE
LJ035-0093 ON THE BASIS OF THIS TIME TEST THEREFORE
LJ035-0094 THE COMMISSION CONCLUDED THAT OSWALD COULD HAVE FIRED THE SHOTS AND STILL HAVE BEEN PRESENT IN THE SECONDFLOOR LUNCHROOM WHEN SEEN BY BAKER AND TRULY
LJ035-0095 THAT OSWALD DESCENDED BY STAIRWAY FROM THE SIXTH FLOOR TO THE SECONDFLOOR LUNCHROOM
LJ035-0096 IS CONSISTENT WITH THE MOVEMENTS OF THE TWO ELEVATORS WHICH WOULD HAVE PROVIDED THE OTHER POSSIBLE MEANS OF DESCENT
LJ035-0097 WHEN TRULY ACCOMPANIED BY BAKER RAN TO THE REAR OF THE FIRST FLOOR
LJ035-0098 HE WAS CERTAIN THAT BOTH ELEVATORS WHICH OCCUPY THE SAME SHAFT WERE ON THE FIFTH FLOOR
LJ035-0099 BAKER NOT REALIZING THAT THERE WERE TWO ELEVATORS THOUGHT THAT ONLY ONE ELEVATOR WAS IN THE SHAFT AND THAT IT WAS TWO OR THREE FLOORS ABOVE THE SECOND FLOOR
LJ035-0100 IN THE FEW SECONDS WHICH ELAPSED WHILE BAKER AND TRULY RAN FROM THE FIRST TO THE SECOND FLOOR
LJ035-0101 NEITHER OF THESE SLOW ELEVATORS COULD HAVE DESCENDED FROM THE FIFTH TO THE SECOND FLOOR. FURTHERMORE NO ELEVATOR WAS AT THE SECOND FLOOR WHEN THEY ARRIVED THERE
LJ035-0102 TRULY AND BAKER CONTINUED UP THE STAIRS AFTER THE ENCOUNTER WITH OSWALD IN THE LUNCHROOM
LJ035-0103 THERE WAS NO ELEVATOR ON THE THIRD OR FOURTH FLOOR
LJ035-0104 THE EAST ELEVATOR WAS ON THE FIFTH FLOOR WHEN THEY ARRIVED THE WEST ELEVATOR WAS NOT
LJ035-0105 THEY TOOK THE EAST ELEVATOR TO THE SEVENTH FLOOR AND RAN UP A STAIRWAY TO THE ROOF WHERE THEY SEARCHED FOR SEVERAL MINUTES
LJ035-0106 JACK DOUGHERTY AN EMPLOYEE WORKING ON THE FIFTH FLOOR
LJ035-0107 TESTIFIED THAT HE TOOK THE WEST ELEVATOR TO THE FIRST FLOOR AFTER HEARING A NOISE WHICH SOUNDED LIKE A BACKFIRE
LJ035-0108 EDDIE PIPER THE JANITOR TOLD DOUGHERTY THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD BEEN SHOT
LJ035-0109 BUT IN HIS TESTIMONY PIPER DID NOT MENTION EITHER SEEING OR TALKING WITH DOUGHERTY DURING THESE MOMENTS OF EXCITEMENT
LJ035-0110 BOTH DOUGHERTY AND PIPER WERE CONFUSED WITNESSES. THEY HAD NO EXACT MEMORY OF THE EVENTS OF THAT AFTERNOON
LJ035-0111 TRULY WAS PROBABLY CORRECT IN STATING THAT THE WEST ELEVATOR WAS ON THE FIFTH FLOOR WHEN HE LOOKED UP THE ELEVATOR SHAFT FROM THE FIRST FLOOR
LJ035-0112 THE WEST ELEVATOR WAS NOT ON THE FIFTH FLOOR WHEN BAKER AND TRULY REACHED THAT FLOOR
LJ035-0113 PROBABLY BECAUSE JACK DOUGHERTY TOOK IT TO THE FIRST FLOOR WHILE BAKER AND TRULY WERE RUNNING UP THE STAIRS OR IN THE LUNCHROOM WITH OSWALD
LJ035-0114 NEITHER ELEVATOR COULD HAVE BEEN USED BY OSWALD AS A MEANS OF DESCENT
LJ035-0115 OSWALD'S USE OF THE STAIRWAY IS CONSISTENT WITH THE TESTIMONY OF OTHER EMPLOYEES IN THE BUILDING
LJ035-0116 THREE EMPLOYEES  JAMES JARMAN JR
LJ035-0117 HAROLD NORMAN AND BONNIE RAY WILLIAMS  WERE WATCHING THE PARADE FROM THE FIFTH FLOOR DIRECTLY BELOW THE WINDOW FROM WHICH THE SHOTS WERE FIRED
LJ035-0118 THEY RUSHED TO THE WEST WINDOWS AFTER THE SHOTS WERE FIRED AND REMAINED THERE
LJ035-0119 UNTIL AFTER THEY SAW PATROLMAN BAKER'S WHITE HELMET ON THE FIFTH FLOOR MOVING TOWARD THE ELEVATOR
LJ035-0120 WHILE THEY WERE AT THE WEST WINDOWS THEIR VIEW OF THE STAIRWELL WAS COMPLETELY BLOCKED BY SHELVES AND BOXES
LJ035-0121 THIS IS THE PERIOD DURING WHICH OSWALD WOULD HAVE DESCENDED THE STAIRS. IN ALL LIKELIHOOD
LJ035-0122 DOUGHERTY TOOK THE ELEVATOR DOWN FROM THE FIFTH FLOOR AFTER JARMAN NORMAN AND WILLIAMS RAN TO THE WEST WINDOWS AND WERE DECIDING WHAT TO DO
LJ035-0123 NONE OF THESE THREE MEN SAW DOUGHERTY PROBABLY BECAUSE OF THE ANXIETY OF THE MOMENT AND BECAUSE OF THE BOOKS WHICH MAY HAVE BLOCKED THE VIEW
LJ035-0124 NEITHER JARMAN NORMAN WILLIAMS OR DOUGHERTY SAW OSWALD
LJ035-0125 VICTORIA ADAMS WHO WORKED ON THE FOURTH FLOOR OF THE DEPOSITORY BUILDING
LJ035-0126 CLAIMED THAT WITHIN ABOUT 1 MINUTE FOLLOWING THE SHOTS SHE RAN FROM A WINDOW ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE FOURTH FLOOR
LJ035-0127 DOWN THE REAR STAIRS TO THE FIRST FLOOR WHERE SHE ENCOUNTERED TWO DEPOSITORY EMPLOYEES  WILLIAM SHELLEY AND BILLY LOVELADY
LJ035-0128 IF HER ESTIMATE OF TIME IS CORRECT SHE REACHED THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS BEFORE TRULY AND BAKER STARTED UP
LJ035-0129 AND SHE MUST HAVE RUN DOWN THE STAIRS AHEAD OF OSWALD AND WOULD PROBABLY HAVE SEEN OR HEARD HIM
LJ035-0130 ACTUALLY SHE NOTICED NO ONE ON THE BACK STAIRS. IF SHE DESCENDED FROM THE FOURTH TO THE FIRST FLOOR AS FAST AS SHE CLAIMED IN HER TESTIMONY
LJ035-0131 SHE WOULD HAVE SEEN BAKER OR TRULY ON THE FIRST FLOOR OR ON THE STAIRS UNLESS THEY WERE ALREADY IN THE SECONDFLOOR LUNCHROOM TALKING TO OSWALD
LJ035-0132 WHEN SHE REACHED THE FIRST FLOOR SHE ACTUALLY SAW SHELLEY AND LOVELADY SLIGHTLY EAST OF THE EAST ELEVATOR
LJ035-0133 SHELLEY AND LOVELADY HOWEVER HAVE TESTIFIED
LJ035-0134 THAT THEY WERE WATCHING THE PARADE FROM THE TOP STEP OF THE BUILDING ENTRANCE WHEN GLORIA CALVERLY WHO WORKS IN THE DEPOSITORY BUILDING
LJ035-0135 RAN UP AND SAID THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD BEEN SHOT
LJ035-0136 LOVELADY AND SHELLEY MOVED OUT INTO THE STREET
LJ035-0137 ABOUT THIS TIME SHELLEY SAW TRULY AND PATROLMAN BAKER GO INTO THE BUILDING
LJ035-0138 SHELLEY AND LOVELADY AT A FAST WALK OR TROT TURNED WEST INTO THE RAILROAD YARDS AND THEN TO THE WEST SIDE OF THE DEPOSITORY BUILDING
LJ035-0139 THEY REENTERED THE BUILDING BY THE REAR DOOR SEVERAL MINUTES AFTER BAKER AND TRULY RUSHED THROUGH THE FRONT ENTRANCE
LJ035-0140 ON ENTERING LOVELADY SAW A GIRL ON THE FIRST FLOOR WHO HE BELIEVES WAS VICTORIA ADAMS
LJ035-0141 IF MISS ADAMS ACCURATELY RECALLED MEETING SHELLEY AND LOVELADY WHEN SHE REACHED THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS
LJ035-0142 THEN HER ESTIMATE OF THE TIME WHEN SHE DESCENDED FROM THE FOURTH FLOOR IS INCORRECT
LJ035-0143 AND SHE ACTUALLY CAME DOWN THE STAIRS SEVERAL MINUTES AFTER OSWALD AND AFTER TRULY AND BAKER AS WELL
LJ035-0144 OSWALD'S DEPARTURE FROM BUILDING
LJ035-0145 WITHIN A MINUTE AFTER BAKER AND TRULY LEFT OSWALD IN THE LUNCHROOM MRS. R. A. REID CLERICAL SUPERVISOR FOR THE TEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY
LJ035-0146 SAW HIM WALK THROUGH THE CLERICAL OFFICE ON THE SECOND FLOOR TOWARD THE DOOR LEADING TO THE FRONT STAIRWAY
LJ035-0147 MRS. REID HAD WATCHED THE PARADE FROM THE SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING WITH TRULY AND MR. O. V. CAMPBELL VICE PRESIDENT OF THE DEPOSITORY
LJ035-0148 SHE TESTIFIED THAT SHE HEARD THREE SHOTS WHICH SHE THOUGHT CAME FROM THE BUILDING
LJ035-0149 SHE RAN INSIDE AND UP THE FRONT STAIRS INTO THE LARGE OPEN OFFICE RESERVED FOR CLERICAL EMPLOYEES
LJ035-0150 AS SHE APPROACHED HER DESK SHE SAW OSWALD
LJ035-0151 HE WAS WALKING INTO THE OFFICE FROM THE BACK HALLWAY
LJ035-0152 CARRYING A FULL BOTTLE OF COCACOLA IN HIS HAND PRESUMABLY PURCHASED AFTER THE ENCOUNTER WITH BAKER AND TRULY
LJ035-0153 AS OSWALD PASSED MRS. REID SHE SAID QUOTE OH THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN SHOT BUT MAYBE THEY DIDN'T HIT HIM END QUOTE
LJ035-0154 OSWALD MUMBLED SOMETHING AND WALKED BY SHE PAID NO MORE ATTENTION TO HIM
LJ035-0155 THE ONLY EXIT FROM THE OFFICE IN THE DIRECTION OSWALD WAS MOVING WAS THROUGH THE DOOR TO THE FRONT STAIRWAY
LJ035-0156 MRS. REID TESTIFIED THAT WHEN SHE SAW OSWALD HE WAS WEARING A TSHIRT AND NO JACKET
LJ035-0157 WHEN HE LEFT HOME THAT MORNING MARINA OSWALD WHO WAS STILL IN BED SUGGESTED THAT HE WEAR A JACKET
LJ035-0158 A BLUE JACKET LATER IDENTIFIED BY MARINA OSWALD AS HER HUSBAND'S WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND IN THE BUILDING APPARENTLY LEFT BEHIND BY OSWALD
LJ035-0159 MRS. REID BELIEVES THAT SHE RETURNED TO HER DESK FROM THE STREET ABOUT 2 MINUTES AFTER THE SHOOTING
LJ035-0160 RECONSTRUCTING HER MOVEMENTS MRS. REID RAN THE DISTANCE THREE TIMES AND WAS TIMED IN 2 MINUTES BY STOPWATCH
LJ035-0161 THE RECONSTRUCTION WAS THE MINIMUM TIME ACCORDINGLY SHE PROBABLY MET OSWALD AT ABOUT 1232
LJ035-0162 APPROXIMATELY 30 TO 45 SECONDS AFTER OSWALD'S LUNCHROOM ENCOUNTER WITH BAKER AND TRULY
LJ035-0163 AFTER LEAVING MRS. REID IN THE FRONT OFFICE OSWALD COULD HAVE GONE DOWN THE STAIRS AND OUT THE FRONT DOOR BY 1233 P.M.
LJ035-0164 3 MINUTES AFTER THE SHOOTING
LJ035-0165 AT THAT TIME THE BUILDING HAD NOT YET BEEN SEALED OFF BY THE POLICE
LJ035-0166 WHILE IT WAS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE EXACTLY WHEN THE POLICE SEALED OFF THE BUILDING
LJ035-0167 THE EARLIEST ESTIMATES WOULD STILL HAVE PERMITTED OSWALD TO LEAVE THE BUILDING BY 1233
LJ035-0168 ONE OF THE POLICE OFFICERS ASSIGNED TO THE CORNER OF ELM AND HOUSTON STREETS FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL MOTORCADE W. E. BARNETT
LJ035-0169 TESTIFIED THAT IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SHOTS HE WENT TO THE REAR OF THE BUILDING TO CHECK THE FIRE ESCAPE
LJ035-0170 HE THEN RETURNED TO THE CORNER OF ELM AND HOUSTON WHERE HE MET A SERGEANT WHO INSTRUCTED HIM TO FIND OUT THE NAME OF THE BUILDING
LJ035-0171 BARNETT RAN TO THE BUILDING NOTED ITS NAME AND THEN RETURNED TO THE CORNER
LJ035-0172 THERE HE WAS MET BY A CONSTRUCTION WORKER  IN ALL LIKELIHOOD HOWARD BRENNAN WHO WAS WEARING HIS WORK HELMET
LJ035-0173 THIS WORKER TOLD BARNETT THAT THE SHOTS HAD BEEN FIRED FROM A WINDOW IN THE DEPOSITORY BUILDING
LJ035-0174 WHERE UPON BARNETT POSTED HIMSELF AT THE FRONT DOOR TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT NO ONE LEFT THE BUILDING
LJ035-0175 THE SERGEANT DID THE SAME THING AT THE REAR OF THE BUILDING
LJ035-0176 BARNETT ESTIMATED THAT APPROXIMATELY 3 MINUTES ELAPSED BETWEEN THE TIME HE HEARD THE LAST OF THE SHOTS AND THE TIME HE STARTED GUARDING THE FRONT DOOR
LJ035-0177 ACCORDING TO BARNETT QUOTE THERE WERE PEOPLE GOING IN AND OUT END QUOTE DURING THIS PERIOD
LJ035-0178 SGT. D. V. HARKNESS OF THE DALLAS POLICE
LJ035-0179 SAID THAT TO HIS KNOWLEDGE THE BUILDING WAS NOT SEALED OFF AT 1236 P.M. WHEN HE CALLED IN ON POLICE RADIO
LJ035-0180 THAT A WITNESS AMOS EUINS HAD SEEN SHOTS FIRED FROM A WINDOW OF THE BUILDING
LJ035-0181 AT THAT TIME INSPECTOR HERBERT V. SAWYER'S CAR WAS PARKED IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING
LJ035-0182 HARKNESS DID NOT KNOW WHETHER OR NOT TWO OFFICERS WITH SAWYER WERE GUARDING THE DOORS
LJ035-0183 AT 1234 P.M. SAWYER HEARD A CALL OVER THE POLICE RADIO THAT THE SHOTS HAD COME FROM THE DEPOSITORY BUILDING
LJ035-0184 HE THEN ENTERED THE BUILDING AND TOOK THE FRONT PASSENGER ELEVATOR AS FAR AS IT WOULD GO  THE FOURTH FLOOR
LJ035-0185 AFTER INSPECTING THIS FLOOR SAWYER RETURNED TO THE STREET ABOUT 3 MINUTES AFTER HE ENTERED THE BUILDING
LJ035-0186 AFTER HE RETURNED TO THE STREET HE DIRECTED SERGEANT HARKNESS TO STATION TWO PATROLMEN AT THE FRONT DOOR AND NOT LET ANYONE IN OR OUT
LJ035-0187 HE ALSO DIRECTED THAT THE BACK DOOR BE SEALED OFF
LJ035-0188 THIS WAS NO EARLIER THAN TWELVE THIRTY SEVEN P.M. AND MAY HAVE BEEN LATER
LJ035-0189 SPECIAL AGENT FORREST V. SORRELS OF THE SECRET SERVICE WHO HAD BEEN IN THE MOTORCADE
LJ035-0190 TESTIFIED THAT AFTER DRIVING TO PARKLAND HOSPITAL HE RETURNED TO THE DEPOSITORY BUILDING ABOUT 20 MINUTES AFTER THE SHOOTING
LJ035-0191 FOUND NO POLICE OFFICERS AT THE REAR DOOR AND WAS ABLE TO ENTER THROUGH THIS DOOR WITHOUT IDENTIFYING HIMSELF
LJ035-0192 ALTHOUGH OSWALD PROBABLY LEFT THE BUILDING AT ABOUT TWELVE THIRTY THREE P.M. HIS ABSENCE WAS NOT NOTICED UNTIL AT LEAST ONEHALF HOUR LATER
LJ035-0193 TRULY WHO HAD RETURNED WITH PATROLMAN BAKER FROM THE ROOF SAW THE POLICE QUESTIONING THE WAREHOUSE EMPLOYEES
LJ035-0194 APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN MEN WORKED IN THE WAREHOUSE AND TRULY NOTICED THAT OSWALD WAS NOT AMONG THOSE BEING QUESTIONED
LJ035-0195 SATISFYING HIMSELF THAT OSWALD WAS MISSING TRULY OBTAINED OSWALD'S ADDRESS PHONE NUMBER AND DESCRIPTION FROM HIS EMPLOYMENT APPLICATION CARD
LJ035-0196 THE ADDRESS LISTED WAS FOR THE PAINE HOME IN IRVING
LJ035-0197 TRULY GAVE THIS INFORMATION TO CAPTAIN FRITZ WHO WAS ON THE SIXTH FLOOR AT THE TIME
LJ035-0198 TRULY ESTIMATED THAT HE GAVE THIS INFORMATION TO FRITZ ABOUT FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MINUTES AFTER THE SHOTS
LJ035-0199 BUT IT WAS PROBABLY NO EARLIER THAN ONE TWENTY TWO P.M. THE TIME WHEN THE RIFLE WAS FOUND
LJ035-0200 FRITZ BELIEVED THAT HE LEARNED OF OSWALD'S ABSENCE AFTER THE RIFLE WAS FOUND
LJ035-0201 THE FACT THAT TRULY FOUND FRITZ IN THE NORTHWEST CORNER OF THE FLOOR NEAR THE POINT WHERE THE RIFLE WAS FOUND SUPPORTS FRITZ' RECOLLECTION
LJ035-0202 FINGERPRINT AND PALMPRINT EVIDENCE ESTABLISHES THAT OSWALD HANDLED TWO OF THE FOUR CARTONS NEXT TO THE WINDOW
LJ035-0203 AND ALSO HANDLED A PAPER BAG WHICH WAS FOUND NEAR THE CARTONS
LJ035-0204 OSWALD WAS SEEN IN THE VICINITY OF THE SOUTHEAST CORNER OF THE SIXTH FLOOR APPROXIMATELY THIRTY THREE MINUTES BEFORE THE ASSASSINATION
LJ035-0205 AND NO ONE COULD BE FOUND WHO SAW OSWALD ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE BUILDING UNTIL AFTER THE SHOOTING
LJ035-0206 AN EYEWITNESS TO THE SHOOTING IMMEDIATELY PROVIDED A DESCRIPTION OF THE MAN IN THE WINDOW WHICH WAS SIMILAR TO OSWALD'S ACTUAL APPEARANCE
LJ035-0207 THIS WITNESS IDENTIFIED OSWALD IN A LINEUP AS THE MAN MOST NEARLY RESEMBLING THE MAN HE SAW AND LATER IDENTIFIED OSWALD AS THE MAN HE OBSERVED
LJ035-0208 OSWALD'S KNOWN ACTIONS IN THE BUILDING IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ASSASSINATION ARE CONSISTENT WITH HIS HAVING BEEN AT THE SOUTHEAST CORNER WINDOW OF THE SIXTH FLOOR
LJ035-0209 AT TWELVE THIRTY P.M.
LJ035-0210 ON THE BASIS OF THESE FINDINGS THE COMMISSION HAS CONCLUDED THAT OSWALD AT THE TIME OF THE ASSASSINATION
LJ036-0001 REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION ON THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY THE WARREN COMMISSION REPORT. BY THE PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION ON THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY
LJ036-0002 CHAPTER FOUR THE ASSASSIN PART FIVE
LJ036-0003 THE KILLING OF PATROLMAN J. D. TIPPIT
LJ036-0004 AFTER LEAVING THE DEPOSITORY BUILDING AT APPROXIMATELY 1233 P.M. LEE HARVEY OSWALD PROCEEDED TO HIS ROOMINGHOUSE BY BUS AND TAXI
LJ036-0005 HE ARRIVED AT APPROXIMATELY ONE P.M. AND LEFT A FEW MINUTES LATER
LJ036-0006 AT ABOUT ONE SIXTEEN P.M. A DALLAS POLICE OFFICER J. D. TIPPIT WAS SHOT LESS THAN ONE MILE FROM OSWALD'S ROOMINGHOUSE
LJ036-0007 IN DECIDING WHETHER OSWALD KILLED PATROLMAN TIPPIT THE COMMISSION CONSIDERED THE FOLLOWING
LJ036-0008 ONE POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION OF THE KILLER BY TWO EYEWITNESSES WHO SAW THE SHOOTING
LJ036-0009 AND SEVEN EYEWITNESSES WHO HEARD THE SHOTS AND SAW THE GUNMAN FLEE THE SCENE WITH THE REVOLVER IN HIS HAND
LJ036-0010 TWOTESTIMONY OF FIREARMS IDENTIFICATION EXPERTS ESTABLISHING THE IDENTITY OF THE MURDER WEAPON
LJ036-0011 THREE EVIDENCE ESTABLISHING THE OWNERSHIP OF THE MURDER WEAPON
LJ036-0012 FOUR EVIDENCE ESTABLISHING THE OWNERSHIP OF A ZIPPER JACKET
LJ036-0013 FOUND ALONG THE PATH OF FLIGHT TAKEN BY THE GUNMAN FROM THE SCENE OF THE SHOOTING TO THE PLACE OF ARREST
LJ036-0014 OSWALD'S MOVEMENTS AFTER LEAVING DEPOSITORY BUILDING
LJ036-0015 ACCORDING TO THE RECONSTRUCTION OF TIME AND EVENTS WHICH THE COMMISSION FOUND MOST CREDIBLE
LJ036-0016 LEE HARVEY OSWALD LEFT THE BUILDING APPROXIMATELY 3 MINUTES AFTER THE ASSASSINATION
LJ036-0017 HE PROBABLY WALKED EAST ON ELM STREET FOR SEVEN BLOCKS TO THE CORNER OF ELM AND MURPHY
LJ036-0018 WHERE HE BOARDED A BUS WHICH WAS HEADING BACK IN THE DIRECTION OF THE DEPOSITORY BUILDING ON ITS WAY TO THE OAK CLIFF SECTION OF DALLAS
LJ036-0019 WHEN OSWALD WAS APPREHENDED A BUS TRANSFER MARKED FOR THE LAKEWOODMARSALIS ROUTE WAS FOUND IN HIS SHIRT POCKET
LJ036-0020 THE TRANSFER WAS DATED FRIDAY NOVEMBER 22 '63 AND WAS PUNCHED IN TWO PLACES BY THE BUS DRIVER
LJ036-0021 ON THE BASIS OF THIS PUNCHMARK WHICH WAS DISTINCTIVE TO EACH DALLAS DRIVER
LJ036-0022 THE TRANSFER WAS CONCLUSIVELY IDENTIFIED AS HAVING BEEN ISSUED BY CECIL J. MCWATTERS A BUSDRIVER FOR THE DALLAS TRANSIT CO
LJ036-0023 ON THE BASIS OF THE DATE AND TIME ON THE TRANSFER MCWATTERS WAS ABLE TO TESTIFY THAT THE TRANSFER HAD BEEN ISSUED BY HIM
LJ036-0024 ON A TRIP WHICH PASSED A CHECK POINT AT ST. PAUL AND ELM STREETS AT TWELVE THIRTY SIX P.M. NOVEMBER 22 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ036-0025 MCWATTERS WAS SURE THAT HE LEFT THE CHECKPOINT ON TIME
LJ036-0026 AND HE ESTIMATED THAT IT TOOK HIM THREE TO FOUR MINUTES TO DRIVE THREE BLOCKS WEST FROM THE CHECKPOINT TO FIELD STREET
LJ036-0027 WHICH HE REACHED AT ABOUT TWELVE FORTY P.M.
LJ036-0028 MCWATTERS' RECOLLECTION IS THAT HE ISSUED THIS TRANSFER TO A MAN WHO ENTERED HIS BUS JUST BEYOND FIELD STREET
LJ036-0029 WHERE A MAN BEAT ON THE FRONT DOOR OF THE BUS BOARDED IT AND PAID HIS FARE
LJ036-0030 ABOUT TWO BLOCKS LATER A WOMAN ASKED TO GET OFF TO MAKE A ONE O'CLOCK TRAIN AT UNION STATION
LJ036-0031 AND REQUESTED A TRANSFER WHICH SHE MIGHT USE IF SHE GOT THROUGH THE TRAFFIC
LJ036-0032 SO I GAVE HER A TRANSFER AND OPENED THE DOOR AND SHE WAS GOING OUT THE GENTLEMAN I HAD PICKED UP ABOUT TWO BLOCKS [BACK]
LJ036-0033 ASKED FOR A TRANSFER AND GOT OFF AT THE SAME PLACE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BLOCK WHERE THE LADY DID
LJ036-0034 IT WAS THE INTERSECTION NEAR LAMAR STREET IT WAS NEAR POYDRAS AND LAMAR STREET
LJ036-0035 THE MAN WAS ON THE BUS APPROXIMATELY 4 MINUTES
LJ036-0036 AT ABOUT SIX THIRTY P.M. ON THE DAY OF THE ASSASSINATION MCWATTERS VIEWED FOUR MEN IN A POLICE LINEUP
LJ036-0037 HE PICKED OSWALD FROM THE LINEUP AS THE MAN WHO HAD BOARDED THE BUS AT THE QUOTE LOWER END OF TOWN ON ELM AROUND HOUSTON END QUOTE
LJ036-0038 AND WHO DURING THE RIDE SOUTH ON MARSALIS HAD AN ARGUMENT WITH A WOMAN PASSENGER
LJ036-0039 IN HIS COMMISSION TESTIMONY MCWATTERS SAID HE HAD BEEN IN ERROR AND THAT A TEENAGER NAMED MILTON JONES WAS THE PASSENGER HE HAD IN MIND
LJ036-0040 IN A LATER INTERVIEW JONES CONFIRMED THAT HE HAD EXCHANGED WORDS WITH A WOMAN PASSENGER ON THE BUS DURING THE RIDE SOUTH ON MARSALIS
LJ036-0041 MCWATTERS ALSO REMEMBERED THAT A MAN RECEIVED A TRANSFER AT LAMAR AND ELM STREETS AND THAT A MAN IN THE LINEUP WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF THIS MAN
LJ036-0042 HOWEVER MCWATTERS' RECOLLECTION ALONE WAS TOO VAGUE TO BE A BASIS FOR PLACING OSWALD ON THE BUS
LJ036-0043 RIDING ON THE BUS WAS AN ELDERLY WOMAN MARY BLEDSOE WHO CONFIRMED THE MUTE EVIDENCE OF THE TRANSFER
LJ036-0044 OSWALD HAD RENTED A ROOM FROM MRS. BLEDSOE ABOUT 6 WEEKS BEFORE ON OCTOBER 7 BUT SHE HAD ASKED HIM TO LEAVE AT THE END OF A WEEK
LJ036-0045 MRS. BLEDSOE TOLD HIM QUOTE I AM NOT GOING TO RENT TO YOU ANY MORE END QUOTE
LJ036-0046 SHE TESTIFIED QUOTE I DIDN'T LIKE HIS ATTITUDE. THERE WAS JUST SOMETHING ABOUT HIM I DIDN'T LIKE OR WANT HIM. JUST DIDN'T WANT HIM AROUND ME END QUOTE
LJ036-0047 ON NOVEMBER 22 MRS. BLEDSOE CAME DOWNTOWN TO WATCH THE PRESIDENTIAL MOTORCADE
LJ036-0048 SHE BOARDED THE MARSALIS BUS AT ST. PAUL AND ELM STREETS TO RETURN HOME. SHE TESTIFIED FURTHER QUOTE
LJ036-0049 AND AFTER WE GOT PAST AKARD AT MURPHY  I FIGURED IT OUT. LET'S SEE. I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE
LJ036-0050 OSWALD GOT ON. HE LOOKS LIKE A MANIAC HIS SLEEVE WAS OUT HERE. HIS SHIRT WAS UNDONE
LJ036-0051 WAS A HOLE IN IT HOLE AND HE WAS DIRTY AND I DIDN'T LOOK AT HIM. I DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW I EVEN SEEN HIM
LJ036-0052 HE LOOKED SO BAD IN HIS FACE AND HIS FACE WAS SO DISTORTED. HOLE IN HIS SLEEVE RIGHT HERE
LJ036-0053 END QUOTE AS MRS. BLEDSOE SAID THESE WORDS SHE POINTED TO HER RIGHT ELBOW
LJ036-0054 WHEN OSWALD WAS ARRESTED IN THE TEXAS THEATRE HE WAS WEARING A BROWN SPORT SHIRT WITH A HOLE IN THE RIGHT SLEEVE AT THE ELBOW
LJ036-0055 MRS. BLEDSOE IDENTIFIED THE SHIRT AS THE ONE OSWALD WAS WEARING AND SHE STATED SHE WAS CERTAIN THAT IT WAS OSWALD WHO BOARDED THE BUS
LJ036-0056 MRS. BLEDSOE RECALLED THAT OSWALD SAT HALFWAY TO THE REAR OF THE BUS WHICH MOVED SLOWLY AND INTERMITTENTLY AS TRAFFIC BECAME HEAVY
LJ036-0057 SHE HEARD A PASSING MOTORIST TELL THE DRIVER THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD BEEN SHOT
LJ036-0058 PEOPLE ON THE BUS BEGAN TALKING ABOUT IT AS THE BUS NEARED LAMAR STREET OSWALD LEFT THE BUS AND DISAPPEARED INTO THE CROWD
LJ036-0059 THE MARSALIS BUS WHICH OSWALD BOARDED TRAVELED A ROUTE WEST ON ELM
LJ036-0060 SOUTH ON HOUSTON AND SOUTHWEST ACROSS THE HOUSTON VIADUCT TO SERVICE THE OAK CLIFF AREA ALONG MARSALIS
LJ036-0061 A BECKLEY BUS WHICH ALSO SERVED THE OAK CLIFF AREA
LJ036-0062 FOLLOWED THE SAME ROUTE AS THE MARSALIS BUS THROUGH DOWNTOWN DALLAS EXCEPT THAT IT CONTINUED WEST ON ELM
LJ036-0063 ACROSS HOUSTON IN FRONT OF THE DEPOSITORY BUILDING PAST THE TRIPLE UNDERPASS INTO WEST DALLAS AND SOUTH ON BECKLEY
LJ036-0064 MARSALIS STREET IS SEVEN BLOCKS FROM BECKLEY
LJ036-0065 OSWALD LIVED AT 1026 NORTH BECKLEY
LJ036-0066 HE COULD NOT REACH HIS ROOMINGHOUSE ON THE MARSALIS BUS BUT THE BECKLEY BUS STOPPED ACROSS THE STREET
LJ036-0067 ACCORDING TO MCWATTERS THE BECKLEY BUS WAS BEHIND THE MARSALIS BUS BUT HE DID NOT ACTUALLY SEE IT
LJ036-0068 BOTH BUSES STOPPED WITHIN ONE BLOCK OF THE DEPOSITORY BUILDING
LJ036-0069 INSTEAD OF WAITING THERE OSWALD APPARENTLY WENT AS FAR AWAY AS HE COULD AND BOARDED THE FIRST OAK CLIFF BUS WHICH CAME ALONG
LJ036-0070 RATHER THAN WAIT FOR ONE WHICH STOPPED ACROSS THE STREET FROM HIS ROOMINGHOUSE
LJ036-0071 IN A RECONSTRUCTION OF THIS BUS TRIP AGENTS OF THE SECRET SERVICE AND THE FBI WALKED THE SEVEN BLOCKS FROM THE FRONT ENTRANCE OF THE DEPOSITORY BUILDING
LJ036-0072 TO MURPHY AND ELM THREE TIMES AVERAGING 6.5 MINUTES FOR THE THREE TRIPS
LJ036-0073 A BUS MOVING THROUGH HEAVY TRAFFIC ON ELM FROM MURPHY TO LAMAR WAS TIMED AT 4 MINUTES
LJ036-0074 IF OSWALD LEFT THE DEPOSITORY BUILDING AT 1233 P.M
LJ036-0075 WALKED SEVEN BLOCKS DIRECTLY TO MURPHY AND ELM AND BOARDED A BUS ALMOST IMMEDIATELY
LJ036-0076 HE WOULD HAVE BOARDED THE BUS AT APPROXIMATELY TWELVE FORTY P.M. AND LEFT IT AT APPROXIMATELY TWELVE FORTY FOUR P.M.
LJ036-0077 ROGER D. CRAIG A DEPUTY SHERIFF OF DALLAS COUNTY
LJ036-0078 CLAIMED THAT ABOUT 15 MINUTES AFTER THE ASSASSINATION HE SAW A MAN WHOM HE LATER IDENTIFIED AS OSWALD
LJ036-0079 COMING FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE DEPOSITORY BUILDING AND RUNNING DOWN THE HILL NORTH OF ELM STREET
LJ036-0080 TOWARD A LIGHTCOLORED RAMBLER STATION WAGON WHICH WAS MOVING SLOWLY ALONG ELM TOWARD THE UNDERPASS
LJ036-0081 THE STATION WAGON STOPPED TO PICK UP THE MAN AND THEN DROVE OFF
LJ036-0082 CRAIG TESTIFIED THAT LATER IN THE AFTERNOON HE SAW OSWALD IN THE POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM
LJ036-0083 AND TOLD CAPTAIN FRITZ THAT OSWALD WAS THE MAN HE SAW
LJ036-0084 CRAIG ALSO CLAIMED THAT WHEN FRITZ POINTED OUT TO OSWALD THAT CRAIG HAD IDENTIFIED HIM
LJ036-0085 OSWALD ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR LOOKED DIRECTLY AT FRITZ AND SAID QUOTE EVERYBODY WILL KNOW WHO I AM NOW END QUOTE
LJ036-0086 THE COMMISSION COULD NOT ACCEPT IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF CRAIG'S TESTIMONY
LJ036-0087 CAPTAIN FRITZ STATED THAT A DEPUTY SHERIFF WHOM HE COULD NOT IDENTIFY DID ASK TO SEE HIM THAT AFTERNOON
LJ036-0088 AND TOLD HIM A SIMILAR STORY TO CRAIG'S
LJ036-0089 FRITZ DID NOT BRING HIM INTO HIS OFFICE TO IDENTIFY OSWALD BUT TURNED HIM OVER TO LIEUTENANT BAKER FOR QUESTIONING
LJ036-0090 IF CRAIG SAW OSWALD THAT AFTERNOON HE SAW HIM THROUGH THE GLASS WINDOWS OF THE OFFICE
LJ036-0091 AND NEITHER CAPTAIN FRITZ NOR ANY OTHER OFFICER CAN REMEMBER THAT OSWALD DRAMATICALLY AROSE FROM HIS CHAIR
LJ036-0092 AND SAID QUOTE EVERYBODY WILL KNOW WHO I AM NOW END QUOTE
LJ036-0093 IF OSWALD HAD MADE SUCH A STATEMENT CAPTAIN FRITZ AND OTHERS PRESENT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE REMEMBERED IT
LJ036-0094 CRAIG MAY HAVE SEEN A PERSON ENTER A WHITE RAMBLER STATION WAGON 15 OR 20 MINUTES AFTER THE SHOOTING AND TRAVEL WEST ON ELM STREET
LJ036-0095 BUT THE COMMISSION CONCLUDED THAT THIS MAN WAS NOT LEE HARVEY OSWALD
LJ036-0096 BECAUSE OF THE OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE THAT OSWALD WAS FAR AWAY FROM THE BUILDING BY THAT TIME
LJ036-0097 THE TAXICAB RIDE
LJ036-0098 WILLIAM WHALEY A TAXICAB DRIVER TOLD HIS EMPLOYER ON SATURDAY MORNING NOVEMBER TWENTY THREE
LJ036-0099 THAT HE RECOGNIZED OSWALD FROM A NEWSPAPER PHOTOGRAPH AS A MAN WHOM HE HAD DRIVEN TO THE OAK CLIFF AREA THE DAY BEFORE
LJ036-0100 NOTIFIED OF WHALEY'S STATEMENT THE POLICE BROUGHT HIM TO THE POLICE STATION THAT AFTERNOON
LJ036-0101 HE WAS TAKEN TO THE LINEUP ROOM WHERE ACCORDING TO WHALEY FIVE YOUNG TEENAGERS ALL HANDCUFFED TOGETHER WERE DISPLAYED WITH OSWALD
LJ036-0102 HE TESTIFIED THAT OSWALD LOOKED OLDER THAN THE OTHER BOYS
LJ036-0103 THE POLICE ASKED HIM WHETHER HE COULD PICK OUT HIS PASSENGER FROM THE LINEUP
LJ036-0104 WHALEY PICKED OSWALD
LJ036-0105 HE SAID QUOTE
LJ036-0106 YOU COULD HAVE PICKED HIM OUT WITHOUT IDENTIFYING HIM BY JUST LISTENING TO HIM
LJ036-0107 BECAUSE HE WAS BAWLING OUT THE POLICEMAN TELLING THEM IT WASN'T RIGHT TO PUT HIM IN LINE WITH THESE TEENAGERS AND ALL OF THAT
LJ036-0108 AND THEY ASKED ME WHICH ONE AND I TOLD THEM. IT WAS HIM ALL RIGHT THE SAME MAN. HE SHOWED NO RESPECT FOR THE POLICEMEN
LJ036-0109 HE TOLD THEM WHAT HE THOUGHT ABOUT THEM THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING AND THEY WERE TRYING TO RAILROAD HIM AND HE WANTED HIS LAWYER
LJ036-0110 WHALEY BELIEVES THAT OSWALD'S CONDUCT DID NOT AID HIM IN HIS IDENTIFICATION QUOTE BECAUSE I KNEW HE WAS THE RIGHT ONE AS SOON AS I SAW HIM
LJ036-0111 WHALEY'S MEMORY OF THE LINEUP IS INACCURATE. THERE WERE FOUR MEN ALTOGETHER NOT SIX MEN IN THE LINEUP WITH OSWALD
LJ036-0112 WHALEY SAID THAT OSWALD WAS THE MAN UNDER NO. 2

LJ036-0124 WHALEY TESTIFIED THAT HE DID NOT KEEP AN ACCURATE TIME RECORD OF HIS TRIPS BUT RECORDED THEM BY THE QUARTER HOUR
LJ036-0125 AND THAT SOMETIMES HE MADE HIS ENTRY RIGHT AFTER A TRIP WHILE AT OTHER TIMES HE WAITED TO RECORD THREE OR FOUR TRIPS
LJ036-0126 AS HE UNLOADED HIS CONTINENTAL BUS STATION PASSENGER IN FRONT OF GREYHOUND HE STARTED TO GET OUT TO BUY A PACKAGE OF CIGARETTES
LJ036-0127 HE SAW A MAN WALKING SOUTH ON LAMAR FROM COMMERCE
LJ036-0128 THE MAN WAS DRESSED IN FADED BLUE COLOR KHAKI WORK CLOTHES A BROWN SHIRT AND SOME KIND OF WORK JACKET THAT ALMOST MATCHED HIS PANTS
LJ036-0129 THE MAN ASKED QUOTE MAY I HAVE THE CAB END QUOTE AND GOT INTO THE FRONT SEAT
LJ036-0130 WHALEY DESCRIBED THE ENSUING EVENTS AS FOLLOWS QUOTE
LJ036-0131 AND ABOUT THAT TIME AN OLD LADY I THINK SHE WAS AN OLD LADY I DON'T REMEMBER NOTHING BUT HER STICKING HER HEAD DOWN PAST HIM IN THE DOOR AND SAID
LJ036-0132 DRIVER WILL YOU CALL ME A CAB DOWN HERE SHE HAD SEEN HIM GET THIS CAB AND SHE WANTED ONE TOO
LJ036-0133 AND HE OPENED THE DOOR A LITTLE BIT LIKE HE WAS GOING TO GET OUT AND HE SAID I WILL LET YOU HAVE THIS ONE AND SHE SAYS NO THE DRIVER CAN CALL ME ONE
LJ036-0134 I ASKED HIM WHERE HE WANTED TO GO. AND HE SAID 500 NORTH BECKLEY. WELL I STARTED UP
LJ036-0135 I STARTED TO THAT ADDRESS AND THE POLICE CARS THE SIRENS WAS GOING RUNNING CRISSCROSSING EVERYWHERE JUST A BIG UPROAR IN THAT END OF TOWN AND I SAID
LJ036-0136 WHAT THE HELL. I WONDER WHAT THE HELL IS THE UPROAR
LJ036-0137 AND HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING. SO I FIGURED HE WAS ONE OF THESE PEOPLE THAT DON'T LIKE TO TALK SO I NEVER SAID ANY MORE TO HIM
LJ036-0138 BUT WHEN I GOT PRETTY CLOSE TO 500 BLOCK AT NECHES AND NORTH BECKLEY WHICH IS THE 500 BLOCK HE SAID THIS WILL DO FINE AND I PULLED OVER TO THE CURB RIGHT THERE
LJ036-0139 HE GAVE ME A DOLLAR BILL THE TRIP WAS 95 CENTS
LJ036-0140 HE GAVE ME A DOLLAR BILL AND DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING JUST GOT OUT AND CLOSED THE DOOR AND WALKED AROUND THE FRONT OF THE CAB OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET
LJ036-0141 [EAST SIDE OF THE STREET]. OF COURSE THE TRAFFIC WAS MOVING THROUGH THERE AND I PUT IT IN GEAR AND MOVED ON THAT IS THE LAST I SAW OF HIM
LJ036-0142 WHALEY WAS SOMEWHAT IMPRECISE AS TO WHERE HE UNLOADED HIS PASSENGER
LJ036-0143 HE MARKED WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS THE INTERSECTION OF NECHES AND BECKLEY ON A MAP OF DALLAS WITH A LARGE X
LJ036-0144 HE SAID QUOTE YES SIR THAT IS RIGHT BECAUSE THAT IS THE 500 BLOCK OF NORTH BECKLEY END QUOTE
LJ036-0145 HOWEVER NECHES AND BECKLEY DO NOT INTERSECT
LJ036-0146 NECHES IS WITHIN ONEHALF BLOCK OF THE ROOMINGHOUSE AT 1026 NORTH BECKLEY WHERE OSWALD WAS LIVING
LJ036-0147 THE 500 BLOCK OF NORTH BECKLEY IS FIVE BLOCKS SOUTH OF THE ROOMINGHOUSE
LJ036-0148 AFTER A REVIEW OF THESE INCONSISTENCIES IN HIS TESTIMONY BEFORE THE COMMISSION WHALEY WAS INTERVIEWED AGAIN IN DALLAS

LJ036-0156 HE WAS IN ERROR HOWEVER
LJ036-0157 OSWALD COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN WEARING THE BLUE JACKET DURING THE TRIP WITH WHALEY SINCE IT WAS FOUND IN THE DOMINO ROOM OF THE DEPOSITORY LATE IN NOVEMBER
LJ036-0158 MOREOVER MRS. BLEDSOE SAW OSWALD IN THE BUS WITHOUT A JACKET AND WEARING A SHIRT WITH A HOLE AT THE ELBOW

LJ036-0166 IS THREE TO FOUR SHORT BLOCKS SOUTH OF LAMAR AND ELM IF OSWALD LEFT THE BUS AT 1244 P.M
LJ036-0167 AND WALKED DIRECTLY TO THE TERMINAL HE WOULD HAVE ENTERED THE CAB AT TWELVE FORTY SEVEN OR 1248 P.M
LJ036-0168 IF THE CAB RIDE WAS APPROXIMATELY SIX MINUTES AS WAS THE RECONSTRUCTED RIDE
LJ036-0169 HE WOULD HAVE REACHED HIS DESTINATION AT APPROXIMATELY 1254 P.M.
LJ036-0170 IF HE WAS DISCHARGED AT NEELY AND BECKLEY AND WALKED DIRECTLY TO HIS ROOMINGHOUSE

LJ037-0073 ADDRESSING ITSELF SOLELY TO THE PROBATIVE VALUE OF MRS. MARKHAM'S CONTEMPORANEOUS DESCRIPTION OF THE GUNMAN
LJ037-0074 AND HER POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION OF OSWALD AT A POLICE LINEUP THE COMMISSION CONSIDERS HER TESTIMONY RELIABLE
LJ037-0075 HOWEVER EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF MRS. MARKHAM'S TESTIMONY THERE IS AMPLE EVIDENCE TO IDENTIFY OSWALD AS THE KILLER OF TIPPIT
LJ037-0076 TWO YOUNG WOMEN

LJ037-0132 NEITHER REYNOLDS NOR PATTERSON SAW THE MAN AFTER HE TURNED OFF JEFFERSON AT THE SERVICE STATION
LJ037-0133 THESE FOUR WITNESSES WERE INTERVIEWED BY FBI AGENTS 2 MONTHS AFTER THE SHOOTING
LJ037-0134 RUSSELL AND PATTERSON WERE SHOWN A PICTURE OF OSWALD AND THEY STATED THAT OSWALD WAS THE MAN THEY SAW ON NOVEMBER 22 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE

LJ037-0140 L.J. LEWIS SAID IN AN INTERVIEW THAT BECAUSE OF THE DISTANCE FROM WHICH HE OBSERVED THE GUNMAN HE WOULD HESITATE TO STATE WHETHER THE MAN WAS IDENTICAL WITH OSWALD
LJ037-0141 WHEN OSWALD WAS ARRESTED HE HAD IN HIS POSSESSION A SMITH & WESSON 38 SPECIAL CALIBER REVOLVER
LJ037-0142 SERIAL NUMBER V510210
LJ037-0143 TWO OF THE ARRESTING OFFICERS PLACED THEIR INITIALS ON THE WEAPON AND A THIRD INSCRIBED HIS NAME
LJ037-0144 ALL THREE IDENTIFIED EXHIBIT NO. 143 AS THE REVOLVER TAKEN FROM OSWALD WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED
LJ037-0145 FOUR CARTRIDGE CASES WERE FOUND IN THE SHRUBBERY ON THE CORNER OF 10TH AND PATTON BY THREE OF THE EYEWITNESSES  DOMINGO BENAVIDES
LJ037-0146 BARBARA JEANETTE DAVIS AND VIRGINIA DAVIS
LJ037-0147 IT WAS THE UNANIMOUS AND UNEQUIVOCAL TESTIMONY OF EXPERT WITNESSES BEFORE THE COMMISSION THAT THESE USED CARTRIDGE CASES WERE FIRED FROM THE REVOLVER
LJ037-0148 IN OSWALD'S POSSESSION TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL OTHER WEAPONS
LJ037-0149 CORTLANDT CUNNINGHAM OF THE FIREARMS IDENTIFICATION UNIT OF THE FBI LABORATORY TESTIFIED
LJ037-0150 THAT HE COMPARED THE FOUR EMPTY CARTRIDGE CASES FOUND NEAR THE SCENE OF THE SHOOTING WITH A TEST CARTRIDGE FIRED FROM THE WEAPON IN OSWALD'S POSSESSION WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED
LJ037-0151 CUNNINGHAM DECLARED THAT THIS WEAPON FIRED THE FOUR CARTRIDGES TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL OTHER WEAPONS
LJ037-0152 IDENTIFICATION WAS EFFECTED THROUGH BREECH FACE MARKS AND FIRING PIN MARKS
LJ037-0153 ROBERT A. FRAZIER AND CHARLES KILLION OTHER FBI FIREARMS EXPERTS
LJ037-0154 INDEPENDENTLY EXAMINED THE FOUR CARTRIDGE CASES AND ARRIVED AT THE SAME CONCLUSION AS CUNNINGHAM
LJ037-0155 AT THE REQUEST OF THE COMMISSION JOSEPH D. NICOL SUPERINTENDENT OF THE ILLINOIS BUREAU OF CRIMINAL IDENTIFICATION INVESTIGATION
LJ037-0156 ALSO EXAMINED THE FOUR CARTRIDGE CASES FOUND NEAR THE SITE OF THE HOMICIDE AND COMPARED THEM WITH THE TEST CARTRIDGE CASES FIRED FROM THE SMITH & WESSON REVOLVER
LJ037-0157 TAKEN FROM OSWALD
LJ037-0158 HE CONCLUDED THAT ALL OF THESE CARTRIDGES WERE FIRED FROM THE SAME WEAPON
LJ037-0159 CUNNINGHAM COMPARED FOUR LEAD BULLETS RECOVERED FROM THE BODY OF PATROLMAN TIPPIT WITH TEST BULLETS FIRED FROM OSWALD'S REVOLVER
LJ037-0160 HE EXPLAINED THAT THE BULLETS WERE SLIGHTLY SMALLER THAN THE BARREL OF THE PISTOL WHICH HAD FIRED THEM. THIS CAUSED THE BULLETS TO HAVE AN ERRATIC PASSAGE THROUGH THE BARREL
LJ037-0161 AND IMPRESSED UPON THE LEAD OF THE BULLETS INCONSISTENT INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS WHICH MADE IDENTIFICATION IMPOSSIBLE
LJ037-0162 CONSECUTIVE BULLETS FIRED FROM THE REVOLVER BY THE FBI EXPERTS COULD NOT BE IDENTIFIED AS HAVING BEEN FIRED FROM THAT REVOLVER
LJ037-0163 CUNNINGHAM TESTIFIED THAT ALL OF THE BULLETS WERE MUTILATED ONE BEING USELESS FOR COMPARISON PURPOSES
LJ037-0164 ALL FOUR BULLETS WERE FIRED FROM A WEAPON
LJ037-0165 WITH FIVE LANDS AND GROOVES AND A RIGHT TWIST WHICH WERE THE RIFLING CHARACTERISTICS OF THE REVOLVER TAKEN FROM OSWALD
LJ037-0166 HE CONCLUDED HOWEVER THAT HE COULD NOT SAY WHETHER THE FOUR BULLETS WERE FIRED FROM THE REVOLVER IN OSWALD'S POSSESSION
LJ037-0167 QUOTE THE ONLY THING I CAN TESTIFY IS THEY COULD HAVE ON THE BASIS OF THE RIFLING CHARACTERISTICS  THEY COULD HAVE BEEN END QUOTE
LJ037-0168 NICOL DIFFERED WITH THE FBI EXPERTS ON ONE BULLET TAKEN FROM TIPPIT'S BODY
LJ037-0169 HE DECLARED THAT THIS BULLET WAS FIRED FROM THE SAME WEAPON THAT FIRED THE TEST BULLETS TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL OTHER WEAPONS
LJ037-0170 BUT HE AGREED THAT BECAUSE THE OTHER THREE BULLETS WERE MUTILATED HE COULD NOT DETERMINE IF THEY HAD BEEN FIRED FROM THE SAME WEAPON AS THE TEST BULLETS
LJ037-0171 THE EXAMINATION AND TESTIMONY OF THE EXPERTS ENABLED THE COMMISSION TO CONCLUDE THAT FIVE SHOTS MAY HAVE BEEN FIRED
LJ037-0172 EVEN THOUGH ONLY FOUR BULLETS WERE RECOVERED
LJ037-0173 THREE OF THE BULLETS RECOVERED FROM TIPPIT'S BODY WERE MANUFACTURED BY WINCHESTERWESTERN AND THE FOURTH BULLET BY REMINGTONPETERS
LJ037-0174 BUT ONLY TWO OF THE FOUR DISCARDED CARTRIDGE CASES FOUND ON THE LAWN AT 10TH STREET AND PATTON AVENUE WERE OF WINCHESTERWESTERN MANUFACTURE
LJ037-0175 THEREFORE ONE CARTRIDGE CASE OF THIS TYPE WAS NOT RECOVERED
LJ037-0176 AND THOUGH ONLY ONE BULLET OF REMINGTONPETERS MANUFACTURE WAS RECOVERED TWO EMPTY CARTRIDGE CASES OF THAT MAKE WERE RETRIEVED
LJ037-0177 THEREFORE EITHER ONE BULLET OF REMINGTONPETERS MANUFACTURE IS MISSING
LJ037-0178 OR ONE USED REMINGTONPETERS CARTRIDGE CASE WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN IN THE REVOLVER BEFORE THE SHOOTING
LJ037-0179 WAS DISCARDED ALONG WITH THE OTHERS AS OSWALD LEFT THE SCENE
LJ037-0180 IF A BULLET IS MISSING FIVE WERE FIRED. THIS CORRESPONDS WITH THE OBSERVATION AND MEMORY OF TED CALLAWAY AND POSSIBLY WARREN REYNOLDS
LJ037-0181 BUT NOT WITH THE OTHER EYEWITNESSES WHO CLAIM TO HAVE HEARD FROM TWO TO FOUR SHOTS
LJ037-0182 OWNERSHIP OF REVOLVER

LJ038-0206 WHEN HE FAILED TO RETURN BY 10 OR 1030 P.M. MARINA OSWALD WENT TO HIS ROOM AND DISCOVERED THE NOTE. SHE TESTIFIED QUOTE
LJ038-0207 WHEN HE CAME BACK I ASKED HIM WHAT HAD HAPPENED. HE WAS VERY PALE
LJ038-0208 I DON'T REMEMBER THE EXACT TIME BUT IT WAS VERY LATE. AND HE TOLD ME NOT TO ASK HIM ANY QUESTIONS. HE ONLY TOLD ME HE HAD SHOT AT GENERAL WALKER
LJ038-0209 OSWALD TOLD HIS WIFE THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER HE HAD HIT WALKER
LJ038-0210 ACCORDING TO MARINA OSWALD WHEN HE LEARNED ON THE RADIO AND IN THE NEWSPAPERS THE NEXT DAY THAT HE HAD MISSED
LJ038-0211 HE SAID THAT HE QUOTE WAS VERY SORRY THAT HE HAD NOT HIT HIM END QUOTE MARINA OSWALD'S TESTIMONY WAS FULLY SUPPORTED BY THE NOTE ITSELF
LJ038-0212 WHICH APPEARED TO BE THE WORK OF A MAN EXPECTING TO BE KILLED OR IMPRISONED OR TO DISAPPEAR
LJ038-0213 THE LAST PARAGRAPH DIRECTED HER TO THE JAIL
LJ038-0214 AND THE OTHER PARAGRAPHS INSTRUCTED HER ON THE DISPOSAL OF OSWALD'S PERSONAL EFFECTS AND THE MANAGEMENT OF HER AFFAIRS IF HE SHOULD NOT RETURN
LJ038-0215 IT IS CLEAR THAT THE NOTE WAS WRITTEN WHILE THE OSWALDS WERE LIVING IN DALLAS BEFORE THEY MOVED TO NEW ORLEANS IN THE SPRING OF NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ038-0216 THE REFERENCES TO HOUSE RENT AND PAYMENTS FOR WATER AND GAS
LJ038-0217 INDICATED THAT THE NOTE WAS WRITTEN WHEN THEY WERE LIVING IN A RENTED APARTMENT THEREFORE IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN WHILE MARINA OSWALD WAS LIVING WITH THE PAINES
LJ038-0218 MOREOVER THE REFERENCE IN PARAGRAPH THREE TO PAYING QUOTE THE HOUSE RENT ON THE 2ND END QUOTE

LJ038-0224 ANOTHER STATEMENT WHICH LIMITS THE TIME WHEN IT COULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN IS THE REFERENCE QUOTE YOU AND THE BABY END QUOTE
LJ038-0225 WHICH WOULD INDICATE THAT IT WAS PROBABLY WRITTEN BEFORE THE BIRTH OF OSWALD'S SECOND CHILD ON OCTOBER 20 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ038-0226 OSWALD HAD APPARENTLY MISTAKEN THE COUNTY JAIL FOR THE CITY JAIL
LJ038-0227 FROM NEELY STREET THE OSWALDS WOULD HAVE TRAVELED DOWNTOWN ON THE BECKLEY BUS ACROSS THE COMMERCE STREET VIADUCT
LJ038-0228 AND INTO DOWNTOWN DALLAS THROUGH THE TRIPLE UNDERPASS
LJ038-0229 EITHER THE VIADUCT OR THE UNDERPASS MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE BRIDGE MENTIONED IN THE LAST PARAGRAPH OF THE NOTE
LJ038-0230 THE COUNTY JAIL IS AT THE CORNER OF HOUSTON AND MAIN STREETS QUOTE RIGHT IN THE BEGINNING OF THE CITY END QUOTE AFTER ONE TRAVELS THROUGH THE UNDERPASS
LJ038-0231 IN HER TESTIMONY BEFORE THE COMMISSION IN FEBRUARY NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR

LJ038-0233 HE SHOWED HER A NOTEBOOK 3 DAYS LATER CONTAINING PHOTOGRAPHS OF GENERAL WALKER'S HOME AND A MAP OF THE AREA WHERE THE HOUSE WAS LOCATED
LJ038-0234 ALTHOUGH OSWALD DESTROYED THE NOTEBOOK THREE PHOTOGRAPHS FOUND AMONG OSWALD'S POSSESSIONS AFTER THE ASSASSINATION
LJ038-0235 WERE IDENTIFIED BY MARINA OSWALD AS PHOTOGRAPHS OF GENERAL WALKER'S HOUSE
LJ038-0236 TWO OF THESE PHOTOGRAPHS WERE TAKEN FROM THE REAR OF WALKER'S HOUSE
LJ038-0237 THE COMMISSION CONFIRMED BY COMPARISON WITH OTHER PHOTOGRAPHS THAT THESE WERE INDEED PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE REAR OF WALKER'S HOUSE
LJ038-0238 AN EXAMINATION OF THE WINDOW AT THE REAR OF THE HOUSE THE WALL THROUGH WHICH THE BULLET PASSED AND THE FENCE BEHIND THE HOUSE
LJ038-0239 INDICATED THAT THE BULLET WAS FIRED FROM A POSITION NEAR THE POINT WHERE ONE OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS WAS TAKEN
LJ038-0240 THE THIRD PHOTOGRAPH IDENTIFIED BY MARINA OSWALD DEPICTS THE ENTRANCE TO GENERAL WALKER'S DRIVEWAY FROM A BACK ALLEY
LJ038-0241 ALSO SEEN IN THE PICTURE IS THE FENCE ON WHICH WALKER'S ASSAILANT APPARENTLY RESTED THE RIFLE
LJ038-0242 AN EXAMINATION OF CERTAIN CONSTRUCTION WORK APPEARING IN THE BACKGROUND OF THIS PHOTOGRAPH REVEALED THAT THE PICTURE WAS TAKEN BETWEEN MARCH 8
LJ038-0243 AND 12 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE AND MOST PROBABLY ON EITHER MARCH 9 OR MARCH 10
LJ038-0244 OSWALD PURCHASED THE MONEY ORDER FOR THE RIFLE ON MARCH TWELVE THE RIFLE WAS SHIPPED ON MARCH 20 AND THE SHOOTING OCCURRED ON APRIL 10
LJ038-0245 A PHOTOGRAPHY EXPERT WITH THE FBI
LJ038-0246 WAS ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT THIS PICTURE WAS TAKEN WITH THE IMPERIAL REFLEX CAMERA OWNED BY LEE HARVEY OSWALD
LJ038-0247 A FOURTH PHOTOGRAPH SHOWING A STRETCH OF RAILROAD TRACKS
LJ038-0248 WAS ALSO IDENTIFIED BY MARINA OSWALD AS HAVING BEEN TAKEN BY HER HUSBAND PRESUMABLY IN CONNECTION WITH THE WALKER SHOOTING
LJ038-0249 INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT THIS PHOTOGRAPH WAS TAKEN APPROXIMATELY SEVENTENTHS OF A MILE FROM WALKER'S HOUSE
LJ038-0250 ANOTHER PHOTOGRAPH OF RAILROAD TRACKS FOUND AMONG OSWALD'S POSSESSIONS WAS NOT IDENTIFIED BY HIS WIFE
LJ038-0251 BUT INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT IT WAS TAKEN FROM A POINT SLIGHTLY LESS THAN HALF A MILE FROM GENERAL WALKER'S HOUSE
LJ038-0252 MARINA OSWALD STATED THAT WHEN SHE ASKED HER HUSBAND WHAT BE HAD DONE WITH THE RIFLE
LJ038-0253 HE REPLIED THAT HE HAD BURIED IT IN THE GROUND OR HIDDEN IT IN SOME BUSHES AND THAT HE ALSO MENTIONED A RAILROAD TRACK IN THIS CONNECTION
LJ038-0254 SHE TESTIFIED THAT SEVERAL DAYS LATER OSWALD RECOVERED HIS RIFLE AND BROUGHT IT BACK TO THEIR APARTMENT
LJ038-0255 FIREARMS IDENTIFICATION
LJ038-0256 IN THE ROOM BEYOND THE ONE IN WHICH GENERAL WALKER WAS SITTING ON THE NIGHT OF THE SHOOTING THE DALLAS POLICE RECOVERED A BADLY MUTILATED BULLET
LJ038-0257 WHICH HAD COME TO REST ON A STACK OF PAPER
LJ038-0258 THE DALLAS CITYCOUNTY INVESTIGATION LABORATORY TRIED TO DETERMINE THE TYPE OF WEAPON WHICH FIRED THE BULLET
LJ038-0259 THE ORAL REPORT WAS NEGATIVE BECAUSE OF THE BATTERED CONDITION OF THE BULLET
LJ038-0260 ON NOVEMBER 30 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE THE FBI REQUESTED THE BULLET FOR BALLISTICS EXAMINATION
LJ038-0261 THE DALLAS POLICE DEPARTMENT FORWARDED IT ON DECEMBER 2 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ038-0262 ROBERT A. FRAZIER AN FBI BALLISTICS IDENTIFICATION EXPERT TESTIFIED THAT HE WAS QUOTE UNABLE TO REACH A CONCLUSION END QUOTE
LJ038-0263 AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THE BULLET RECOVERED FROM WALKER'S HOUSE HAD BEEN FIRED FROM THE RIFLE FOUND ON THE SIXTH FLOOR OF THE TEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY BUILDING
LJ038-0264 HE CONCLUDED THAT QUOTE THE GENERAL RIFLING CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RIFLE ARE OF THE SAME TYPE AS THOSE FOUND ON THE BULLET
LJ038-0265 AND FURTHER ON THIS BASIS THE BULLET COULD HAVE BEEN FIRED FROM THE RIFLE ON THE BASIS OF ITS LAND AND GROOVE IMPRESSIONS END QUOTE
LJ038-0266 FRAZIER TESTIFIED FURTHER THAT THE FBI AVOIDS THE CATEGORY OF PROBABLE IDENTIFICATION
LJ038-0267 UNLESS THE MISSILE OR CARTRIDGE CASE CAN BE IDENTIFIED AS COMING FROM A PARTICULAR WEAPON TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL OTHERS
LJ038-0268 THE FBI REFUSES TO DRAW ANY CONCLUSION AS TO PROBABILITY
LJ038-0269 FRAZIER TESTIFIED HOWEVER THAT HE FOUND NO MICROSCOPIC CHARACTERISTICS OR OTHER EVIDENCE
LJ038-0270 WHICH WOULD INDICATE THAT THE BULLET WAS NOT FIRED FROM THE MANNLICHERCARCANO RIFLE OWNED BY LEE HARVEY OSWALD
LJ038-0271 IT WAS A 6.5 MILLIMETER BULLET
LJ038-0272 AND ACCORDING TO FRAZIER RELATIVELY FEW TYPES OF RIFLES COULD PRODUCE THE CHARACTERISTICS FOUND ON THE BULLET
LJ038-0273 JOSEPH D. NICOL
LJ038-0274 SUPERINTENDENT OF THE ILLINOIS BUREAU OF CRIMINAL IDENTIFICATION AND INVESTIGATION CONDUCTED AN INDEPENDENT EXAMINATION OF THIS BULLET
LJ038-0275 AND CONCLUDED QUOTE THAT THERE IS A FAIR PROBABILITY END QUOTE THAT THE BULLET WAS FIRED FROM THE RIFLE USED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY
LJ038-0276 IN EXPLAINING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIS POLICY AND THAT OF THE FBI ON THE MATTER OF PROBABLE IDENTIFICATION NICOL SAID QUOTE
LJ038-0277 I AM AWARE OF THEIR POSITION. THIS IS NOT I AM SURE ARRIVED AT WITHOUT CAREFUL CONSIDERATION
LJ038-0278 HOWEVER TO SAY THAT BECAUSE ONE DOES NOT FIND SUFFICIENT MARKS FOR IDENTIFICATION THAT IT IS A NEGATIVE
LJ038-0279 I THINK IS GOING OVERBOARD IN THE OTHER DIRECTION
LJ038-0280 AND FOR PURPOSES OF PROBATIVE VALUE FOR WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE WORTH
LJ038-0281 IN THE ABSENCE OF VERY DEFINITE NEGATIVE EVIDENCE I THINK IT IS PERMISSIBLE TO SAY THAT IN AN EXHIBIT SUCH AS 573
LJ038-0282 THERE IS ENOUGH ON IT TO SAY THAT IT COULD HAVE COME AND EVEN PERHAPS A LITTLE STRONGER TO SAY THAT IT PROBABLY CAME FROM THIS
LJ038-0283 WITHOUT GOING SO FAR AS TO SAY TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL OTHER GUNS. THIS I COULD NOT DO END QUOTE
LJ038-0284 ALTHOUGH THE COMMISSION RECOGNIZES THAT NEITHER EXPERT WAS ABLE TO STATE
LJ038-0285 THAT THE BULLET WHICH MISSED GENERAL WALKER WAS FIRED FROM OSWALD'S RIFLE TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL OTHERS THIS TESTIMONY WAS CONSIDERED PROBATIVE
LJ038-0286 WHEN COMBINED WITH THE OTHER TESTIMONY LINKING OSWALD TO THE SHOOTING
LJ038-0287 ADDITIONAL CORROBORATIVE EVIDENCE
LJ038-0288 THE ADMISSIONS MADE TO MARINA OSWALD BY HER HUSBAND ARE AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT IN THE EVIDENCE THAT LEE HARVEY OSWALD FIRED THE SHOT AT GENERAL WALKER
LJ038-0289 AS SHOWN ABOVE THE NOTE AND THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF WALKER'S HOUSE AND OF THE NEARBY RAILROAD TRACKS
LJ038-0290 PROVIDE IMPORTANT CORROBORATION FOR HER ACCOUNT OF THE INCIDENT
LJ038-0291 OTHER DETAILS DESCRIBED BY MARINA OSWALD COINCIDE WITH FACTS DEVELOPED INDEPENDENTLY OF HER STATEMENTS
LJ038-0292 SHE TESTIFIED THAT HER HUSBAND HAD POSTPONED HIS ATTEMPT TO KILL WALKER
LJ038-0293 UNTIL THAT WEDNESDAY BECAUSE HE HAD HEARD THAT THERE WAS TO BE A GATHERING AT THE CHURCH NEXT DOOR TO WALKER'S HOUSE ON THAT EVENING
LJ038-0294 HE INDICATED THAT HE WANTED MORE PEOPLE IN THE VICINITY AT THE TIME OF THE ATTEMPT SO THAT HIS ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE WOULD NOT ATTRACT GREAT ATTENTION
LJ038-0295 AN OFFICIAL OF THIS CHURCH TOLD FBI AGENTS THAT SERVICES ARE HELD EVERY WEDNESDAY AT THE CHURCH EXCEPT DURING THE MONTH OF AUGUST
LJ038-0296 MARINA OSWALD ALSO TESTIFIED THAT HER HUSBAND HAD USED A BUS TO RETURN HOME
LJ038-0297 A STUDY OF THE BUS ROUTES INDICATES THAT
LJ038-0298 OSWALD COULD HAVE TAKEN ANY ONE OF SEVERAL DIFFERENT BUSES TO WALKER'S HOUSE OR TO A POINT NEAR THE RAILROAD TRACKS WHERE HE MAY HAVE CONCEALED THE RIFLE
LJ038-0299 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO TAKE DIFFERENT ROUTES IN APPROACHING AND LEAVING THE SCENE OF THE SHOOTING
LJ038-0300 BASED ON ONE THE CONTENTS OF THE NOTE WHICH OSWALD LEFT FOR HIS WIFE ON APRIL 10 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ038-0301 TWO THE PHOTOGRAPHS FOUND AMONG OSWALD'S POSSESSIONS
LJ038-0302 THREE THE TESTIMONY OF FIREARMS IDENTIFICATION EXPERTS AND FOUR THE TESTIMONY OF MARINA OSWALD
LJ038-0303 THE COMMISSION HAS CONCLUDED THAT LEE HARVEY OSWALD ATTEMPTED TO TAKE THE LIFE OF MAJ. GEN. EDWIN A. WALKER RESIGNED U.S. ARMY
LJ038-0304 ON APRIL TEN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ038-0305 THE FINDING THAT LEE HARVEY OSWALD ATTEMPTED TO MURDER A PUBLIC FIGURE IN APRIL NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ038-0306 WAS CONSIDERED OF PROBATIVE VALUE IN THIS INVESTIGATION ALTHOUGH THE COMMISSION'S CONCLUSION CONCERNING THE IDENTITY OF THE ASSASSIN

LJ039-0016 HE FINISHED READING A MORNING NEWSPAPER QUOTE AND PUT ON A GOOD SUIT. I SAW THAT HE TOOK A PISTOL
LJ039-0017 I ASKED HIM WHERE HE WAS GOING AND WHY HE WAS GETTING DRESSED. HE ANSWERED NIXON IS COMING. I WANT TO GO AND HAVE A LOOK END QUOTE
LJ039-0018 HE ALSO SAID THAT HE WOULD USE THE PISTOL IF THE OPPORTUNITY AROSE
LJ039-0019 SHE REMINDED HIM THAT AFTER THE WALKER SHOOTING HE HAD PROMISED NEVER TO REPEAT SUCH AN ACT
LJ039-0020 MARINA OSWALD RELATED THE EVENTS WHICH FOLLOWED QUOTE
LJ039-0021 I CALLED HIM INTO THE BATHROOM AND I CLOSED THE DOOR AND I WANTED TO PREVENT HIM AND THEN I STARTED TO CRY
LJ039-0022 AND I TOLD HIM THAT HE SHOULDN'T DO THIS AND THAT HE HAD PROMISED ME
LJ039-0023 I REMEMBER THAT I HELD HIM. WE ACTUALLY STRUGGLED FOR SEVERAL MINUTES AND THEN HE QUIETED DOWN. END QUOTE
LJ039-0024 SHE STATED THAT IT WAS NOT PHYSICAL FORCE WHICH KEPT HIM FROM LEAVING THE HOUSE. QUOTE I COULDN'T KEEP HIM FROM GOING OUT IF HE REALLY WANTED TO END QUOTE
LJ039-0025 AFTER FURTHER QUESTIONING
LJ039-0026 SHE STATED THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONFUSED ABOUT SHUTTING HIM IN THE BATHROOM BUT THAT QUOTE THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT HE GOT DRESSED AND GOT A GUN END QUOTE
LJ039-0027 OSWALD'S REVOLVER
LJ039-0028 WAS SHIPPED FROM LOS ANGELES ON MARCH 20 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE AND HE LEFT FOR NEW ORLEANS ON APRIL 24 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ039-0029 NO EDITION OF EITHER DALLAS NEWSPAPER DURING THE PERIOD JANUARY 1 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE TO MAY 15 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ039-0030 MENTIONED ANY PROPOSED VISIT BY MR. NIXON TO DALLAS
LJ039-0031 MR. NIXON ADVISED THE COMMISSION THAT THE ONLY TIME HE WAS IN DALLAS IN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ039-0032 WAS ON NOVEMBER 20 TO 21 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ039-0033 AN INVESTIGATION FAILED TO REVEAL ANY INVITATION EXTENDED TO MR. NIXON DURING THE PERIOD WHEN OSWALD'S THREAT REPORTEDLY OCCURRED
LJ039-0034 THE COMMISSION HAS CONCLUDED THEREFORE THAT REGARDLESS OF WHAT OSWALD MAY HAVE SAID TO HIS WIFE
LJ039-0035 HE WAS NOT ACTUALLY PLANNING TO SHOOT MR. NIXON AT THAT TIME IN DALLAS
LJ039-0036 ON APRIL 23 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ039-0037 VICE PRESIDENT LYNDON B. JOHNSON WAS IN DALLAS FOR A VISIT WHICH HAD BEEN PUBLICIZED IN THE DALLAS NEWSPAPERS
LJ039-0038 THROUGHOUT APRIL. THE COMMISSION ASKED MARINA OSWALD WHETHER SHE MIGHT HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD THE OBJECT OF HER HUSBAND'S THREAT. SHE STATED QUOTE
LJ039-0039 THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT IN THIS INCIDENT IT WAS A QUESTION OF MR. NIXON END QUOTE
LJ039-0040 WHEN ASKED LATER WHETHER IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MR. JOHNSON SHE SAID QUOTE YES NO
LJ039-0041 I AM GETTING A LITTLE CONFUSED WITH SO MANY QUESTIONS
LJ039-0042 I WAS ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED IT WAS NIXON AND NOW AFTER ALL THESE QUESTIONS I WONDER IF I AM RIGHT IN MY MIND END QUOTE
LJ039-0043 SHE STATED FURTHER THAT OSWALD HAD ONLY MENTIONED NIXON'S NAME ONCE DURING THE INCIDENT MARINA OSWALD MIGHT HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD HER HUSBAND
LJ039-0044 MR. JOHNSON WAS THE THEN VICE PRESIDENT AND HIS VISIT TOOK PLACE ON APRIL 23RD
LJ039-0045 THIS WAS 1 DAY BEFORE OSWALD LEFT FOR NEW ORLEANS AND MARINA APPEARED CERTAIN THAT THE NIXON INCIDENT QUOTE
LJ039-0046 WASN'T THE DAY BEFORE PERHAPS THREE DAYS BEFORE END QUOTE
LJ039-0047 MARINA OSWALD SPECULATED THAT THE INCIDENT MAY HAVE BEEN UNRELATED TO AN ACTUAL THREAT
LJ039-0048 SHE SAID QUOTE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THAT HE WAS JUST TRYING TO TEST ME
LJ039-0049 HE WAS THE KIND OF PERSON WHO COULD TRY AND WOUND SOMEBODY IN THAT WAY. POSSIBLY HE DIDN'T WANT TO GO OUT AT ALL BUT WAS JUST DOING THIS ALL AS A SORT OF JOKE
LJ039-0050 NOT REALLY AS A JOKE BUT RATHER TO SIMPLY WOUND ME TO MAKE ME FEEL BAD END QUOTE
LJ039-0051 IN THE ABSENCE OF OTHER EVIDENCE THAT OSWALD ACTUALLY INTENDED TO SHOOT SOMEONE AT THIS TIME
LJ039-0052 THE COMMISSION CONCLUDED THAT THE INCIDENT AS DESCRIBED BY MARINA OSWALD
LJ039-0053 WAS OF NO PROBATIVE VALUE IN THE COMMISSION'S DECISION CONCERNING THE IDENTITY OF THE ASSASSIN OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY
LJ039-0054 OSWALD'S RIFLE CAPABILITY
LJ039-0055 IN DECIDING WHETHER LEE HARVEY OSWALD FIRED THE SHOTS WHICH KILLED PRESIDENT KENNEDY AND WOUNDED GOVERNOR CONNALLY
LJ039-0056 THE COMMISSION CONSIDERED WHETHER OSWALD USING HIS OWN RIFLE
LJ039-0057 POSSESSED THE CAPABILITY TO HIT HIS TARGET WITH TWO OUT OF THREE SHOTS UNDER THE CONDITIONS DESCRIBED IN CHAPTER 3
LJ039-0058 THE COMMISSION EVALUATED ONE THE NATURE OF THE SHOTS TWO OSWALD'S MARINE TRAINING IN MARKSMANSHIP
LJ039-0059 3 HIS EXPERIENCE AND PRACTICE AFTER LEAVING THE MARINE CORPS AND 4 THE ACCURACY OF THE WEAPON AND THE QUALITY OF THE AMMUNITION
LJ039-0060 THE NATURE OF THE SHOTS
LJ039-0061 FOR A RIFLEMAN SITUATED ON THE SIXTH FLOOR OF THE TEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY BUILDING
LJ039-0062 THE SHOTS WERE AT A SLOWMOVING TARGET PROCEEDING ON A DOWNGRADE IN VIRTUALLY A STRAIGHT LINE
LJ039-0063 WITH THE ALINEMENT OF THE ASSASSIN'S RIFLE AT A RANGE OF 177 TO 266 FEET
LJ039-0064 AN AERIAL PHOTOGRAPH OF DEALEY PLAZA SHOWS THAT ELM STREET RUNS AT AN ANGLE
LJ039-0065 SO THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE BEEN MOVING IN AN ALMOST STRAIGHT LINE AWAY FROM THE ASSASSIN'S RIFLE
LJ039-0066 IN ADDITION THE 3 DEGREE DOWNWARD SLOPE OF ELM STREET WAS OF ASSISTANCE IN ELIMINATING AT LEAST SOME OF THE ADJUSTMENT
LJ039-0067 WHICH IS ORDINARILY REQUIRED WHEN A MARKSMAN MUST RAISE HIS RIFLE AS A TARGET MOVES FARTHER AWAY
LJ039-0068 FOUR MARKSMANSHIP EXPERTS TESTIFIED BEFORE THE COMMISSION
LJ039-0069 MAJ. EUGENE D. ANDERSON ASSISTANT HEAD OF THE MARKSMANSHIP BRANCH OF U.S. MARINE CORPS
LJ039-0070 TESTIFIED THAT THE SHOTS WHICH STRUCK THE PRESIDENT IN THE NECK AND IN THE HEAD WERE QUOTE NOT PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT END QUOTE
LJ039-0071 ROBERT A. FRAZIER FBI EXPERT IN FIREARMS IDENTIFICATION AND TRAINING SAID QUOTE
LJ039-0072 FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE IN SHOOTING OVER THE YEARS
LJ039-0073 WHEN YOU SHOOT AT 175 FEET OR 260 FEET WHICH IS LESS THAN A HUNDRED YARDS WITH A TELESCOPIC SIGHT
LJ039-0074 YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY DIFFICULTY IN HITTING YOUR TARGET. I MEAN IT REQUIRES NO TRAINING AT ALL TO SHOOT A WEAPON WITH A TELESCOPIC SIGHT
LJ039-0075 ONCE YOU KNOW THAT YOU MUST PUT THE CROSSHAIRS ON THE TARGET AND THAT IS ALL THAT IS NECESSARY
LJ039-0076 RONALD SIMMONS CHIEF OF THE U.S. ARMY INFANTRY WEAPONS EVALUATION BRANCH OF THE BALLISTICS RESEARCH LABORATORY SAID QUOTE
LJ039-0077 WELL IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THREE HITS IT WOULD NOT BE REQUIRED THAT A MAN BE AN EXCEPTIONAL SHOT. A PROFICIENT MAN WITH THIS WEAPON YES END QUOTE
LJ039-0078 THE EFFECT OF A FOURPOWER TELESCOPIC SIGHT ON THE DIFFICULTY OF THESE SHOTS WAS CONSIDERED IN DETAIL
LJ039-0079 BY MASTER SGT. JAMES A. ZAHM NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER IN CHARGE OF THE MARKSMANSHIP TRAINING UNIT IN THE WEAPONS TRAINING BATTALION
LJ039-0080 OF THE MARINE CORPS SCHOOL AT QUANTICO VIRGINIA
LJ039-0081 REFERRING TO A RIFLE WITH A FOURPOWER TELESCOPE SERGEANT ZAHM SAID QUOTE
LJ039-0082 THIS IS THE IDEAL TYPE OF WEAPON FOR MOVING TARGETS
LJ039-0083 USING THE SCOPE RAPIDLY WORKING A BOLT AND USING THE SCOPE TO RELOCATE YOUR TARGET QUICKLY AND AT THE SAME TIME WHEN YOU LOCATE THAT TARGET
LJ039-0084 YOU IDENTIFY IT AND THE CROSSHAIRS ARE IN CLOSE RELATIONSHIP TO THE POINT YOU WANT TO SHOOT AT
LJ039-0085 IT JUST TAKES A MINOR MOVE IN AIMING TO BRING THE CROSSHAIRS TO BEAR AND THEN IT IS A QUICK SQUEEZE
LJ039-0086 I CONSIDER IT A REAL ADVANTAGE PARTICULARLY AT THE RANGE OF 100 YARDS IN IDENTIFYING YOUR TARGET
LJ039-0087 IT ALLOWS YOU TO SEE YOUR TARGET CLEARLY AND IT IS STILL OF A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF POWER THAT IT DOESN'T EXAGGERATE YOUR OWN BODY MOVEMENTS
LJ039-0088 IT JUST IS AN AID IN SEEING IN THE FACT THAT YOU ONLY HAVE THE ONE ELEMENT THE CROSSHAIR
LJ039-0089 IN RELATION TO THE TARGET AS OPPOSED TO IRON SIGHTS WITH ALIGNING THE SIGHTS AND THEN ALIGNING THEM ON THE TARGET END QUOTE
LJ039-0090 CHARACTERIZING THE FOURPOWER SCOPE AS QUOTE A REAL AID AN EXTREME AID END QUOTE IN RAPID FIRE SHOOTING
LJ039-0091 SERGEANT ZAHM EXPRESSED THE OPINION THAT THE SHOT WHICH STRUCK PRESIDENT KENNEDY IN THE NECK AT 176.9
LJ039-0092 TO 190.8 FEET WAS QUOTE VERY EASY END QUOTE AND THE SHOT WHICH STRUCK THE PRESIDENT IN THE HEAD
LJ039-0093 AT A DISTANCE OF 265.3 FEET WAS QUOTE AN EASY SHOT END QUOTE
LJ039-0094 AFTER VIEWING PHOTOGRAPHS DEPICTING THE ALIGNMENT OF ELM STREET IN RELATION TO THE TEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY BUILDING
LJ039-0095 ZAHM STATED FURTHER QUOTE
LJ039-0096 THIS IS A DEFINITE ADVANTAGE TO THE SHOOTER THE VEHICLE MOVING DIRECTLY AWAY FROM HIM AND THE DOWNGRADE OF THE STREET AND HE BEING IN AN ELEVATED POSITION
LJ039-0097 MADE AN ALMOST STATIONARY TARGET WHILE HE WAS AIMING IN VERY LITTLE MOVEMENT IF ANY END QUOTE
LJ039-0098 OSWALD'S MARINE TRAINING
LJ039-0099 IN ACCORDANCE WITH STANDARD MARINE PROCEDURES OSWALD RECEIVED EXTENSIVE TRAINING IN MARKSMANSHIP
LJ039-0100 DURING THE FIRST WEEK OF AN INTENSIVE 8WEEK TRAINING PERIOD HE RECEIVED INSTRUCTION IN SIGHTING AIMING AND MANIPULATION OF THE TRIGGER
LJ039-0101 HE WENT THROUGH A SERIES OF EXERCISES CALLED DRY FIRING WHERE HE ASSUMED ALL POSITIONS WHICH WOULD LATER BE USED IN THE QUALIFICATION COURSE
LJ039-0102 AFTER FAMILIARIZATION WITH LIVE AMMUNITION IN THE .22 RIFLE AND THE .22 PISTOL
LJ039-0103 OSWALD LIKE ALL MARINE RECRUITS RECEIVED TRAINING ON THE RIFLE RANGE AT DISTANCES UP TO 500 YARDS
LJ039-0104 FIRING 50 ROUNDS EACH DAY FOR FIVE DAYS
LJ039-0105 FOLLOWING THAT TRAINING OSWALD WAS TESTED IN DECEMBER OF NINETEEN FIFTY SIX AND OBTAINED A SCORE OF 212
LJ039-0106 WHICH WAS 2 POINTS ABOVE THE MINIMUM FOR QUALIFICATIONS AS A SHARPSHOOTER IN A SCALE OF MARKSMAN SHARPSHOOTER EXPERT
LJ039-0107 IN MAY OF NINETEEN FIFTY NINE ON ANOTHER RANGE OSWALD SCORED 191 WHICH WAS 1 POINT OVER THE MINIMUM FOR RANKING AS A MARKSMAN
LJ039-0108 THE MARINE CORPS RECORDS MAINTAINED ON OSWALD FURTHER SHOW THAT HE HAD FIRED AND WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE BROWNING AUTOMATIC RIFLE
LJ039-0109 .45 CALIBER PISTOL AND 12GAUGE RIOT GUN
LJ039-0110 BASED ON THE GENERAL MARINE CORPS RATINGS LT. COL. A. G. FOLSOM JR
LJ039-0111 HEAD RECORDS BRANCH PERSONNEL DEPARTMENT HEADQUARTERS U.S. MARINE CORPS
LJ039-0112 EVALUATED THE SHARPSHOOTER QUALIFICATION AS A QUOTE FAIRLY GOOD SHOT END QUOTE AND A LOW MARKSMAN RATING
LJ039-0113 AS A QUOTE RATHER POOR SHOT END QUOTE
LJ039-0114 WHEN ASKED TO EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENT SCORES ACHIEVED BY OSWALD ON THE TWO OCCASIONS WHEN HE FIRED FOR RECORD
LJ039-0115 MAJOR ANDERSON SAID QUOTE WHEN HE FIRED THAT TWO TWELVE
LJ039-0116 HE HAD JUST COMPLETED A VERY INTENSIVE PRELIMINARY TRAINING PERIOD
LJ039-0117 HE HAD THE SERVICES OF AN EXPERIENCED HIGHLY TRAINED COACH
LJ039-0118 HE HAD HIGH MOTIVATION. HE HAD PRESUMABLY A GOOD TO EXCELLENT RIFLE AND GOOD AMMUNITION
LJ039-0119 WE HAVE NOTHING HERE TO SHOW UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS THE B COURSE WAS FIRED. IT MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN A BAD DAY FOR FIRING THE RIFLE
LJ039-0120 WINDY RAINY DARK. THERE IS LITTLE PROBABILITY THAT HE HAD GOOD EXPERT COACH
LJ039-0121 AND HE PROBABLY DIDN'T HAVE AS HIGH A MOTIVATION BECAUSE HE WAS NO LONGER IN RECRUIT TRAINING AND UNDER THE CARE OF THE DRILL INSTRUCTOR
LJ039-0122 THERE IS SOME POSSIBILITY THAT THE RIFLE HE WAS FIRING MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN AS GOOD A RIFLE AS THE RIFLE THAT HE WAS FIRING IN HIS A COURSE FIRING
LJ039-0123 BECAUSE HE MAY WELL HAVE CARRIED THIS RIFLE FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND IT GOT BANGED AROUND IN NORMAL USAGE
LJ039-0124 END QUOTE. MAJOR ANDERSON CONCLUDED QUOTE I WOULD SAY THAT AS COMPARED TO OTHER MARINES RECEIVING THE SAME TYPE OF TRAINING
LJ039-0125 THAT OSWALD WAS A GOOD SHOT SOMEWHAT BETTER THAN OR EQUAL TO  BETTER THAN THE AVERAGE LET US SAY
LJ039-0126 AS COMPARED TO A CIVILIAN WHO HAD NOT RECEIVED THIS INTENSIVE TRAINING HE WOULD BE CONSIDERED AS A GOOD TO EXCELLENT SHOT. END QUOTE
LJ039-0127 WHEN SERGEANT ZAHM WAS ASKED WHETHER OSWALD'S MARINE CORPS TRAINING WOULD HAVE MADE IT EASIER TO OPERATE A RIFLE WITH A FOURPOWER SCOPE HE REPLIED QUOTE
LJ039-0128 BASED ON THAT TRAINING HIS BASIC KNOWLEDGE IN SIGHT MANIPULATION AND TRIGGER SQUEEZE AND WHAT NOT I WOULD SAY THAT HE WOULD BE CAPABLE OF SIGHTING THAT RIFLE IN WELL
LJ039-0129 FIRING IT WITH TEN ROUNDS
LJ039-0130 AFTER REVIEWING OSWALD'S MARKSMANSHIP SCORES
LJ039-0131 SERGEANT ZAHM CONCLUDED QUOTE I WOULD SAY IN THE MARINE CORPS HE IS A GOOD SHOT SLIGHTLY ABOVE AVERAGE
LJ039-0132 AND AS COMPARED TO THE AVERAGE MALE OF HIS AGE THROUGHOUT THE CIVILIAN THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES THAT HE IS AN EXCELLENT SHOT END QUOTE
LJ039-0133 OSWALD'S RIFLE PRACTICE OUTSIDE THE MARINES
LJ039-0134 DURING ONE OF HIS LEAVES FROM THE MARINES OSWALD HUNTED WITH HIS BROTHER ROBERT
LJ039-0135 USING A .22 CALIBER BOLTACTION RIFLE BELONGING EITHER TO ROBERT OR ROBERT'S INLAWS
LJ039-0136 AFTER HE LEFT THE MARINES AND BEFORE DEPARTING FOR RUSSIA OSWALD HIS BROTHER AND A THIRD COMPANION WENT HUNTING FOR SQUIRRELS AND RABBITS
LJ039-0137 ON THAT OCCASION OSWALD AGAIN USED A BOLTACTION TWENTY TWO CALIBER RIFLE AND ACCORDING TO ROBERT
LJ039-0138 LEE OSWALD EXHIBITED AN AVERAGE AMOUNT OF PROFICIENCY WITH THAT WEAPON
LJ039-0139 OSWALD OBTAINED A HUNTING LICENSE JOINED A HUNTING CLUB AND WENT HUNTING ABOUT SIX TIMES AS DISCUSSED MORE FULLY IN CHAPTER 6
LJ039-0140 SOON AFTER OSWALD RETURNED FROM THE SOVIET UNION
LJ039-0141 HE AGAIN WENT HUNTING WITH HIS BROTHER ROBERT AND USED A BORROWED .22 CALIBER BOLTACTION RIFLE
LJ039-0142 AFTER OSWALD PURCHASED THE MANNLICHERCARCANO RIFLE HE TOLD HIS WIFE THAT HE PRACTICED WITH IT
LJ039-0143 MARINA OSWALD TESTIFIED THAT ON ONE OCCASION SHE SAW HIM TAKE THE RIFLE CONCEALED IN A RAINCOAT FROM THE HOUSE ON NEELY STREET
LJ039-0144 OSWALD TOLD HER HE WAS GOING TO PRACTICE WITH IT
LJ039-0145 ACCORDING TO GEORGE DE MOHRENSCHILDT OSWALD SAID THAT HE WENT TARGET SHOOTING WITH THAT RIFLE
LJ039-0146 MARINA OSWALD TESTIFIED THAT IN NEW ORLEANS IN MAY OF NINETEEN SIXTY THREE SHE OBSERVED OSWALD SITTING WITH THE RIFLE ON THEIR SCREENED PORCH AT NIGHT
LJ039-0147 SIGHTING WITH THE TELESCOPIC LENS AND OPERATING THE BOLT
LJ039-0148 EXAMINATION OF THE CARTRIDGE CASES FOUND ON THE SIXTH FLOOR OF THE DEPOSITORY BUILDING
LJ039-0149 ESTABLISHED THAT THEY HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY LOADED AND EJECTED FROM THE ASSASSINATION RIFLE
LJ039-0150 WHICH WOULD INDICATE THAT OSWALD PRACTICED OPERATING THE BOLT
LJ039-0151 ACCURACY OF WEAPON
LJ039-0152 IT WILL BE RECALLED FROM THE DISCUSSION IN CHAPTER 3
LJ039-0153 THAT THE ASSASSIN IN ALL PROBABILITY HIT TWO OUT OF THE THREE SHOTS DURING THE MAXIMUM TIME SPAN OF
LJ039-0154 4.8 TO 5.6 SECONDS IF THE SECOND SHOT MISSED
LJ039-0155 OR IF EITHER THE FIRST OR THIRD SHOTS MISSED THE ASSASSIN FIRED THE THREE SHOTS DURING A MINIMUM TIME SPAN OF 7.1
LJ039-0156 TO 7.9 SECONDS
LJ039-0157 A SERIES OF TESTS WERE PERFORMED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE WEAPON AND AMMUNITION USED IN THE ASSASSINATION
LJ039-0158 WERE CAPABLE OF FIRING THE SHOTS WHICH WERE FIRED BY THE ASSASSIN ON NOVEMBER 22 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ039-0159 THE AMMUNITION USED BY THE ASSASSIN WAS MANUFACTURED BY WESTERN CARTRIDGE CO. OF EAST ALTON ILLINOIS
LJ039-0160 IN TESTS WITH THE MANNLICHERCARCANO C2766 RIFLE OVER 100 ROUNDS OF THIS AMMUNITION WERE FIRED BY THE FBI
LJ039-0161 AND THE INFANTRY WEAPONS EVALUATION BRANCH OF THE U.S. ARMY. THERE WERE NO MISFIRES
LJ039-0162 IN AN EFFORT TO TEST THE RIFLE UNDER CONDITIONS WHICH SIMULATED THOSE WHICH PREVAILED DURING THE ASSASSINATION
LJ039-0163 THE INFANTRY WEAPONS EVALUATION BRANCH OF THE BALLISTICS RESEARCH LABORATORY HAD EXPERT RIFLEMEN FIRE THE ASSASSINATION WEAPON
LJ039-0164 FROM A TOWER AT THREE SILHOUETTE TARGETS AT DISTANCES OF 175 240 AND 265 FEET
LJ039-0165 THE TARGET AT 265 FEET WAS PLACED TO THE RIGHT OF THE 240FOOT TARGET
LJ039-0166 WHICH WAS IN TURN PLACED TO THE RIGHT OF THE CLOSEST SILHOUETTE
LJ039-0167 USING THE ASSASSINATION RIFLE MOUNTED WITH THE TELESCOPIC SIGHT THREE MARKSMEN RATED AS MASTER BY THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION
LJ039-0168 EACH FIRED TWO SERIES OF THREE SHOTS
LJ039-0169 IN THE FIRST SERIES THE FIRERS REQUIRED TIME SPANS OF 4.6 6.75
LJ039-0170 AND 8.25 SECONDS RESPECTIVELY
LJ039-0171 ON THE SECOND SERIES THEY REQUIRED 5.15 6.45 AND 7 SECONDS
LJ039-0172 NONE OF THE MARKSMEN HAD ANY PRACTICE WITH THE ASSASSINATION WEAPON EXCEPT FOR EXERCISING THE BOLT FOR 2 OR 3 MINUTES ON A DRY RUN
LJ039-0173 THEY HAD NOT EVEN PULLED THE TRIGGER BECAUSE OF CONCERN ABOUT BREAKING THE FIRING PIN
LJ039-0174 THE MARKSMEN TOOK AS MUCH TIME AS THEY WANTED FOR THE FIRST TARGET AND ALL HIT THE TARGET
LJ039-0175 FOR THE FIRST FOUR ATTEMPTS THE FIRERS MISSED THE SECOND SHOT BY SEVERAL INCHES
LJ039-0176 THE ANGLE FROM THE FIRST TO THE SECOND SHOT
LJ039-0177 WAS GREATER THAN FROM THE SECOND TO THE THIRD SHOT AND REQUIRED A MOVEMENT IN THE BASIC FIRING POSITION OF THE MARKSMEN
LJ039-0178 THIS ANGLE WAS USED IN THE TEST BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF THE EYEWITNESSES TO THE ASSASSINATION
LJ039-0179 STATED THAT THERE WAS A SHORTER INTERVAL BETWEEN SHOTS TWO AND THREE THAN BETWEEN SHOTS ONE AND TWO
LJ039-0180 AS HAS BEEN SHOWN IN CHAPTER 3 IF THE THREE SHOTS WERE FIRED WITHIN A PERIOD OF FROM 4.8 TO 5.6 SECONDS
LJ039-0181 THE SHOTS WOULD HAVE BEEN EVENLY SPACED AND THE ASSASSIN WOULD NOT HAVE INCURRED SO SHARP AN ANGULAR MOVEMENT
LJ039-0182 FIVE OF THE SIX SHOTS HIT THE THIRD TARGET WHERE THE ANGLE OF MOVEMENT OF THE WEAPON WAS SMALL
LJ039-0183 ON THE BASIS OF THESE RESULTS SIMMONS TESTIFIED THAT IN HIS OPINION THE PROBABILITY OF HITTING THE TARGETS AT THE RELATIVELY SHORT RANGE AT WHICH THEY WERE HIT
LJ039-0184 CONSIDERING THE VARIOUS PROBABILITIES WHICH MAY HAVE PREVAILED DURING THE ACTUAL ASSASSINATION
LJ039-0185 THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF FIRING PERFORMANCE WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN REQUIRED OF THE ASSASSIN AND THE C2766 RIFLE
LJ039-0186 WOULD HAVE BEEN TO FIRE THREE TIMES AND HIT THE TARGET TWICE WITHIN A SPAN OF 4.8 TO 5.6 SECONDS
LJ039-0187 IN FACT ONE OF THE FIRERS IN THE RAPID FIRE TEST IN FIRING HIS TWO SERIES OF THREE SHOTS
LJ039-0188 HIT THE TARGET TWICE WITHIN A SPAN OF 4.6 AND 5.15 SECONDS
LJ039-0189 THE OTHERS WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REDUCE THEIR TIMES IF THEY HAD BEEN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME FAMILIAR WITH THE MOVEMENT OF THE BOLT AND THE TRIGGER PULL
LJ039-0190 SIMMONS TESTIFIED THAT FAMILIARITY WITH THE BOLT COULD BE ACHIEVED IN DRY PRACTICE AND AS HAS BEEN INDICATED ABOVE
LJ039-0191 OSWALD ENGAGED IN SUCH PRACTICE. IF THE ASSASSIN MISSED EITHER THE FIRST OR THIRD SHOT
LJ039-0192 HE HAD A TOTAL OF BETWEEN 4.8 AND 5.6 SECONDS BETWEEN THE TWO SHOTS WHICH HIT
LJ039-0193 AND A TOTAL MINIMUM TIME PERIOD OF FROM 7.1 TO 7.9 SECONDS FOR ALL THREE SHOTS
LJ039-0194 ALL THREE OF THE FIRERS IN THESE TESTS
LJ039-0195 WERE ABLE TO FIRE THE ROUNDS WITHIN THE TIME PERIOD WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE TO THE ASSASSIN UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS
LJ039-0196 THREE FBI FIREARMS EXPERTS TESTED THE RIFLE IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE SPEED WITH WHICH IT COULD BE FIRED
LJ039-0197 THE PURPOSE OF THIS EXPERIMENT WAS NOT TO TEST THE RIFLE UNDER CONDITIONS WHICH PREVAILED AT THE TIME OF THE ASSASSINATION
LJ039-0198 BUT TO DETERMINE THE MAXIMUM SPEED AT WHICH IT COULD BE FIRED
LJ039-0199 THE THREE FBI EXPERTS EACH FIRED THREE SHOTS FROM THE WEAPON AT 15 YARDS IN 6 7 AND 9 SECONDS
LJ039-0200 AND ONE OF THESE AGENTS ROBERT A. FRAZIER
LJ039-0201 FIRED TWO SERIES OF THREE SHOTS AT 25 YARDS IN 4.6 AND 4.8 SECONDS
LJ039-0202 AT FIFTEEN YARDS EACH MAN'S SHOTS LANDED WITHIN THE SIZE OF A DIME
LJ039-0203 THE SHOTS FIRED BY FRAZIER AT THE RANGE OF 25 YARDS LANDED WITHIN AN AREA OF 2 INCHES AND 5 INCHES RESPECTIVELY
LJ039-0204 FRAZIER LATER FIRED FOUR GROUPS OF THREE SHOTS AT A DISTANCE OF 100 YARDS IN 5.9 6.2
LJ039-0205 5.6 AND 6.5 SECONDS
LJ039-0206 EACH SERIES OF THREE SHOTS LANDED WITHIN AREAS RANGING IN DIAMETER FROM 3 TO 5 INCHES
LJ039-0207 ALTHOUGH ALL OF THE SHOTS WERE A FEW INCHES HIGH AND TO THE RIGHT OF THE TARGET
LJ039-0208 THIS WAS BECAUSE OF A DEFECT IN THE SCOPE WHICH WAS RECOGNIZED BY THE FBI AGENTS AND WHICH THEY COULD HAVE COMPENSATED FOR IF THEY WERE AIMING TO HIT A BULL'SEYE
LJ039-0209 THEY WERE INSTEAD FIRING TO DETERMINE HOW RAPIDLY THE WEAPON COULD BE FIRED AND THE AREA WITHIN WHICH THREE SHOTS COULD BE PLACED
LJ039-0210 FRAZIER TESTIFIED THAT WHILE HE COULD NOT TELL WHEN THE DEFECT OCCURRED BUT THAT A PERSON FAMILIAR WITH THE WEAPON COULD COMPENSATE FOR IT
LJ039-0211 MOREOVER THE DEFECT WAS ONE WHICH WOULD HAVE ASSISTED THE ASSASSIN AIMING AT A TARGET WHICH WAS MOVING AWAY
LJ039-0212 FRAZIER SAID QUOTE THE FACT THAT THE CROSSHAIRS ARE SET HIGH WOULD ACTUALLY COMPENSATE FOR ANY LEAD WHICH HAD TO BE TAKEN
LJ039-0213 SO THAT IF YOU AIMED WITH THIS WEAPON AS IT ACTUALLY WAS RECEIVED AT THE LABORATORY IT WOULD NOT BE NECESSARY TO TAKE ANY LEAD WHATSOEVER
LJ039-0214 IN ORDER TO HIT THE INTENDED OBJECT. THE SCOPE WOULD ACCOMPLISH THE LEAD FOR YOU END QUOTE
LJ039-0215 FRAZIER ADDED THAT THE SCOPE WOULD CAUSE A SLIGHT MISS TO THE RIGHT
LJ039-0216 IT SHOULD BE NOTED HOWEVER THAT THE PRESIDENT'S CAR WAS CURVING SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT WHEN THE THIRD SHOT WAS FIRED
LJ039-0217 BASED ON THESE TESTS THE EXPERTS AGREED THAT THE ASSASSINATION RIFLE WAS AN ACCURATE WEAPON
LJ039-0218 SIMMONS DESCRIBED IT AS QUOTE QUITE ACCURATE END QUOTE IN FACT AS ACCURATE AS CURRENT MILITARY RIFLES
LJ039-0219 FRAZIER TESTIFIED THAT THE RIFLE WAS ACCURATE THAT IT HAD LESS RECOIL THAN THE AVERAGE MILITARY RIFLE
LJ039-0220 AND THAT ONE WOULD NOT HAVE TO BE AN EXPERT MARKSMAN TO HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THE ASSASSINATION WITH THE WEAPON WHICH WAS USED
LJ039-0221 THE VARIOUS TESTS SHOWED THAT THE MANNLICHERCARCANO WAS AN ACCURATE RIFLE AND THAT THE USE OF A FOURPOWER SCOPE
LJ039-0222 WAS A SUBSTANTIAL AID TO RAPID ACCURATE FIRING
LJ039-0223 OSWALD'S MARINE TRAINING IN MARKSMANSHIP HIS OTHER RIFLE EXPERIENCE AND HIS ESTABLISHED FAMILIARITY WITH THIS PARTICULAR WEAPON
LJ039-0224 SHOW THAT HE POSSESSED AMPLE CAPABILITY TO COMMIT THE ASSASSINATION
LJ039-0225 BASED ON THE KNOWN FACTS OF THE ASSASSINATION
LJ039-0226 THE MARINE MARKSMANSHIP EXPERTS MAJOR ANDERSON AND SERGEANT ZAHM CONCURRED IN THE OPINION THAT OSWALD HAD THE CAPABILITY TO FIRE THREE SHOTS
LJ039-0227 WITH TWO HITS WITHIN 4.8 AND 5.6 SECONDS
LJ039-0228 CONCERNING THE SHOTS WHICH STRUCK THE PRESIDENT IN THE BACK OF THE NECK
LJ039-0229 SERGEANT ZAHM TESTIFIED QUOTE
LJ039-0230 WITH THE EQUIPMENT HE [OSWALD] HAD AND WITH HIS ABILITY I CONSIDER IT A VERY EASY SHOT END QUOTE
LJ039-0231 HAVING FIRED THIS SLOT
LJ039-0232 THE ASSASSIN WAS THEN REQUIRED TO HIT THE TARGET ONE MORE TIME WITHIN A SPACE OF FROM 4.8 TO 5.6 SECONDS
LJ039-0233 ON THE BASIS OF OSWALD'S TRAINING AND THE ACCURACY OF THE WEAPON AS ESTABLISHED BY THE TESTS
LJ039-0234 THE COMMISSION CONCLUDED THAT OSWALD WAS CAPABLE OF ACCOMPLISHING THIS SECOND HIT EVEN IF THERE WAS AN INTERVENING SHOT WHICH MISSED
LJ039-0235 THE PROBABILITY OF HITTING THE PRESIDENT A SECOND TIME WOULD HAVE BEEN MARKEDLY INCREASED IF IN FACT HE HAD MISSED EITHER THE FIRST OR THIRD SHOTS
LJ039-0236 THEREBY LEAVING A TIME SPAN OF 4.8 TO 5.6 SECONDS BETWEEN THE TWO SHOTS WHICH STRUCK THEIR MARK
LJ039-0237 THE COMMISSION AGREES WITH THE TESTIMONY OF MARINE MARKSMANSHIP EXPERT ZAHM
LJ039-0238 THAT IT WAS AN EASY SHOT TO HIT SOME PART OF THE PRESIDENT'S BODY AND THAT THE RANGE WHERE THE RIFLEMAN WOULD BE EXPECTED TO HIT
LJ039-0239 WOULD INCLUDE THE PRESIDENT'S HEAD
LJ039-0240 ON THE BASIS OF THE EVIDENCE REVIEWED IN THIS CHAPTER THE COMMISSION HAS FOUND THAT LEE HARVEY OSWALD ONE
LJ039-0241 OWNED AND POSSESSED THE RIFLE USED TO KILL PRESIDENT KENNEDY AND WOUND GOVERNOR CONNALLY
LJ039-0242 2 BROUGHT THIS RIFLE INTO THE DEPOSITORY BUILDING ON THE MORNING OF THE ASSASSINATION
LJ039-0243 3 WAS PRESENT AT THE TIME OF THE ASSASSINATION AT THE WINDOW FROM WHICH THE SHOTS WERE FIRED
LJ039-0244 KILLED DALLAS POLICE OFFICER J. D. TIPPIT IN AN APPARENT ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
LJ039-0245 5 RESISTED ARREST BY DRAWING A FULLY LOADED PISTOL AND ATTEMPTING TO SHOOT ANOTHER POLICE OFFICER
LJ039-0246 6 LIED TO THE POLICE AFTER HIS ARREST CONCERNING IMPORTANT SUBSTANTIVE MATTERS
LJ039-0247 7 ATTEMPTED IN APRIL NINETEEN SIXTY THREE TO KILL MAJ. GEN. EDWIN A. WALKER AND 8
LJ039-0248 POSSESSED THE CAPABILITY WITH A RIFLE WHICH WOULD HAVE ENABLED HIM TO COMMIT THE ASSASSINATION
LJ040-0001 REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION ON THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY. THE WARREN COMMISSION REPORT. BY THE PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION ON THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY
LJ040-0002 CHAPTER 7. LEE HARVEY OSWALD BACKGROUND AND POSSIBLE MOTIVES PART ONE
LJ040-0003 THE EVIDENCE REVIEWED ABOVE IDENTIFIES LEE HARVEY OSWALD AS THE ASSASSIN OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY AND INDICATES THAT HE ACTED ALONE IN THAT EVENT
LJ040-0004 THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE HAD ACCOMPLICES OR THAT HE WAS INVOLVED IN ANY CONSPIRACY DIRECTED TO THE ASSASSINATION OF THE PRESIDENT
LJ040-0005 THERE REMAINS THE QUESTION OF WHAT IMPELLED OSWALD TO CONCEIVE AND TO CARRY OUT THE ASSASSINATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
LJ040-0006 THE COMMISSION HAS CONSIDERED MANY POSSIBLE MOTIVES FOR THE ASSASSINATION INCLUDING THOSE WHICH MIGHT FLOW FROM OSWALD'S COMMITMENT TO MARXISM OR COMMUNISM
LJ040-0007 THE EXISTENCE OF SOME PERSONAL GRIEVANCE
LJ040-0008 A DESIRE TO EFFECT CHANGES IN THE STRUCTURE OF SOCIETY OR SIMPLY TO GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS A WELL PUBLICIZED ASSASSIN
LJ040-0009 NONE OF THESE POSSIBILITIES SATISFACTORILY EXPLAINS OSWALD'S ACT IF IT IS JUDGED BY THE STANDARDS OF REASONABLE MEN
LJ040-0010 THE MOTIVES OF ANY MAN HOWEVER MUST BE ANALYZED IN TERMS OF THE CHARACTER AND STATE OF MIND OF THE PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL INVOLVED
LJ040-0011 FOR A MOTIVE THAT APPEARS INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO OTHER MEN MAY BE THE MOVING FORCE OF A MAN WHOSE VIEW OF THE WORLD HAS BEEN TWISTED
LJ040-0012 POSSIBLY BY FACTORS OF WHICH THOSE AROUND HIM WERE ONLY DIMLY AWARE
LJ040-0013 OSWALD'S COMPLETE STATE OF MIND AND CHARACTER ARE NOW OUTSIDE OF THE POWER OF MAN TO KNOW
LJ040-0014 HE CANNOT OF COURSE BE QUESTIONED OR OBSERVED BY THOSE CHARGED WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS REPORT OR BY EXPERTS ON THEIR BEHALF
LJ040-0015 THERE IS HOWEVER A LARGE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL AVAILABLE IN HIS WRITINGS
LJ040-0016 AND IN THE HISTORY OF HIS LIFE WHICH DOES GIVE SOME INSIGHT INTO HIS CHARACTER AND POSSIBLY INTO THE MOTIVES FOR HIS ACT
LJ040-0017 SINCE OSWALD IS DEAD
LJ040-0018 THE COMMISSION IS NOT ABLE TO REACH ANY DEFINITE CONCLUSIONS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT HE WAS QUOTE SANE UNQUOTE UNDER PREVAILING LEGAL STANDARDS
LJ040-0019 UNDER OUR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE NO FORUM COULD PROPERLY MAKE THAT DETERMINATION UNLESS OSWALD WERE BEFORE IT
LJ040-0020 IT CERTAINLY COULD NOT BE MADE BY THIS COMMISSION WHICH AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT ABOVE
LJ040-0021 ASCERTAINED THE FACTS SURROUNDING THE ASSASSINATION BUT DID NOT DRAW CONCLUSIONS CONCERNING OSWALD'S LEGAL GUILT
LJ040-0022 INDICATIONS OF OSWALD'S MOTIVATION
LJ040-0023 MAY BE OBTAINED FROM A STUDY OF THE EVENTS RELATIONSHIPS AND INFLUENCES WHICH APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT IN SHAPING HIS CHARACTER AND IN GUIDING HIM
LJ040-0024 PERHAPS THE MOST OUTSTANDING CONCLUSION OF SUCH A STUDY IS THAT OSWALD WAS PROFOUNDLY ALIENATED FROM THE WORLD IN WHICH HE LIVED
LJ040-0025 HIS LIFE WAS CHARACTERIZED BY ISOLATION FRUSTRATION AND FAILURE
LJ040-0026 HE HAD VERY FEW IF ANY CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND HE APPEARED TO HAVE GREAT DIFFICULTY IN FINDING A MEANINGFUL PLACE IN THE WORLD
LJ040-0027 HE WAS NEVER SATISFIED WITH ANYTHING
LJ040-0028 WHEN HE WAS IN THE UNITED STATES HE RESENTED THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM WHICH HE THOUGHT WAS EXPLOITING HIM AND OTHERS LIKE HIM
LJ040-0029 HE SEEMED TO PREFER THE SOVIET UNION AND HE SPOKE HIGHLY OF CUBA
LJ040-0030 WHEN HE WAS IN THE SOVIET UNION HE APPARENTLY RESENTED THE COMMUNIST PARTY MEMBERS
LJ040-0031 WHO WERE ACCORDED SPECIAL PRIVILEGES AND WHO HE THOUGHT WERE BETRAYING COMMUNISM AND HE SPOKE WELL OF THE UNITED STATES
LJ040-0032 HE ACCUSED HIS WIFE OF PREFERRING OTHERS TO HIMSELF AND TOLD HER TO RETURN TO THE SOVIET UNION WITHOUT HIM BUT WITHOUT A DIVORCE
LJ040-0033 AT THE SAME TIME HE PROFESSED HIS LOVE FOR HER AND SAID THAT HE COULD NOT GET ALONG WITHOUT HER
LJ040-0034 MARINA OSWALD THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD NOT BE HAPPY ANYWHERE QUOTE ONLY ON THE MOON PERHAPS END QUOTE
LJ040-0035 WHILE OSWALD APPEARED TO MOST OF THOSE WHO KNEW HIM AS A MEEK AND HARMLESS PERSON HE SOMETIMES IMAGINED HIMSELF AS QUOTE THE COMMANDER END QUOTE
LJ040-0036 AND APPARENTLY SERIOUSLY AS A POLITICAL PROPHET  A MAN WHO SAID THAT AFTER 20 YEARS HE WOULD BE PRIME MINISTER
LJ040-0037 HIS WIFE TESTIFIED THAT HE COMPARED HIMSELF WITH GREAT READERS OF HISTORY
LJ040-0038 SUCH IDEAS OF GRANDEUR WERE APPARENTLY ACCOMPANIED BY NOTIONS OF OPPRESSION
LJ040-0039 HE HAD A GREAT HOSTILITY TOWARD HIS ENVIRONMENT WHATEVER IT HAPPENED TO BE
LJ040-0040 WHICH HE EXPRESSED IN STRIKING AND SOMETIMES VIOLENT ACTS LONG BEFORE THE ASSASSINATION
LJ040-0041 THERE WAS SOME QUALITY ABOUT HIM THAT LED HIM TO ACT WITH AN APPARENT DISREGARD FOR POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES
LJ040-0042 HE DEFECTED TO THE SOVIET UNION SHOT AT GENERAL WALKER TRIED TO GO TO CUBA AND EVEN CONTEMPLATED HIJACKING AN AIRPLANE TO GET THERE
LJ040-0043 HE ASSASSINATED THE PRESIDENT SHOT OFFICER TIPPIT RESISTED ARREST AND TRIED TO KILL ANOTHER POLICEMAN IN THE PROCESS
LJ040-0044 OSWALD APPARENTLY STARTED READING ABOUT COMMUNISM WHEN HE WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN
LJ040-0045 IN THE MARINES HE EVIDENCED A STRONG CONVICTION AS TO THE CORRECTNESS OF MARXIST DOCTRINE
LJ040-0046 WHICH ONE ASSOCIATE DESCRIBED AS QUOTE IRREVOCABLE END QUOTE BUT ALSO AS QUOTE THEORETICAL END QUOTE
LJ040-0047 THAT ASSOCIATE DID NOT THINK THAT OSWALD WAS A COMMUNIST
LJ040-0048 OSWALD DID NOT ALWAYS DISTINGUISH BETWEEN MARXISM AND COMMUNISM
LJ040-0049 HE STATED SEVERAL TIMES THAT HE WAS A COMMUNIST BUT APPARENTLY NEVER JOINED ANY COMMUNIST PARTY
LJ040-0050 HIS ATTACHMENT TO MARXIST AND COMMUNIST DOCTRINE WAS PROBABLY IN SOME MEASURE AN EXPRESSION OF HIS HOSTILITY TO HIS ENVIRONMENT
LJ040-0051 WHILE THERE IS DOUBT ABOUT HOW FULLY OSWALD UNDERSTOOD THE DOCTRINE WHICH HE SO OFTEN ESPOUSED IT SEEMS CLEAR
LJ040-0052 THAT HIS COMMITMENT TO MARXISM WAS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR INFLUENCING HIS CONDUCT DURING HIS ADULT YEARS
LJ040-0053 IT WAS AN OBVIOUS ELEMENT IN HIS DECISION TO GO TO RUSSIA AND LATER TO CUBA AND IT PROBABLY INFLUENCED HIS DECISION TO SHOOT AT GENERAL WALKER
LJ040-0054 IT WAS A FACTOR WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO HIS CHARACTER AND THEREBY MIGHT HAVE INFLUENCED HIS DECISION TO ASSASSINATE PRESIDENT KENNEDY
LJ040-0055 THE DISCUSSION BELOW WILL DESCRIBE THE EVENTS KNOWN TO THE COMMISSION WHICH MOST CLEARLY REVEALS THE FORMATION AND NATURE OF OSWALD'S CHARACTER
LJ040-0056 IT WILL ATTEMPT TO SUMMARIZE THE EVENTS OF HIS EARLY LIFE HIS EXPERIENCE IN NEW YORK CITY AND IN THE MARINE CORPS AND HIS INTEREST IN MARXISM
LJ040-0057 IT WILL EXAMINE HIS DEFECTION TO THE SOVIET UNION IN NINETEEN FIFTY NINE HIS SUBSEQUENT RETURN TO THE UNITED STATES AND HIS LIFE HERE
LJ040-0058 AFTER JUNE OF NINETEEN SIXTY TWO
LJ040-0059 THE REVIEW OF THE LATTER PERIOD WILL EVALUATE HIS PERSONAL AND EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS HIS ATTEMPT TO KILL GENERAL WALKER HIS POLITICAL ACTIVITIES
LJ040-0060 AND HIS UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO GO TO CUBA IN LATE SEPTEMBER OF NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ040-0061 VARIOUS POSSIBLE MOTIVES WILL BE TREATED IN THE APPROPRIATE CONTEXT OF THE DISCUSSION OUTLINED ABOVE
LJ040-0062 THE EARLY YEARS
LJ040-0063 SIGNIFICANT IN SHAPING THE CHARACTER OF LEE HARVEY OSWALD WAS THE DEATH OF HIS FATHER A COLLECTOR OF INSURANCE PREMIUMS
LJ040-0064 THIS OCCURRED 2 MONTHS BEFORE LEE WAS BORN IN NEW ORLEANS ON OCTOBER 18 NINETEEN THIRTY NINE
LJ040-0065 THAT DEATH STRAINED THE FINANCIAL FORTUNES OF THE REMAINDER OF THE OSWALD FAMILY
LJ040-0066 IT HAD ITS EFFECT ON LEE'S MOTHER MARGUERITE HIS BROTHER ROBERT WHO HAD BEEN BORN IN NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR
LJ040-0067 AND HIS HALFBROTHER JOHN PIC WHO HAD BEEN BORN IN NINETEEN THIRTY TWO DURING MARGUERITE'S PREVIOUS MARRIAGE
LJ040-0068 IT FORCED MARGUERITE OSWALD TO GO TO WORK TO PROVIDE FOR HER FAMILY
LJ040-0069 REMINDING HER SONS THAT THEY WERE ORPHANS AND THAT THE FAMILY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION WAS POOR
LJ040-0070 SHE PLACED JOHN PIC AND ROBERT OSWALD IN AN ORPHANS' HOME
LJ040-0071 FROM THE TIME MARGUERITE OSWALD RETURNED TO WORK UNTIL DECEMBER 26 1942 WHEN LEE TOO WAS SENT TO THE ORPHANS' HOME
LJ040-0072 HE WAS CARED FOR PRINCIPALLY BY HIS MOTHER'S SISTER BY BABYSITTERS AND BY HIS MOTHER WHEN SHE HAD TIME FOR HIM
LJ040-0073 MARGUERITE OSWALD WITHDREW LEE FROM THE ORPHANS' HOME AND TOOK HIM WITH HER TO DALLAS WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE OVER 4 YEARS OLD
LJ040-0074 ABOUT 6 MONTHS LATER SHE ALSO WITHDREW JOHN PIC AND ROBERT OSWALD
LJ040-0075 APPARENTLY THAT ACTION WAS TAKEN IN ANTICIPATION OF HER MARRIAGE TO EDWIN A. EKDAHL WHICH TOOK PLACE IN MAY OF NINETEEN FORTY FIVE
LJ040-0076 IN THE FALL OF THAT YEAR JOHN PIC AND ROBERT OSWALD WENT TO A MILITARY ACADEMY
LJ040-0077 WHERE THEY STAYED EXCEPT FOR VACATIONS UNTIL THE SPRING OF NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT
LJ040-0078 LEE OSWALD REMAINED WITH HIS MOTHER AND EKDAHL TO WHOM HE BECAME QUITE ATTACHED
LJ040-0079 JOHN PIC TESTIFIED THAT HE THOUGHT LEE FOUND IN EKDAHL THE FATHER THAT HE NEVER HAD
LJ040-0080 THAT SITUATION HOWEVER WAS SHORTLIVED
LJ040-0081 FOR THE RELATIONS BETWEEN MARGUERITE OSWALD AND EKDAHL WERE STORMY AND THEY WERE FINALLY DIVORCED AFTER SEVERAL SEPARATIONS AND REUNIONS
LJ040-0082 IN THE SUMMER OF NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT
LJ040-0083 AFTER THE DIVORCE MRS. OSWALD COMPLAINED CONSIDERABLY ABOUT HOW UNFAIRLY SHE WAS TREATED
LJ040-0084 DWELLING ON THE FACT THAT SHE WAS A WIDOW WITH THREE CHILDREN
LJ040-0085 JOHN PIC HOWEVER DID NOT THINK HER POSITION WAS WORSE THAN THAT OF MANY OTHER PEOPLE
LJ040-0086 IN THE FALL OF NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT SHE TOLD JOHN PIC AND ROBERT OSWALD
LJ040-0087 THAT SHE COULD NOT AFFORD TO SEND THEM BACK TO THE MILITARY SCHOOL AND SHE ASKED PIC TO QUIT SCHOOL ENTIRELY TO HELP SUPPORT THE FAMILY
LJ040-0088 WHICH HE DID FOR 4 MONTHS IN THE FALL OF NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT
LJ040-0089 IN ORDER TO SUPPLEMENT THEIR INCOME FURTHER SHE FALSELY SWORE THAT PIC WAS SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD SO THAT HE COULD JOIN THE MARINE CORPS RESERVES
LJ040-0090 PIC DID TURN OVER PART OF HIS INCOME TO HIS MOTHER

LJ040-0102 RETURN TO IT FOR LUNCH AND THEN AGAIN AT NIGHT HIS MOTHER HAVING TRAINED HIM TO DO THAT RATHER THAN TO PLAY WITH OTHER CHILDREN
LJ040-0103 AN INDICATION OF THE NATURE OF LEE'S CHARACTER AT THIS TIME WAS PROVIDED IN THE SPRING OF NINETEEN FIFTY
LJ040-0104 WHEN HE WAS SENT TO NEW ORLEANS TO VISIT THE FAMILY OF HIS MOTHER'S SISTER MRS. LILLIAN MURRET FOR 2 OR 3 WEEKS
LJ040-0105 DESPITE THEIR URGINGS HE REFUSED TO PLAY WITH THE OTHER CHILDREN HIS OWN AGE
LJ040-0106 IT ALSO APPEARS THAT LEE TRIED TO TAG ALONG WITH HIS OLDER BROTHERS
LJ040-0107 BUT APPARENTLY WAS NOT ABLE TO SPEND AS MUCH TIME WITH THEM AS HE WOULD HAVE LIKED BECAUSE OF THE AGE GAPS OF 5 AND 7 YEARS
LJ040-0108 WHICH BECAME MORE SIGNIFICANT AS THE CHILDREN GREW OLDER

LJ040-0134 THAT ANYBODY ENTERING THIS HOME HAD TO BE SEARCHED IN CASE THE PARENTS WERE BRINGING CIGARETTES OR NARCOTICS OR ANYTHING END QUOTE
LJ040-0135 SHE RECALLED THAT LEE CRIED AND SAID QUOTE MOTHER I WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE
LJ040-0136 THERE ARE CHILDREN IN HERE WHO HAVE KILLED PEOPLE AND SMOKE. I WANT TO GET OUT END QUOTE
LJ040-0137 MARGUERITE OSWALD SAID THAT SHE HAD NOT REALIZED UNTIL THEN IN WHAT KIND OF PLACE HER SON HAD BEEN CONFINED

LJ040-0142 WAS DISTURBED ABOUT DISROBING IN FRONT OF THEM TAKING SHOWERS WITH THEM ETC. END QUOTE
LJ040-0143 CONTRARY TO REPORTS THAT APPEARED AFTER THE ASSASSINATION THE PSYCHIATRIC EXAMINATION DID NOT INDICATE THAT LEE OSWALD WAS A POTENTIAL ASSASSIN
LJ040-0144 POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS THAT QUOTE HIS OUTLOOK ON LIFE HAD STRONGLY PARANOID OVERTONES END QUOTE OR THAT HE SHOULD BE INSTITUTIONALIZED
LJ040-0145 DR. HARTOGS DID FIND OSWALD TO BE A TENSE WITHDRAWN AND EVASIVE BOY WHO INTENSELY DISLIKED TALKING ABOUT HIMSELF AND HIS FEELINGS
LJ040-0146 HE NOTED THAT LEE LIKED TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT HE DID NOT CARE FOR OTHER PEOPLE BUT PREFERRED TO KEEP TO HIMSELF
LJ040-0147 SO THAT HE WAS NOT BOTHERED AND DID NOT HAVE TO MAKE THE EFFORT OF COMMUNICATING
LJ040-0148 OSWALD'S WITHDRAWN TENDENCIES AND SOLITARY HABITS WERE THOUGHT TO BE THE RESULT OF QUOTE
LJ040-0149 INTENSE ANXIETY SHYNESS FEELINGS OF AWKWARDNESS AND INSECURITY END QUOTE

LJ040-0157 LEE HAS TO BE DIAGNOSED AS QUOTE PERSONALITY PATTERN DISTURBANCE WITH SCHIZOID FEATURES AND PASSIVEAGGRESSIVE TENDENCIES END QUOTE
LJ040-0158 LEE HAS TO BE SEEN AS AN EMOTIONALLY QUITE DISTURBED YOUNGSTER
LJ040-0159 WHO SUFFERS UNDER THE IMPACT OF REALLY EXISTING EMOTIONAL ISOLATION
LJ040-0160 AND DEPRIVATION LACK OF AFFECTION ABSENCE OF FAMILY LIFE AND REJECTION BY A SELF INVOLVED AND CONFLICTED MOTHER
LJ040-0161 DR. HARTOGS RECOMMENDED THAT OSWALD BE PLACED ON PROBATION ON CONDITION THAT HE SEEK HELP AND GUIDANCE THROUGH A CHILD GUIDANCE CLINIC
LJ040-0162 THERE HE SUGGESTED LEE SHOULD BE TREATED BY A MALE PSYCHIATRIST WHO COULD SUBSTITUTE FOR THE LACK OF A FATHER FIGURE
LJ040-0163 HE ALSO RECOMMENDED THAT MRS. OSWALD SEEK QUOTE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC GUIDANCE THROUGH CONTACT WITH A FAMILY AGENCY END QUOTE
LJ040-0164 THE POSSIBILITY OF COMMITMENT WAS TO BE CONSIDERED ONLY IF THE PROBATION PLAN WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL
LJ040-0165 LEE'S WITHDRAWAL WAS ALSO NOTED BY MRS. SIEGEL WHO DESCRIBED HIM AS A QUOTE SERIOUSLY DETACHED WITHDRAWN YOUNGSTER END QUOTE
LJ040-0166 SHE ALSO NOTED THAT THERE WAS QUOTE A RATHER PLEASANT APPEALING QUALITY ABOUT THIS EMOTIONALLY STARVED AFFECTIONLESS YOUNGSTER

LJ040-0168 SHE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD DETACHED HIMSELF FROM THE WORLD AROUND HIM BECAUSE QUOTE NO ONE IN IT EVER MET ANY OF HIS NEEDS FOR LOVE END QUOTE
LJ040-0169 SHE OBSERVED THAT SINCE LEE'S MOTHER WORKED ALL DAY HE MADE HIS OWN MEALS AND SPENT ALL HIS TIME ALONE
LJ040-0170 BECAUSE HE DIDN'T MAKE FRIENDS WITH THE BOYS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. SHE THOUGHT THAT HE QUOTE WITHDREW INTO A COMPLETELY SOLITARY AND DETACHED EXISTENCE
LJ040-0171 WHERE HE DID AS HE WANTED AND HE DIDN'T HAVE TO LIVE BY ANY RULES OR COME INTO CONTACT WITH PEOPLE END QUOTE
LJ040-0172 MRS. SIEGEL CONCLUDED THAT LEE QUOTE JUST FELT THAT HIS MOTHER NEVER GAVE A DAMN FOR HIM
LJ040-0173 HE ALWAYS FELT LIKE A BURDEN THAT SHE SIMPLY JUST HAD TO TOLERATE END QUOTE
LJ040-0174 LEE CONFIRMED SOME OF THOSE OBSERVATIONS BY SAYING THAT HE FELT ALMOST AS IF THERE WERE A VEIL BETWEEN HIM AND OTHER PEOPLE
LJ040-0175 THROUGH WHICH THEY COULD NOT REACH HIM BUT THAT HE PREFERRED THE VEIL TO REMAIN INTACT
LJ040-0176 HE ADMITTED TO FANTASIES ABOUT BEING POWERFUL AND SOMETIMES HURTING AND KILLING PEOPLE BUT REFUSED TO ELABORATE ON THEM
LJ040-0177 HE TOOK THE POSITION THAT SUCH MATTERS WERE HIS OWN BUSINESS
LJ040-0178 A PSYCHOLOGICAL HUMAN FIGUREDRAWING TEST CORROBORATED THE INTERVIEWER'S FINDINGS THAT LEE WAS INSECURE AND HAD LIMITED SOCIAL CONTACTS
LJ040-0179 IRVING SOKOLOW A YOUTH HOUSE PSYCHOLOGIST REPORTED THAT QUOTE
LJ040-0180 THE HUMAN FIGURE DRAWINGS ARE EMPTY POOR CHARACTERIZATIONS OF PERSONS APPROXIMATELY THE SAME AGE AS THE SUBJECT
LJ040-0181 THEY REFLECT A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF IMPOVERISHMENT IN THE SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL AREAS
LJ040-0182 HE APPEARS TO BE A SOMEWHAT INSECURE YOUNGSTER EXHIBITING MUCH INCLINATION FOR WARM AND SATISFYING RELATIONSHIPS TO OTHERS
LJ040-0183 THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT HE MAY RELATE TO MEN MORE EASILY THAN TO WOMEN IN VIEW OF THE MORE MATURE CONCEPTUALISATION
LJ040-0184 HE APPEARS SLIGHTLY WITHDRAWN AND IN VIEW OF THE LACK OF DETAIL WITHIN THE DRAWINGS THIS MAY ASSUME A MORE SIGNIFICANT CHARACTERISTIC
LJ040-0185 HE EXHIBITS SOME DIFFICULTY IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE MATERNAL FIGURE SUGGESTING MORE ANXIETY IN THIS AREA THAN IN ANY OTHER
LJ040-0186 LEE SCORED AN IQ OF 118 ON THE WECHSLER INTELLIGENCE SCALE FOR CHILDREN
LJ040-0187 ACCORDING TO SOKOLOW THIS INDICATED A QUOTE PRESENT INTELLECTUAL FUNCTIONING IN THE UPPER RANGE OF BRIGHT NORMAL INTELLIGENCE END QUOTE
LJ040-0188 SOKOLOW SAID THAT ALTHOUGH LEE WAS QUOTE PRESUMABLY DISINTERESTED IN SCHOOL SUBJECTS HE OPERATES ON A MUCH HIGHER THAN AVERAGE LEVEL END QUOTE
LJ040-0189 ON THE MONROE SILENT READING TEST LEE'S SCORE INDICATED NO RETARDATION IN READING SPEED AND COMPREHENSION
LJ040-0190 HE HAD BETTER THAN AVERAGE ABILITY IN ARITHMETICAL REASONING FOR HIS AGE GROUP
LJ040-0191 LEE TOLD CARRO HIS PROBATION OFFICER THAT HE LIKED TO BE BY HIMSELF BECAUSE HE HAD TOO MUCH DIFFICULTY IN MAKING FRIENDS
LJ040-0192 THE REPORTS OF CARRO AND MRS. SIEGEL ALSO INDICATE AN AMBIVALENT ATTITUDE TOWARD AUTHORITY ON OSWALD'S PART
LJ040-0193 CARRO REPORTED THAT LEE WAS DISRUPTIVE IN CLASS AFTER HE RETURNED TO SCHOOL ON A REGULAR BASIS IN THE FALL OF NINETEEN FIFTY THREE
LJ040-0194 HE HAD REFUSED TO SALUTE THE FLAG AND WAS DOING VERY LITTLE IF ANY WORK
LJ040-0195 IT APPEARS THAT HE DID NOT WANT TO DO ANY OF THE THINGS WHICH THE AUTHORITIES SUGGESTED IN THEIR EFFORTS TO BRING HIM OUT OF THE SHELL
LJ040-0196 INTO WHICH HE APPEARED TO BE RETREATING
LJ040-0197 HE TOLD MRS. SIEGEL THAT HE WOULD RUN AWAY IF SENT TO A BOARDING SCHOOL
LJ040-0198 ON THE OTHER HAND HE ALSO TOLD HER THAT HE WISHED HIS MOTHER HAD BEEN MORE FIRM WITH HIM IN HER ATTEMPTS TO GET HIM TO RETURN TO SCHOOL
LJ040-0199 THE REPORTS OF THE NEW YORK AUTHORITIES INDICATE THAT LEE'S MOTHER GAVE HIM VERY LITTLE AFFECTION AND DID NOT SERVE AS ANY SORT OF SUBSTITUTE FOR A FATHER
LJ040-0200 FURTHERMORE SHE DID NOT APPEAR TO UNDERSTAND HER OWN RELATIONSHIP TO LEE'S PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS
LJ040-0201 AFTER HER INTERVIEW WITH MRS. OSWALD
LJ040-0202 MRS. SIEGEL DESCRIBED HER AS A SMARTLY DRESSED GRAY HAIRED WOMAN VERY SELFPOSSESSED AND ALERT AND SUPERFICIALLY AFFABLE
LJ040-0203 BUT ESSENTIALLY A QUOTE DEFENSIVE RIGID SELFINVOLVED PERSON
LJ040-0204 WHO HAD REAL DIFFICULTY IN ACCEPTING AND RELATING TO PEOPLE END QUOTE AND WHO HAD QUOTE LITTLE UNDERSTANDING END QUOTE OF LEE'S BEHAVIOR
LJ040-0205 AND OF THE QUOTE PROTECTIVE SHELL HE HAS DRAWN AROUND HIMSELF END QUOTE. DR. HARTOGS REPORTED THAT MRS. OSWALD DID NOT UNDERSTAND
LJ040-0206 THAT LEE'S WITHDRAWAL WAS A FORM OF QUOTE VIOLENT BUT SILENT PROTEST AGAINST HIS NEGLECT BY HER
LJ040-0207 AND REPRESENTS HIS REACTION TO A COMPLETE ABSENCE OF ANY REAL FAMILY LIFE END QUOTE
LJ040-0208 CARRO REPORTED THAT WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT HIS MOTHER LEE SAID QUOTE
LJ040-0209 WELL I'VE GOT TO LIVE WITH HER. I GUESS I LOVE HER END QUOTE
LJ040-0210 IT MAY ALSO BE SIGNIFICANT THAT AS REPORTED BY JOHN PIC QUOTE LEE SLEPT WITH MY MOTHER UNTIL I JOINED THE SERVICE IN NINETEEN FIFTY
LJ040-0211 THIS WOULD MAKE HIM APPROXIMATELY 10 WELL ALMOST 11 YEARS OLD. END QUOTE
LJ040-0212 THE FACTORS IN LEE OSWALD'S PERSONALITY WHICH WERE NOTED BY THOSE WHO HAD CONTACT WITH HIM IN NEW YORK INDICATE
LJ040-0213 THAT HE HAD GREAT DIFFICULTY IN ADAPTING HIMSELF TO CONDITIONS IN THAT CITY
LJ040-0214 HIS USUAL REACTION TO THE PROBLEMS WHICH HE ENCOUNTERED THERE WAS SIMPLY WITHDRAWAL
LJ040-0215 THOSE FACTORS INDICATED A SEVERE INABILITY TO ENTER INTO RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER PEOPLE
LJ040-0216 IN VIEW OF HIS EXPERIENCES WHEN HE VISITED HIS RELATIVES IN NEW ORLEANS IN THE SPRING OF NINETEEN FIFTY AND HIS OTHER SOLITARY HABITS
LJ040-0217 LEE HAD APPARENTLY BEEN EXPERIENCING SIMILAR PROBLEMS BEFORE GOING TO NEW YORK
LJ040-0218 AND AS WILL BE SHOWN BELOW THIS FAILURE TO ADAPT TO HIS ENVIRONMENT WAS A DOMINANT TRAIT IN HIS LATER LIFE
LJ040-0219 IT WOULD BE INCORRECT HOWEVER TO BELIEVE THAT THOSE ASPECTS OF LEE'S PERSONALITY WHICH WERE OBSERVED IN NEW YORK
LJ040-0220 COULD HAVE LED ANYONE TO PREDICT THE OUTBURST OF VIOLENCE WHICH FINALLY OCCURRED
LJ040-0221 CARRO WAS THE ONLY ONE OF OSWALD'S THREE PRINCIPAL OBSERVERS WHO RECOMMENDED THAT HE BE PLACED IN A BOY'S HOME OR SIMILAR INSTITUTION
LJ040-0222 BUT CARRO WAS QUITE SPECIFIC THAT HIS RECOMMENDATION WAS BASED PRIMARILY ON THE ADVERSE FACTORS IN LEE'S ENVIRONMENT
LJ040-0223 HIS LACK OF FRIENDS THE APPARENT UNAVAILABILITY OF ANY AGENCY ASSISTANCE AND THE INEFFECTUALNESS OF HIS MOTHER
LJ040-0224 AND NOT ON ANY PARTICULAR MENTAL DISTURBANCE IN THE BOY HIMSELF
LJ040-0225 CARRO TESTIFIED THAT QUOTE THERE WAS NOTHING THAT WOULD LEAD ME TO BELIEVE WHEN I SAW HIM AT THE AGE OF 12 THAT THEM WOULD BE SEEDS OF DESTRUCTION FOR SOMEBODY
LJ040-0226 I COULDN'T IN ALL HONESTY SINCERELY SAY SUCH A THING
LJ040-0227 MRS. SIEGEL CONCLUDED HER REPORT WITH THE STATEMENT THAT QUOTE
LJ040-0228 DESPITE HIS WITHDRAWAL HE GIVES THE IMPRESSION THAT HE IS NOT SO DIFFICULT TO REACH AS HE APPEARS AND PATIENT PROLONGED EFFORT
LJ040-0229 IN A SUSTAINED RELATIONSHIP WITH ONE THERAPIST MIGHT BRING RESULTS
LJ040-0230 THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT HE HAS SUFFERED SERIOUS PERSONALITY DAMAGE BUT IF HE CAN RECEIVE HELP QUICKLY THIS MIGHT BE REPAIRED TO SOME EXTENT END QUOTE
LJ040-0231 LEE OSWALD NEVER RECEIVED THAT HELP
LJ040-0232 FEW SOCIAL AGENCIES EVEN IN NEW YORK WERE EQUIPPED TO PROVIDE THE KIND OF INTENSIVE TREATMENT THAT HE NEEDED
LJ040-0233 AND WHEN ONE OF THE CITY'S CLINICS DID FIND ROOM TO HANDLE HIM
LJ040-0234 FOR SOME REASON THE RECORD DOES NOT SHOW ADVANTAGE WAS NEVER TAKEN OF THE CHANCE AFFORDED TO OSWALD
LJ040-0235 WHEN LEE BECAME A DISCIPLINARY PROBLEM UPON HIS RETURN TO SCHOOL IN THE FALL OF NINETEEN FIFTY THREE
LJ040-0236 AND WHEN HIS MOTHER FAILED TO COOPERATE IN ANY WAY WITH SCHOOL AUTHORITIES
LJ040-0237 AUTHORITIES WERE FINALLY FORCED TO CONSIDER PLACEMENT IN A HOME FOR BOYS
LJ040-0238 SUCH A PLACEMENT WAS POSTPONED HOWEVER PERHAPS IN PART AT LEAST BECAUSE LEE'S BEHAVIOR SUDDENLY IMPROVED
LJ040-0239 BEFORE THE COURT TOOK ANY ACTION THE OSWALDS LEFT NEW YORK IN JANUARY OF NINETEEN FIFTY FOUR
LJ040-0240 AND RETURNED TO NEW ORLEANS WHERE LEE FINISHED THE NINTH GRADE BEFORE HE LEFT SCHOOL TO WORK FOR A YEAR
LJ041-0001 REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION ON THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY. THE WARREN COMMISSION REPORT. BY THE PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION ON THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY
LJ041-0002 CHAPTER 7. LEE HARVEY OSWALD BACKGROUND AND POSSIBLE MOTIVES PART 2
LJ041-0003 RETURN TO NEW ORLEANS AND JOINING THE MARINE CORPS
LJ041-0004 AFTER HIS RETURN TO NEW ORLEANS OSWALD WAS TEASED AT SCHOOL BECAUSE OF THE NORTHERN ACCENT WHICH HE HAD ACQUIRED
LJ041-0005 HE CONCLUDED THAT SCHOOL HAD NOTHING TO OFFER HIM
LJ041-0006 HIS MOTHER EXERCISED LITTLE CONTROL OVER HIM AND THOUGHT HE COULD DECIDE FOR HIMSELF WHETHER TO GO ON IN SCHOOL
LJ041-0007 NEIGHBORS AND OTHERS WHO KNEW HIM AT THAT TIME RECALL AN INTROVERTED BOY WHO READ A GREAT DEAL
LJ041-0008 HE TOOK WALKS AND VISITED MUSEUMS AND SOMETIMES RODE A RENTED BICYCLE IN THE PARK ON SATURDAY MORNINGS
LJ041-0009 MRS. MURRET BELIEVES THAT HE TALKED AT LENGTH WITH A GIRL ON THE TELEPHONE BUT NO ONE REMEMBERS THAT HE HAD ANY DATES
LJ041-0010 A FRIEND EDWARD VOEBEL TESTIFIED THAT QUOTE HE WAS MORE BASHFUL ABOUT GIRLS THAN ANYTHING ELSE END QUOTE
LJ041-0011 SEVERAL WITNESSES TESTIFIED THAT LEE OSWALD WAS NOT AGGRESSIVE. HE WAS HOWEVER INVOLVED IN SOME FIGHTS
LJ041-0012 ONCE A GROUP OF WHITE BOYS BEAT HIM UP FOR SITTING IN THE NEGRO SECTION OF A BUS WHICH HE APPARENTLY DID SIMPLY OUT OF IGNORANCE
LJ041-0013 ANOTHER TIME HE FOUGHT WITH TWO BROTHERS WHO CLAIMED THAT HE HAD PICKED ON THE YOUNGER OF THEM 3 YEARS OSWALD'S JUNIOR
LJ041-0014 TWO DAYS LATER QUOTE SOME BIG GUY PROBABLY FROM A HIGH SCHOOL  HE LOOKED LIKE A TREMENDOUS FOOTBALL PLAYER END QUOTE
LJ041-0015 ACCOSTED OSWALD ON THE WAY HOME FROM SCHOOL AND PUNCHED HIM IN THE MOUTH MAKING HIS LIP BLEED AND LOOSENING A TOOTH
LJ041-0016 VOEBEL TOOK OSWALD BACK TO THE SCHOOL TO ATTEND TO HIS WOUNDS AND THEIR QUOTE MILD FRIENDSHIP END QUOTE STEMMED FROM THAT INCIDENT
LJ041-0017 VOEBEL ALSO RECALLED THAT OSWALD ONCE OUTLINED A PLAN TO CUT THE GLASS IN THE WINDOW OF A STORE ON RAMPART STREET AND STEAL A PISTOL
LJ041-0018 BUT HE WAS NOT SURE THEN THAT OSWALD MEANT TO CARRY OUT THE PLAN AND IN FACT THEY NEVER DID
LJ041-0019 VOEBEL SAID THAT OSWALD QUOTE WOULDN'T START ANY FIGHTS BUT IF YOU WANTED TO START ONE WITH HIM HE WAS GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT HE ENDED IT
LJ041-0020 OR YOU WERE GOING TO REALLY HAVE ONE BECAUSE HE WASN'T GOING TO TAKE ANYTHING FROM ANYBODY END QUOTE
LJ041-0021 IN A SPACE FOR THE NAMES OF QUOTE CLOSE FRIENDS END QUOTE ON THE NINTH GRADE PERSONAL HISTORY RECORD
LJ041-0022 OSWALD FIRST WROTE QUOTE EDWARD VOGEL END QUOTE AN OBVIOUS MISSPELLING OF VOEBEL'S NAME
LJ041-0023 AND QUOTE ARTHOR ABEAR END QUOTE MOST LIKELY ARTHUR HEBERT A CLASSMATE WHO HAS SAID THAT HE DID NOT KNOW OSWALD WELL
LJ041-0024 OSWALD ERASED THOSE NAMES HOWEVER AND INDICATED THAT HE HAD NO CLOSE FRIENDS
LJ041-0025 IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT THIS MISSPELLING OF NAMES APPARENTLY ON A PHONETIC BASIS WAS CAUSED BY A READINGSPELLING DISABILITY
LJ041-0026 FROM WHICH OSWALD APPEARED TO SUFFER
LJ041-0027 OTHER EVIDENCE OF THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH A DISABILITY IS PROVIDED BY THE MANY OTHER MISSPELLINGS THAT APPEAR IN OSWALD'S WRITINGS PORTIONS OF WHICH ARE QUOTED BELOW
LJ041-0028 SOMETIME DURING THIS PERIOD AND UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES TO BE DISCUSSED MORE FULLY BELOW
LJ041-0029 OSWALD STARTED TO READ COMMUNIST LITERATURE WHICH HE OBTAINED FROM THE PUBLIC LIBRARY
LJ041-0030 ONE OF HIS FELLOW EMPLOYEES PALMER MCBRIDE STATED THAT OSWALD SAID HE WOULD LIKE TO KILL PRESIDENT EISENHOWER BECAUSE HE WAS EXPLOITING THE WORKING CLASS
LJ041-0031 OSWALD PRAISED KHRUSHCHEV AND SUGGESTED THAT HE AND MCBRIDE JOIN THE COMMUNIST PARTY QUOTE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEIR SOCIAL FUNCTIONS END QUOTE
LJ041-0032 OSWALD ALSO BECAME INTERESTED IN THE NEW ORLEANS AMATEUR ASTRONOMY ASSOCIATION AN ORGANIZATION OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS
LJ041-0033 THE ASSOCIATION'S THEN PRESIDENT WILLIAM E. WULF TESTIFIED THAT HE REMEMBERED AN OCCASION WHEN OSWALD QUOTE
LJ041-0034 STARTED EXPOUNDING THE COMMUNIST DOCTRINE AND SAYING THAT HE WAS HIGHLY INTERESTED IN COMMUNISM THAT COMMUNISM WAS THE ONLY WAY OF LIFE FOR THE WORKER ET CETERA
LJ041-0035 AND THEN CAME OUT WITH A STATEMENT THAT HE WAS LOOKING FOR A COMMUNIST CELL IN TOWN TO JOIN BUT HE COULDN'T FIND ANY
LJ041-0036 HE WAS A LITTLE DISMAYED AT THIS AND HE SAID THAT HE COULDN'T FIND ANY THAT WOULD SHOW ANY INTEREST IN HIM AS A COMMUNIST
LJ041-0037 AND SUBSEQUENTLY AFTER THIS CONVERSATION MY FATHER CAME IN AND WE WERE KIND OF ARGUING BACK AND FORTH ABOUT THE SITUATION AND MY FATHER CAME IN THE ROOM
LJ041-0038 HEARD WHAT WE WERE ARGUING ON COMMUNISM AND THAT THIS BOY WAS LOUDMOUTHED BOISTEROUS AND MY FATHER ASKED HIM TO LEAVE THE HOUSE AND POLITELY PUT HIM OUT OF THE HOUSE
LJ041-0039 AND THAT IS THE LAST I HAVE SEEN OR SPOKEN WITH OSWALD END QUOTE
LJ041-0040 DESPITE THIS APPARENT INTEREST IN COMMUNISM OSWALD TRIED TO JOIN THE MARINES WHEN HE WAS SITEEN YEARS OLD
LJ041-0041 THIS WAS 1 YEAR BEFORE HIS ACTUAL ENLISTMENT AND JUST A LITTLE OVER 2.5 YEARS AFTER HE LEFT NEW YORK
LJ041-0042 HE WROTE A NOTE IN HIS MOTHER'S NAME TO SCHOOL AUTHORITIES IN NEW ORLEANS SAYING THAT HE WAS LEAVING SCHOOL BECAUSE HE AND HIS MOTHER WERE MOVING TO SAN DIEGO
LJ041-0043 IN FACT HE HAD QUIT SCHOOL IN AN ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN HIS MOTHER'S ASSISTANCE TO JOIN THE MARINES
LJ041-0044 WHILE HE APPARENTLY WAS ABLE TO INDUCE HIS MOTHER TO MAKE A FALSE STATEMENT ABOUT HIS AGE
LJ041-0045 HE WAS NEVERTHELESS UNABLE TO CONVINCE THE PROPER AUTHORITIES THAT HE WAS REALLY SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD
LJ041-0046 THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT OSWALD WAS GREATLY INFLUENCED IN HIS DECISION TO JOIN THE MARINES BY THE FACT THAT HIS BROTHER ROBERT HAD DONE SO
LJ041-0047 APPROXIMATELY 3 YEARS BEFORE. ROBERT OSWALD HAD GIVEN HIS MARINE CORPS MANUAL TO HIS BROTHER LEE
LJ041-0048 WHO STUDIED IT DURING THE YEAR FOLLOWING HIS UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO ENLIST UNTIL QUOTE HE KNEW IT BY HEART END QUOTE
LJ041-0049 ACCORDING TO MARGUERITE OSWALD QUOTE LEE LIVED FOR THE TIME THAT HE WOULD BECOME SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD TO JOIN THE MARINES  THAT WHOLE YEAR END QUOTE
LJ041-0050 IN JOHN PIC'S VIEW
LJ041-0051 OSWALD WAS MOTIVATED TO JOIN THE MARINES IN LARGE PART BY A DESIRE QUOTE TO GET FROM OUT AND UNDER THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION FROM MY MOTHER END QUOTE
LJ041-0052 OSWALD'S INABILITY OR LACK OF DESIRE TO ENTER INTO MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER PEOPLE
LJ041-0053 CONTINUED DURING THIS PERIOD IN NEW ORLEANS NINETEEN FIFTY FOUR TO NINETEEN FIFTY SIX
LJ041-0054 IT PROBABLY CONTRIBUTED GREATLY TO THE GENERAL DISSATISFACTION WHICH HE EXHIBITED WITH HIS ENVIRONMENT
LJ041-0055 A DISSATISFACTION WHICH SEEMED TO FIND EXPRESSION AT THIS PARTICULAR POINT
LJ041-0056 IN HIS INTENSE DESIRE TO JOIN THE MARINES AND GET AWAY FROM HIS SURROUNDINGS AND HIS MOTHER
LJ041-0057 HIS STUDY OF COMMUNIST LITERATURE
LJ041-0058 WHICH MIGHT APPEAR TO BE INCONSISTENT WITH HIS DESIRE TO JOIN THE MARINES COULD HAVE BEEN ANOTHER MANIFESTATION OF OSWALD'S REJECTION OF HIS ENVIRONMENT
LJ041-0059 HIS DIFFICULTY IN RELATING TO OTHER PEOPLE AND HIS GENERAL DISSATISFACTION WITH THE WORLD AROUND HIM CONTINUED WHILE HE WAS IN THE MARINE CORPS
LJ041-0060 KERRY THORNLEY A MARINE ASSOCIATE
LJ041-0061 WHO SHORTLY AFTER OSWALD'S DEFECTION WROTE AN AS YET UNPUBLISHED NOVEL BASED IN CONSIDERABLE PART ON OSWALD'S LIFE
LJ041-0062 TESTIFIED THAT QUOTE DEFINITELY THE MARINE CORPS WAS NOT WHAT HE HAD EXPECTED IT TO BE WHEN HE JOINED END QUOTE
LJ041-0063 HE SAID THAT OSWALD QUOTE SEEMED TO GUARD AGAINST DEVELOPING REAL CLOSE FRIENDSHIPS END QUOTE
LJ041-0064 DANIEL POWERS ANOTHER MARINE WHO WAS STATIONED WITH OSWALD FOR PART OF HIS MARINE CAREER
LJ041-0065 TESTIFIED THAT OSWALD SEEMED QUOTE ALWAYS TO BE STRIVING FOR A RELATIONSHIP BUT WHENEVER HE DID
LJ041-0066 HIS GENERAL PERSONALITY WOULD ALIENATE THE GROUP AGAINST HIM END QUOTE
LJ041-0067 OTHER MARINES ALSO TESTIFIED THAT OSWALD HAD FEW FRIENDS AND KEPT VERY MUCH TO HIMSELF
LJ041-0068 WHILE THERE IS NOTHING IN OSWALD'S MILITARY RECORDS TO INDICATE THAT HE WAS MENTALLY UNSTABLE OR OTHERWISE PSYCHOLOGICALLY UNFIT FOR DUTY IN THE MARINE CORPS
LJ041-0069 HE DID NOT ADJUST WELL TO CONDITIONS WHICH HE FOUND IN THAT SERVICE
LJ041-0070 HE DID NOT RISE ABOVE THE RANK OF PRIVATE FIRST CLASS EVEN THOUGH HE HAD PASSED A QUALIFYING EXAMINATION FOR THE RANK OF CORPORAL
LJ041-0071 HIS MARINE CAREER WAS NOT HELPED BY HIS ATTITUDE
LJ041-0072 THAT HE WAS A MAN OF GREAT ABILITY AND INTELLIGENCE AND THAT MANY OF HIS SUPERIORS IN THE MARINE CORPS WERE NOT SUFFICIENTLY COMPETENT TO GIVE HIM ORDERS
LJ041-0073 WHILE OSWALD DID NOT SEEM TO OBJECT TO AUTHORITY IN THE ABSTRACT HE DID THINK THAT HE SHOULD BE THE ONE TO EXERCISE IT
LJ041-0074 JOHN E. DONOVAN ONE OF HIS FORMER OFFICERS TESTIFIED THAT OSWALD THOUGHT QUOTE
LJ041-0075 THAT AUTHORITY PARTICULARLY THE MARINE CORPS OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE TALENT SUCH AS HIS OWN WITHOUT A GIVEN MAGIC COLLEGE DEGREE
LJ041-0076 AND PUT THEM IN POSITIONS OF PROMINENCE END QUOTE. OSWALD MANIFESTED THIS FEELING ABOUT AUTHORITY BY BAITING HIS OFFICERS
LJ041-0077 HE LED THEM INTO DISCUSSIONS OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS ABOUT WHICH THEY OFTEN KNEW LESS THAN HE DID SINCE HE HAD APPARENTLY DEVOTED CONSIDERABLE TIME TO A STUDY OF SUCH MATTERS
LJ041-0078 WHEN THE OFFICERS WERE UNABLE TO DISCUSS FOREIGN AFFAIRS SATISFACTORILY WITH HIM OSWALD REGARDED THEM AS UNFIT TO EXERCISE COMMAND OVER HIM
LJ041-0079 NELSON DELGADO ONE OF OSWALD'S FELLOW MARINES TESTIFIED THAT OSWALD TRIED TO QUOTE CUT UP ANYBODY THAT WAS HIGH RANKING END QUOTE
LJ041-0080 IN THOSE ARGUMENTS QUOTE AND MAKE HIMSELF COME OUT TOP DOG END QUOTE
LJ041-0081 OSWALD PROBABLY ENGAGED HIS SUPERIORS IN ARGUMENTS ON A SUBJECT THAT HE HAD STUDIED
LJ041-0082 IN AN ATTEMPT TO ATTRACT ATTENTION TO HIMSELF AND TO SUPPORT HIS EXAGGERATED IDEA OF HIS OWN ABILITIES
LJ041-0083 THORNLEY ALSO TESTIFIED THAT HE THOUGHT THAT OSWALD'S EXTREME PERSONAL SLOPPINESS IN THE MARINE CORPS QUOTE
LJ041-0084 FITTED INTO A GENERAL PERSONALITY PATTERN OF HIS TO DO WHATEVER WAS NOT WANTED OF HIM A RECALCITRANT TREND IN HIS PERSONALITY END QUOTE
LJ041-0085 OSWALD QUOTE SEEMED TO BE A PERSON WHO WOULD GO OUT OF HIS WAY TO GET INTO TROUBLE END QUOTE
LJ041-0086 AND THEN USED THE QUOTE SPECIAL TREATMENT END QUOTE HE RECEIVED AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE WAY IN WHICH HE WAS BEING PICKED ON AND QUOTE
LJ041-0087 AS A MEANS OF GETTING OR ATTEMPTING TO GET SYMPATHY END QUOTE. IN THORNLEY'S VIEW OSWALD LABORED UNDER A PERSECUTION COMPLEX
LJ041-0088 WHICH HE STROVE TO MAINTAIN AND QUOTE FELT THE MARINE CORPS KEPT A PRETTY CLOSE WATCH ON HIM BECAUSE OF HIS SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES END QUOTE
LJ041-0089 THORNLEY ADDED QUOTE I THINK IT WAS KIND OF NECESSARY TO HIM TO BELIEVE THAT HE WAS BEING PICKED ON
LJ041-0090 IT WASN'T ANYTHING EXTREME. I WOULDN'T GO AS FAR AS TO CALL IT CALL HIM A PARANOID BUT A DEFINITE TENDENCY THERE WAS IN THAT DIRECTION I THINK END QUOTE
LJ041-0091 POWERS CONSIDERED OSWALD TO BE MEEK AND EASILY LED
LJ041-0092 AN QUOTE INDIVIDUAL THAT YOU WOULD BRAINWASH AND QUITE EASY BUT I THINK ONCE HE BELIEVED IN SOMETHING HE STOOD IN HIS BELIEFS END QUOTE
LJ041-0093 POWERS ALSO TESTIFIED THAT OSWALD WAS RESERVED AND SEEMED TO BE QUOTE SOMEWHAT THE FRAIL LITTLE PUPPY IN THE LITTER END QUOTE
LJ041-0094 HE HAD THE NICKNAME QUOTE OZZIE RABBIT END QUOTE
LJ041-0095 OSWALD READ A GOOD DEAL SAID POWERS BUT QUOTE HE WOULD NEVER BE READING ANY OF THE SHOOTEMUP WESTERNS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
LJ041-0096 NORMALLY IT WOULD BE A GOOD TYPE OF LITERATURE AND THE ONE THAT I RECALL WAS LEAVES OF GRASS BY WALT WHITMAN END QUOTE
LJ041-0097 ACCORDING TO POWERS OSWALD SAID QUOTE
LJ041-0098 ALL THE MARINE CORPS DID WAS TO TEACH YOU TO KILL AND AFTER YOU GOT OUT OF THE MARINES YOU MIGHT BE GOOD GANGSTERS END QUOTE
LJ041-0099 POWERS BELIEVED THAT WHEN OSWALD ARRIVED IN JAPAN HE ACQUIRED A GIRLFRIEND QUOTE
LJ041-0100 FINALLY ATTAINING A MALE STATUS OR IMAGE IN HIS OWN EYES END QUOTE. THAT APPARENTLY CAUSED OSWALD TO BECOME MORE SELFCONFIDENT
LJ041-0101 AGGRESSIVE AND EVEN SOMEWHAT PUGNACIOUS ALTHOUGH POWERS QUOTE WOULDN'T SAY THAT THIS GUY IS A TROUBLEMAKER END QUOTE
LJ041-0102 POWERS SAID QUOTE NOW HE WAS OSWALD THE MAN RATHER THAN OSWALD THE RABBIT END QUOTE
LJ041-0103 OSWALD ONCE TOLD POWERS THAT HE DIDN'T CARE IF HE RETURNED TO THE UNITED STATES AT ALL
LJ041-0104 WHILE IN JAPAN OSWALD'S NEW FOUND APPARENT SELF CONFIDENCE AND PUGNACIOUSNESS
LJ041-0105 LED TO AN INCIDENT IN WHICH HE SPILLED A DRINK ON ONE OF HIS SERGEANTS AND ABUSIVELY CHALLENGED HIM TO FIGHT
LJ041-0106 AT THE COURTMARTIAL HEARING WHICH FOLLOWED OSWALD ADMITTED THAT HE HAD BEEN RATHER DRUNK WHEN THE INCIDENT OCCURRED
LJ041-0107 HE TESTIFIED THAT HE HAD FELT THE SERGEANT HAD A GRUDGE AGAINST HIM AND THAT HE HAD UNSUCCESSFULLY SOUGHT A TRANSFER FROM THE SERGEANT'S UNIT
LJ041-0108 HE SAID THAT HE HAD SIMPLY WANTED TO DISCUSS THE QUESTION WITH THE SERGEANT AND THE DRINK HAD BEEN SPILLED ACCIDENTALLY
LJ041-0109 THE HEARING OFFICER AGREED WITH THE LATTER CLAIM BUT FOUND OSWALD GUILTY OF WRONGFULLY USING PROVOKING WORDS AND SENTENCED HIM TO 28 DAYS
LJ041-0110 CANCELING THE SUSPENSION OF A 20DAY SENTENCE THAT OSWALD HAD RECEIVED IN AN EARLIER COURTMARTIAL
LJ041-0111 FOR POSSESSING AN UNAUTHORIZED PISTOL WITH WHICH HE HAD ACCIDENTALLY SHOT HIMSELF
LJ041-0112 AT HIS OWN REQUEST
LJ041-0113 OSWALD WAS TRANSFERRED FROM ACTIVE DUTY TO THE MARINE CORPS RESERVE UNDER HONORABLE CONDITIONS IN SEPTEMBER OF NINETEEN FIFTY NINE
LJ041-0114 3 MONTHS PRIOR TO HIS REGULARLY SCHEDULED SEPARATION DATE OSTENSIBLY TO CARE FOR HIS MOTHER WHO HAD BEEN INJURED IN AN ACCIDENT AT HER WORK
LJ041-0115 HE WAS UNDESIRABLY DISCHARGED FROM THE MARINE CORPS RESERVE TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN ASSIGNED ON INACTIVE STATUS FOLLOWING HIS TRANSFER FROM ACTIVE DUTY
LJ041-0116 AFTER IT WAS LEARNED THAT HE HAD DEFECTED TO THE SOVIET UNION
LJ041-0117 IN AN ATTEMPT TO HAVE THIS DISCHARGE REVERSED
LJ041-0118 OSWALD WROTE TO THEN SECRETARY OF THE NAVY CONNALLY ON JANUARY 30 NINETEEN SIXTY TWO
LJ041-0119 STATING THAT HE WOULD QUOTE EMPLOY ALL MEANS TO RIGHT THIS GROSS MISTAKE OR INJUSTICE END QUOTE
LJ041-0120 GOVERNOR CONNALLY HAD JUST RESIGNED TO RUN FOR GOVERNOR OF TEXAS SO HE ADVISED OSWALD THAT HE HAD FORWARDED THE LETTER TO HIS SUCCESSOR
LJ041-0121 IT IS THUS CLEAR THAT OSWALD KNEW THAT GOVERNOR CONNALLY WAS NEVER DIRECTLY CONCERNED WITH HIS DISCHARGE
LJ041-0122 AND HE MUST HAVE KNOWN THAT PRESIDENT KENNEDY HAD HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT
LJ041-0123 IN THAT CONNECTION IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT OSWALD EVER EXPRESSED ANY DISSATISFACTION OF ANY KIND WITH EITHER THE PRESIDENT OR GOVERNOR CONNALLY
LJ041-0124 MARINA OSWALD TESTIFIED THAT SHE QUOTE HAD NEVER HEARD ANYTHING BAD ABOUT KENNEDY FROM LEE. AND HE NEVER HAD ANYTHING AGAINST HIM END QUOTE
LJ041-0125 MRS. OSWALD SAID THAT HER HUSBAND DID NOT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT GOVERNOR CONNALLY AFTER HIS RETURN TO THE UNITED STATES. SHE TESTIFIED QUOTE
LJ041-0126 BUT WHILE WE WERE IN RUSSIA HE SPOKE WELL OF HIM. LEE SAID THAT WHEN HE WOULD RETURN TO THE UNITED STATES HE WOULD VOTE FOR HIM FOR GOVERNOR END QUOTE
LJ041-0127 OSWALD MUST HAVE ALREADY LEARNED THAT THE GOVERNOR COULD NOT HELP HIM WITH HIS DISCHARGE BECAUSE HE WAS NO LONGER SECRETARY OF THE NAVY AT THE TIME HE MADE THAT REMARK
LJ041-0128 EVEN THOUGH OSWALD APPARENTLY DID NOT EXPRESS ANY HOSTILITY AGAINST THE PRESIDENT OR GOVERNOR CONNALLY
LJ041-0129 HE CONTINUED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT HIS UNDESIRABLE DISCHARGE. IT IS CLEAR THAT HE THOUGHT HE HAD BEEN UNJUSTLY TREATED
LJ041-0130 PROBABLY HIS COMPLAINT WAS DUE TO THE FACT THAT HIS DISCHARGE WAS NOT RELATED TO ANYTHING HE HAD DONE WHILE ON ACTIVE DUTY
LJ041-0131 AND ALSO BECAUSE HE HAD NOT RECEIVED ANY NOTICE OF THE ORIGINAL DISCHARGE PROCEEDINGS SINCE HIS WHEREABOUTS WERE NOT KNOWN
LJ041-0132 HE CONTINUED HIS EFFORTS TO REVERSE THE DISCHARGE BY PETITIONING THE NAVY DISCHARGE REVIEW BOARD
LJ041-0133 WHICH FINALLY DECLINED TO MODIFY THE DISCHARGE AND SO ADVISED HIM IN A LETTER DATED JULY NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ041-0134 GOVERNOR CONNALLY'S CONNECTION WITH THE DISCHARGE ALTHOUGH INDIRECT CAUSED THE COMMISSION TO CONSIDER WHETHER HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN OSWALD'S REAL TARGET
LJ041-0135 IN THAT CONNECTION IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT MARINA OSWALD TESTIFIED ON SEPTEMBER 6 NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR THAT SHE THOUGHT HER HUSBAND QUOTE
LJ041-0136 WAS SHOOTING AT CONNALLY RATHER THAN PRESIDENT KENNEDY END QUOTE
LJ041-0137 IN SUPPORT OF HER CONCLUSION MRS. OSWALD NOTED HER HUSBAND'S UNDESIRABLE DISCHARGE
LJ041-0138 AND THAT SHE COULD NOT THINK OF ANY REASON WHY OSWALD WOULD WANT TO KILL PRESIDENT KENNEDY
LJ041-0139 IT SHOULD BE NOTED HOWEVER THAT AT THE TIME OSWALD FIRED THE SHOTS AT THE PRESIDENTIAL LIMOUSINE THE GOVERNOR OCCUPIED THE SEAT IN FRONT OF THE PRESIDENT
LJ041-0140 AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR OSWALD TO HAVE HIT THE GOVERNOR WITHOUT HITTING THE PRESIDENT FIRST
LJ041-0141 OSWALD COULD HAVE SHOT THE GOVERNOR AS THE CAR APPROACHED THE DEPOSITORY OR AS IT WAS MAKING THE TURN ONTO ELM STREET
LJ041-0142 ONCE IT HAD STARTED DOWN ELM STREET TOWARD THE TRIPLE UNDERPASS HOWEVER
LJ041-0143 THE PRESIDENT ALMOST COMPLETELY BLOCKED OSWALD'S VIEW OF THE GOVERNOR PRIOR TO THE TIME THE FIRST SHOT STRUCK THE PRESIDENT
LJ041-0144 OSWALD WOULD HAVE HAD OTHER AND MORE FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITIES TO STRIKE AT THE GOVERNOR THAN ON THIS OCCASION WHEN AS A MEMBER OF THE PRESIDENT'S PARTY
LJ041-0145 HE HAD MORE PROTECTION THAN USUAL. IT WOULD APPEAR THEREFORE THAT TO THE EXTENT OSWALD'S UNDESIRABLE DISCHARGE AFFECTED HIS MOTIVATION
LJ041-0146 IT WAS MORE IN TERMS OF A GENERAL HOSTILITY AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND ITS REPRESENTATIVES RATHER THAN A GRUDGE AGAINST ANY PARTICULAR PERSON
LJ041-0147 INTEREST IN MARXISM
LJ041-0148 AS INDICATED ABOVE OSWALD STARTED TO READ COMMUNIST LITERATURE AFTER HE AND HIS MOTHER LEFT NEW YORK AND MOVED TO NEW ORLEANS
LJ041-0149 HE TOLD ALINE MOSBY A REPORTER WHO INTERVIEWED HIM AFTER HE ARRIVED IN MOSCOW QUOTE
LJ041-0150 I'M A MARXIST. I BECAME INTERESTED ABOUT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN FROM AN IDEOLOGICAL VIEWPOINT
LJ041-0151 AN OLD LADY HANDED ME A PAMPHLET ABOUT SAVING THE ROSENBERGS I LOOKED AT THAT PAPER AND I STILL REMEMBER IT FOR SOME REASON I DON'T KNOW WHY. END QUOTE
LJ041-0152 OSWALD STUDIED MARXISM AFTER HE JOINED THE MARINES AND HIS SYMPATHIES IN THAT DIRECTION AND FOR THE SOVIET UNION APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN WIDELY KNOWN
LJ041-0153 AT LEAST IN THE UNIT TO WHICH HE WAS ASSIGNED AFTER HIS RETURN FROM THE FAR EAST
LJ041-0154 HIS INTEREST IN RUSSIA LED SOME OF HIS ASSOCIATES TO CALL HIM COMRADE OR OSWALDSKOVITCH
LJ041-0155 HE ALWAYS WANTED TO PLAY THE RED PIECES IN CHESS BECAUSE AS HE SAID IN AN APPARENTLY HUMOROUS CONTEXT
LJ041-0156 HE PREFERRED THE QUOTE RED ARMY END QUOTE
LJ041-0157 HE STUDIED THE RUSSIAN LANGUAGE READ A RUSSIAN LANGUAGE NEWSPAPER AND SEEMED INTERESTED IN WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE SOVIET UNION
LJ041-0158 THORNLEY WHO THOUGHT OSWALD HAD AN IRREVOCABLE CONVICTION THAT HIS MARXIST BELIEFS WERE CORRECT TESTIFIED QUOTE
LJ041-0159 I THINK YOU COULD SIT DOWN AND ARGUE WITH HIM FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND I DON'T THINK YOU COULD HAVE CHANGED HIS MIND ON THAT UNLESS YOU KNEW WHY HE BELIEVED IT IN THE FIRST PLACE
LJ041-0160 I CERTAINLY DON'T. I DON'T THINK WITH ANY KIND OF FORMAL ARGUMENT YOU COULD HAVE SHAKEN THAT CONVICTION. AND THAT IS WHY I SAY IRREVOCABLE
LJ041-0161 IT WAS JUST  NEVER GETTING BACK TO LOOKING AT THINGS FROM ANY OTHER WAY ONCE HE HAD BECOME A MARXIST WHENEVER THAT WAS END QUOTE
LJ041-0162 THORNLEY ALSO TESTIFIED ABOUT AN INCIDENT WHICH GREW
LJ041-0163 OUT OF A COMBINATION OF OSWALD'S KNOWN MARXIST SYMPATHIES AND GEORGE ORWELL'S BOOK 1984 ONE OF OSWALD'S FAVORITE BOOKS
LJ041-0164 WHICH THORNLEY READ AT OSWALD'S SUGGESTION
LJ041-0165 SHORTLY AFTER THORNLEY FINISHED READING THAT BOOK THE MARINE UNIT TO WHICH BOTH MEN WERE ASSIGNED WAS REQUIRED TO TAKE PART IN A SATURDAY MORNING PARADE
LJ041-0166 IN HONOR OF SOME RETIRING NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS AN EVENT WHICH THEY BOTH APPROACHED WITH LITTLE ENTHUSIASM
LJ041-0167 WHILE WAITING FOR THE PARADE TO START THEY TALKED BRIEFLY ABOUT 1984
LJ041-0168 EVEN THOUGH OSWALD SEEMED TO BE LOST IN HIS OWN THOUGHTS. AFTER A BRIEF PERIOD OF SILENCE OSWALD REMARKED ON THE STUPIDITY OF THE PARADE
LJ041-0169 AND ON HOW ANGRY IT MADE HIM TO WHICH THORNLEY REPLIED QUOTE WELL COMES THE REVOLUTION YOU WILL CHANGE ALL THAT END QUOTE
LJ041-0170 THORNLEY TESTIFIED QUOTE AT WHICH TIME HE LOOKED AT ME LIKE A BETRAYED CAESAR AND SCREAMED SCREAMED DEFINITELY NOT YOU TOO THORNLEY
LJ041-0171 AND I REMEMBER HIS VOICE CRACKED AS HE SAID THIS. HE WAS DEFINITELY DISTURBED AT WHAT I HAD SAID AND I DIDN'T REALLY THINK I HAD SAID THAT MUCH
LJ041-0172 I NEVER SAID ANYTHING TO HIM AGAIN AND HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING TO ME AGAIN END QUOTE
LJ041-0173 THORNLEY SAID THAT HE HAD MADE HIS REMARK ONLY IN THE CONTEXT OF 1984
LJ041-0174 AND HAD NOT INTENDED ANY CRITICISM OF OSWALD'S POLITICAL VIEWS WHICH IS THE WAY IN WHICH THORNLEY THOUGHT OSWALD TOOK HIS REMARKS
LJ041-0175 LIEUTENANT DONOVAN TESTIFIED THAT OSWALD THOUGHT THAT QUOTE THERE WERE MANY GRAVE INJUSTICES CONCERNING THE AFFAIRS IN THE INTERNATIONAL SITUATION END QUOTE
LJ041-0176 HE RECALLED THAT OSWALD HAD A SPECIFIC INTEREST IN LATIN AMERICA PARTICULARLY CUBA
LJ041-0177 AND EXPRESSED OPPOSITION TO THE BATISTA REGIME AND SYMPATHY FOR CASTRO AN ATTITUDE WHICH DONOVAN SAID WAS QUOTE
LJ041-0178 NOT UNPOPULAR END QUOTE AT THAT TIME. DONOVAN TESTIFIED
LJ041-0179 THAT HE NEVER HEARD OSWALD EXPRESS A DESIRE PERSONALLY TO TAKE PART IN THE ELIMINATION OF INJUSTICES ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD AND THAT HE QUOTE
LJ041-0180 NEVER HEARD HIM IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM CONFESS THAT HE WAS A COMMUNIST OR THAT HE EVER THOUGHT ABOUT BEING A COMMUNIST END QUOTE
LJ041-0181 DELGADO TESTIFIED THAT OSWALD WAS QUOTE A COMPLETE BELIEVER THAT OUR WAY OF GOVERNMENT WAS NOT QUITE RIGHT END QUOTE
LJ041-0182 AND BELIEVED THAT OUR GOVERNMENT DID NOT HAVE QUOTE TOO MUCH TO OFFER END QUOTE BUT WAS NOT IN FAVOR OF QUOTE THE COMMUNIST WAY OF LIFE END QUOTE
LJ041-0183 DELGADO AND OSWALD TALKED MORE ABOUT CUBA THAN RUSSIA AND SOMETIMES IMAGINED THEMSELVES AS LEADERS IN THE CUBAN ARMY OR GOVERNMENT
LJ041-0184 WHO MIGHT QUOTE LEAD AN EXPEDITION TO SOME OF THESE OTHER ISLANDS AND FREE THEM TOO END QUOTE
LJ041-0185 THORNLEY ALSO BELIEVED THAT OSWALD'S MARXIST BELIEFS LED TO AN EXTRAORDINARY VIEW OF HISTORY UNDER WHICH QUOTE HE LOOKED UPON THE EYES OF FUTURE PEOPLE
LJ041-0186 AS SOME KIND OF TRIBUNAL
LJ041-0187 AND HE WANTED TO BE ON THE WINNING SIDE SO THAT 10000 YEARS FROMNOW PEOPLE WOULD LOOK IN THE HISTORY BOOKS AND SAY WELL THIS MAN WAS AHEAD OF HIS TIME
LJ041-0188 THE EYES OF THE FUTURE BECAME THE EYES OF GOD
LJ041-0189 HE WAS CONCERNED WITH HIS IMAGE IN HISTORY AND I DO THINK THAT IS WHY HE CHOSE THE PARTICULAR METHOD OF DEFECTING HE CHOSE AND DID IT IN THE WAY HE DID
LJ041-0190 IT GOT HIM IN THE NEWSPAPERS. IT DID BROADCAST HIS NAME OUT END QUOTE
LJ041-0191 THORNLEY THOUGHT THAT OSWALD NOT ONLY WANTED A PLACE IN HISTORY BUT ALSO WANTED TO LIVE COMFORTABLY IN THE PRESENT
LJ041-0192 HE TESTIFIED THAT IF OSWALD COULD NOT HAVE THAT QUOTE DEGREE OF PHYSICAL COMFORT THAT HE EXPECTED OR SOUGHT
LJ041-0193 I THINK HE WOULD THEN THROW HIMSELF ENTIRELY ON THE OTHER THING HE ALSO WANTED WHICH WAS THE IMAGE IN HISTORY
LJ041-0194 I THINK HE WANTED BOTH IF HE COULD HAVE THEM. IF HE DIDN'T HE WANTED TO DIE WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT OR WITH THE IDEA THAT HE WAS SOMEBODY END QUOTE
LJ041-0195 OSWALD'S INTEREST IN MARXISM LED SOME PEOPLE TO AVOID HIM
LJ041-0196 EVEN THOUGH AS HIS WIFE SUGGESTED THAT INTEREST MAY HAVE BEEN MOTIVATED BY A DESIRE TO GAIN ATTENTION. HE USED HIS MARXIST AND ASSOCIATED ACTIVITIES
LJ041-0197 AS EXCUSES FOR HIS DIFFICULTIES IN GETTING ALONG IN THE WORLD WHICH WERE USUALLY CAUSED BY ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FACTORS
LJ041-0198 HIS USE OF THOSE EXCUSES TO PRESENT HIMSELF TO THE WORLD AS A PERSON WHO WAS BEING UNFAIRLY TREATED
LJ041-0199 IS SHOWN MOST CLEARLY BY HIS EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS AFTER HIS RETURN FROM THE SOVIET UNION. OF COURSE HE MADE HIS REAL PROBLEMS WORSE TO THE EXTENT
LJ041-0200 THAT HIS USE OF THOSE EXCUSES PREVENTED HIM FROM DISCOVERING THE REAL REASONS FOR AND ATTEMPTING TO OVERCOME HIS DIFFICULTIES
LJ041-0201 OF GREATER IMPORTANCE
LJ041-0202 OSWALD'S COMMITMENT TO MARXISM CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECISIONS WHICH LED HIM TO DEFECT TO THE SOVIET UNION IN NINETEEN FIFTY NINE AND LATER
LJ041-0203 TO ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES ON BEHALF OF THE FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE IN THE SUMMER OF NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ042-0001 REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION ON THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY
LJ042-0002 THE WARREN COMMISSION REPORT. BY THE PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION ON THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY. CHAPTER 7. LEE HARVEY OSWALD
LJ042-0003 BACKGROUND AND POSSIBLE MOTIVES PART 3
LJ042-0004 DEFECTION TO THE SOVIET UNION
LJ042-0005 AFTER OSWALD LEFT THE MARINE CORPS IN SEPTEMBER OF NINETEEN FIFTY NINE OSTENSIBLY TO CARE FOR HIS MOTHER
LJ042-0006 HE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY LEFT FOR THE SOVIET UNION WHERE HE ATTEMPTED TO RENOUNCE HIS CITIZENSHIP
LJ042-0007 AT THE AGE OF NINETEEN OSWALD THUS COMMITTED AN ACT WHICH WAS THE MOST STRIKING INDICATION HE HAD YET GIVEN
LJ042-0008 OF HIS WILLINGNESS TO ACT ON HIS BELIEFS IN QUITE EXTRAORDINARY WAYS
LJ042-0009 WHILE HIS DEFECTION RESULTED IN PART FROM OSWALD'S COMMITMENT TO MARXISM
LJ042-0010 IT APPEARS THAT PERSONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS WERE ALSO INVOLVED
LJ042-0011 ON AUGUST SEVENTEEN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE OSWALD TOLD MR. WILLIAM STUCKEY
LJ042-0012 WHO HAD ARRANGED A RADIO DEBATE ON OSWALD'S ACTIVITIES ON BEHALF OF THE FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE
LJ042-0013 THAT WHILE HE HAD BEGUN TO READ MARX AND ENGELS AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN THE CONCLUSIVE THING THAT MADE HIM DECIDE THAT MARXISM WAS THE ANSWER
LJ042-0014 WAS HIS SERVICE IN JAPAN
LJ042-0015 HE SAID LIVING CONDITIONS OVER THERE CONVINCED HIM SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH THE SYSTEM AND THAT POSSIBLY MARXISM WAS THE ANSWER
LJ042-0016 HE SAID IT WAS IN JAPAN THAT HE MADE UP HIS MIND TO GO TO RUSSIA
LJ042-0017 AND SEE FOR HIMSELF HOW A REVOLUTIONARY SOCIETY OPERATES A MARXIST SOCIETY
LJ042-0018 ON THE OTHER HAND AT LEAST ONE PERSON WHO KNEW OSWALD AFTER HIS RETURN THOUGHT THAT HIS DEFECTION HAD A MORE PERSONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL BASIS
LJ042-0019 THE VALIDITY OF THE LATTER OBSERVATION IS BORNE OUT BY SOME OF THE THINGS OSWALD WROTE IN CONNECTION WITH HIS DEFECTION
LJ042-0020 INDICATING THAT HIS MOTIVATION WAS AT LEAST IN PART A PERSONAL ONE. ON NOVEMBER 26 NINETEEN FIFTY NINE
LJ042-0021 SHORTLY AFTER HE ARRIVED IN THE SOVIET UNION AND PROBABLY BEFORE SOVIET AUTHORITIES HAD GIVEN HIM PERMISSION TO STAY INDEFINITELY
LJ042-0022 HE WROTE TO HIS BROTHER ROBERT THAT THE SOVIET UNION WAS A COUNTRY WHICH QUOTE I HAVE ALWAYS CONSIDERED TO BE MY OWN END QUOTE
LJ042-0023 AND THAT HE WENT THERE QUOTE ONLY TO FIND FREEDOM. I COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN PERSONALLY HAPPY IN THE U.S. END QUOTE
LJ042-0024 HE WROTE IN ANOTHER LETTER THAT HE WOULD QUOTE NEVER RETURN TO THE UNITED STATES WHICH IS A COUNTRY I HATE END QUOTE
LJ042-0025 HIS IDEA THAT HE WAS TO FIND QUOTE FREEDOM END QUOTE IN THE SOVIET UNION WAS TO BE RUDELY SHATTERED
LJ042-0026 WHATEVER OSWALD'S REASONS FOR GOING TO THE SOVIET UNION MIGHT HAVE BEEN HOWEVER THERE CAN BE LITTLE DOUBT THAT HIS DESIRE TO GO WAS QUITE STRONG
LJ042-0027 IN ADDITION TO STUDYING THE RUSSIAN LANGUAGE WHILE HE WAS IN THE MARINES
LJ042-0028 OSWALD HAD MANAGED TO SAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO COVER THE EXPENSES OF HIS FORTHCOMING TRIP
LJ042-0029 WHILE THERE IS NO PROOF THAT HE SAVED $1500 AS HE CLAIMED
LJ042-0030 IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN CONSIDERABLE DISCIPLINE TO SAVE WHATEVER AMOUNT WAS REQUIRED TO FINANCE HIS DEFECTION OUT OF THE SALARY OF A LOW RANKING ENLISTED MAN
LJ042-0031 THE EXTENT OF OSWALD'S DESIRE TO GO TO THE SOVIET UNION
LJ042-0032 AND OF HIS INITIAL COMMITMENT TO THAT COUNTRY CAN BEST BE UNDERSTOOD HOWEVER IN THE CONTEXT
LJ042-0033 OF HIS CONCOMITANT HATRED OF THE UNITED STATES WHICH WAS MOST CLEARLY EXPRESSED IN HIS NOVEMBER 26
LJ042-0035 AND COMMUNIST'S WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE PRESENT CAPITALIST GOVERNMENT OF THE U.S. OVERTHROWN END QUOTE OSWALD STATED
LJ042-0036 THAT THAT GOVERNMENT SUPPORTED AN ECONOMIC SYSTEM QUOTE WHICH EXPLOITS ALL ITS WORKERS END QUOTE
LJ042-0037 AND UNDER WHICH QUOTE ART CULTURE AND THE SPRIT OF MAN ARE SUBJECTED TO COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISING
LJ042-0038 AND RELIGION AND EDUCATION ARE USED AS A TOOL TO SUPPRESS WHAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE A POPULATION QUESTIONING THEIR GOVERNMENT'S UNFAIR
LJ042-0039 ECONOMIC SYSTEM AND PLANS FOR WAR END QUOTE
LJ042-0040 HE COMPLAINED IN HIS LETTER ABOUT SEGREGATION
LJ042-0041 UNEMPLOYMENT AUTOMATION AND THE USE OF MILITARY FORCES TO SUPPRESS OTHER POPULATIONS
LJ042-0042 ASKING HIS BROTHER WHY HE SUPPORTED THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT AND WHAT IDEALS HE PUT FORWARD OSWALD WROTE QUOTE
LJ042-0043 ASK ME AND I WILL TELL YOU I FIGHT FOR COMMUNISM
LJ042-0044 I WILL NOT SAY YOUR GRANDCHILDREN WILL LIVE UNDER COMMUNISM LOOK FOR YOURSELF AT HISTORY LOOK AT A WORLD MAP AMERICA IS A DICING COUNTRY
LJ042-0045 I DO NOT WISH TO BE A PART OF IT NOR DO I EVER AGAIN WISH TO BE USED AS A TOOL IN ITS MILITARY AGGRESSIONS
LJ042-0046 THIS SHOULD ANSWER YOUR QUESTION AND ALSO GIVE YOU A GLIMPSE OF MY WAY OF THINKING. SO YOU SPEAK OF ADVANTAGES. DO YOU THINK THAT IS WHY I AM HERE
LJ042-0047 FOR PERSONAL MATERIAL ADVANTAGES HAPPINESS IS NOT BASED ON ONESELF IT DOES NOT CONSIST OF A SMALL HOME OF TAKING AND GETTING
LJ042-0048 HAPPINESS IS TAKING PART IN THE STRUGGLE WHERE THERE IS NO BORDERLINE BETWEEN ONE'S OWN PERSONAL WORLD AND THE WORLD IN GENERAL
LJ042-0049 I NEVER BELIEVED I WOULD FIND MORE MATERIAL ADVANTAGES AT THIS STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOVIET UNION THAN I MIGHT OF HAD IN THE U.S
LJ042-0050 I HAVE BEEN A PROCOMMUNIST FOR YEARS AND YET I HAVE NEVER MET A COMMUNIST INSTEAD I KEPT SILENT AND OBSERVED
LJ042-0051 AND WHAT I OBSERVED PLUS MY MARXIST LEARNING BROUGHT ME HERE TO THE SOVIET UNION
LJ042-0052 I HAVE ALWAYS CONSIDERED THIS COUNTRY TO BE MY OWN. END QUOTE
LJ042-0053 RESPONDING TO ROBERT'S STATEMENT THAT HE HAD NOT RENOUNCED HIM
LJ042-0054 OSWALD TOLD HIS BROTHER QUOTE ON WHAT TERMS I WANT THIS ARRANGEMENT END QUOTE. HE ADVISED ROBERT THAT 1
LJ042-0055 IN THE EVENT OF WAR I WOULD KILL ANY AMERICAN WHO PUT A UNIFORM ON IN DEFENSE OF THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT  ANY AMERICAN
LJ042-0056 2. THAT IN MY OWN MIND I HAVE NO ATTACHMENTS OF ANY KIND IN THE U.S
LJ042-0057 3. THAT I WANT TO AND I SHALL LIVE A NORMAL HAPPY AND PEACEFUL LIFE HERE IN THE SOVIET UNION FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE
LJ042-0058 THAT MY MOTHER AND YOU ARE IN SPITE OF WHAT THE NEWSPAPER SAID NOT OBJECTS OF AFFECTION BUT ONLY EXAMPLES OF WORKERS IN THE U.S
LJ042-0059 DESPITE THIS COMMITMENT TO THE SOVIET UNION
LJ042-0060 OSWALD MET DISAPPOINTMENTS THERE JUST AS HE HAD IN THE PAST. AT THE OUTSET THE SOVIETS TOLD HIM THAT HE COULD NOT REMAIN
LJ042-0061 IT SEEMS THAT OSWALD IMMEDIATELY ATTEMPTED SUICIDE  A STRIKING INDICATION OF HOW MUCH HE DESIRED TO REMAIN IN THE SOVIET UNION
LJ042-0062 IT SHOWS HOW WILLING HE WAS TO ACT DRAMATICALLY AND DECISIVELY WHEN HE FACED AN EMOTIONAL CRISIS
LJ042-0063 WITH FEW READILY AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVES AT HAND. HE WAS SHOCKED TO FIND THAT THE SOVIET UNION DID NOT ACCEPT HIM WITH OPEN ARMS
LJ042-0064 THE ENTRY IN HIS SELFSTYLED QUOTE HISTORIC DIARY END QUOTE FOR OCTOBER 21 NINETEEN FIFTY NINE REPORTS QUOTE
LJ042-0065 I AM SHOCKED MY DREAMS I HAVE WAITED FOR 2 YEARS TO BE ACCEPTED
LJ042-0066 MY FONDEST DREAMS ARE SHATTERED BECAUSE OF A PETTY OFFICIAL. I DECIDE TO END IT
LJ042-0067 SOAK FIST IN COLD WATER TO NUMB THE PAIN THEN SLASH MY LEFT WRIST. THAN PLUNGE WRIST INTO BATHTUB OF HOT WATER
LJ042-0068 SOMEWHERE A VIOLIN PLAYS AS I WATCH MY LIFE WHIRL AWAY
LJ042-0069 I THINK TO MYSELF HOW EASY TO DIE AND A SWEET DEATH TO VIOLINS END QUOTE
LJ042-0070 OSWALD WAS DISCOVERED IN TIME TO THWART HIS ATTEMPT AT SUICIDE
LJ042-0071 HE WAS TAKEN TO A HOSPITAL IN MOSCOW WHERE HE WAS KEPT UNTIL OCTOBER 28 NINETEEN FIFTY NINE
LJ042-0072 STILL INTENT HOWEVER ON STAYING IN THE SOVIET UNION
LJ042-0073 OSWALD WENT ON OCTOBER 31 TO THE AMERICAN EMBASSY TO RENOUNCE HIS U.S. CITIZENSHIP
LJ042-0074 MR. RICHARD E. SNYDER THEN SECOND SECRETARY AND SENIOR CONSULAR OFFICIAL AT THE EMBASSY
LJ042-0075 TESTIFIED THAT OSWALD WAS EXTREMELY SURE OF HIMSELF AND SEEMED QUOTE TO KNOW WHAT HIS MISSION WAS
LJ042-0076 HE TOOK CHARGE IN A SENSE OF THE CONVERSATION RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING END QUOTE. HE PRESENTED THE FOLLOWING SIGNED NOTE
LJ042-0077 QUOTE I LEE HARVEY OSWALD DO HEREBY REQUEST THAT MY PRESENT CITIZENSHIP IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA BE REVOKED
LJ042-0078 I HAVE ENTERED THE SOVIET UNION FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF APPLYING FOR CITIZENSHIP IN THE SOVIET UNION THROUGH THE MEANS OF NATURALIZATION
LJ042-0079 MY REQUEST FOR CITIZENSHIP IS NOW PENDING BEFORE THE SUPREME SOVIET OF THE U.S.S.R. I TAKE THESE STEPS FOR POLITICAL REASONS
LJ042-0080 MY REQUEST FOR THE REVOKING OF MY AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP
LJ042-0081 IS MADE ONLY AFTER THE LONGEST AND MOST SERIOUS CONSIDERATIONS. I AFFIRM THAT MY ALLEGIANCE IS TO THE UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS
LJ042-0082 END QUOTE. AS HIS QUOTE PRINCIPAL REASON END QUOTE FOR RENOUNCING HIS CITIZENSHIP
LJ042-0083 OSWALD STATED QUOTE I AM A MARXIST END QUOTE. HE ALSO ALLUDED TO HARDSHIPS ENDURED BY HIS MOTHER AS A WORKER
LJ042-0084 REFERRING TO THEM AS EXPERIENCES THAT HE DID NOT INTEND TO HAVE HIMSELF EVEN THOUGH HE STATED THAT HE HAD NEVER HELD A CIVILIAN JOB
LJ042-0085 HE SAID THAT HIS MARINE SERVICE IN OKINAWA AND ELSEWHERE HAD GIVEN HIM QUOTE A CHANCE TO OBSERVE AMERICAN IMPERIALISM END QUOTE
LJ042-0086 BUT HE ALSO DISPLAYED SOME SENSITIVITY AT NOT HAVING REACHED A HIGHER RANK IN THE MARINE CORPS
LJ042-0087 HE STATED THAT HE HAD VOLUNTEERED TO GIVE SOVIET OFFICIALS ANY INFORMATION THAT HE HAD CONCERNING MARINE CORPS OPERATIONS AND INTIMATED
LJ042-0088 THAT HE MIGHT KNOW SOMETHING OF SPECIAL INTEREST. OSWALD'S HISTORIC DIARY DESCRIBES THE EVENT IN PART AS FOLLOWS QUOTE
LJ042-0089 I LEAVE EMBASSY ELATED AT THIS SHOWDOWN RETURNING TO MY HOTEL I FEEL NOW MY ENERGIES ARE NOT SPENT IN VAIN
LJ042-0090 I'M SURE RUSSIANS WILL ACCEPT ME AFTER THIS SIGN OF MY FAITH IN THEM END QUOTE
LJ042-0091 THE SOVIET AUTHORITIES FINALLY PERMITTED OSWALD TO REMAIN IN THEIR COUNTRY
LJ042-0092 NO EVIDENCE HAS BEEN FOUND THAT THEY USED HIM FOR ANY PARTICULAR PROPAGANDA OR OTHER POLITICAL OR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES
LJ042-0093 THEY SENT HIM TO MINSK TO WORK IN A RADIO AND TELEVISION FACTORY AS A METAL WORKER
LJ042-0094 THE SOVIET AUTHORITIES DENIED OSWALD PERMISSION
LJ042-0095 TO ATTEND A UNIVERSITY IN MOSCOW BUT THEY GAVE HIM A MONTHLY ALLOWANCE OF 700 RUBLES A MONTH
LJ042-0096 OLD EXCHANGE RATE IN ADDITION TO HIS FACTORY SALARY OF APPROXIMATELY EQUAL AMOUNT
LJ042-0097 AND CONSIDERABLY BETTER LIVING QUARTERS THAN THOSE ACCORDED TO SOVIET CITIZENS OF EQUAL AGE AND STATION
LJ042-0098 THE SUBSIDY APPARENTLY SIMILAR TO THOSE SOMETIMES GIVEN TO FOREIGNERS ALLOWED TO REMAIN IN THE SOVIET UNION TOGETHER WITH HIS SALARY
LJ042-0099 GAVE OSWALD AN INCOME WHICH HE SAID APPROXIMATED THAT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE FACTORY IN WHICH HE WORKED
LJ042-0100 EVEN THOUGH HE RECEIVED MORE MONEY AND BETTER LIVING QUARTERS THAN OTHER RUSSIANS DOING SIMILAR WORK
LJ042-0101 HE ENVIED HIS WIFE'S UNCLE A COLONEL IN THE MVD BECAUSE OF THE LARGER APARTMENT IN WHICH HE LIVED
LJ042-0102 REMINISCENT OF HIS ATTITUDE TOWARD HIS SUPERIORS IN THE MARINE CORPS
LJ042-0103 OSWALD APPARENTLY RESENTED THE EXERCISE OF AUTHORITY OVER HIM AND THE BETTER TREATMENT AFFORDED TO COMMUNIST PARTY OFFICIALS
LJ042-0104 AFTER HE RETURNED TO THE UNITED STATES
LJ042-0105 HE TOOK THE POSITION THAT THE COMMUNIST PARTY OFFICIALS IN THE SOVIET UNION WERE OPPORTUNISTS WHO WERE BETRAYING THEIR POSITIONS FOR PERSONAL GAIN
LJ042-0106 HE IS REPORTED TO HAVE EXPRESSED THE CONCLUSION THAT THEY HAD QUOTE FAT STINKING POLITICIANS OVER THERE JUST LIKE WE HAVE OVER HERE END QUOTE
LJ042-0107 OSWALD APPARENTLY CONTINUED TO HAVE PERSONAL DIFFICULTIES WHILE HE WAS IN MINSK
LJ042-0108 ALTHOUGH MARINA OSWALD TOLD THE COMMISSION THAT HER HUSBAND HAD GOOD PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS IN THE SOVIET UNION KATHERINE FORD
LJ042-0109 ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE RUSSIAN COMMUNITY IN DALLAS WITH WHICH THE OSWALDS BECAME ACQUAINTED UPON THEIR ARRIVAL IN THE UNITED STATES
LJ042-0110 STATED THAT MRS. OSWALD TOLD HER EVERYBODY IN RUSSIA QUOTE HATED HIM END QUOTE
LJ042-0111 JEANNE DE MOHRENSCHILDT ANOTHER MEMBER OF THAT GROUP
LJ042-0112 SAID THAT OSWALD TOLD HER THAT HE HAD RETURNED BECAUSE QUOTE I DIDN'T FIND WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR END QUOTE
LJ042-0113 GEORGE DE MOHRENSCHILDT THOUGHT THAT OSWALD MUST HAVE BECOME DISGUSTED WITH LIFE IN THE SOVIET UNION AS THE NOVELTY
LJ042-0114 OF THE PRESENCE OF AN AMERICAN WORE OFF AND HE BEGAN TO BE LESS THE CENTER OF ATTENTION
LJ042-0115 THE BEST DESCRIPTION OF OSWALD'S STATE OF MIND HOWEVER IS SET FORTH IN HIS OWN HISTORIC DIARY
LJ042-0116 UNDER THE ENTRY FOR MAY 1 NINETEEN SIXTY
LJ042-0117 HE NOTED THAT ONE OF HIS ACQUAINTANCES QUOTE RELATES MANY THINGS I DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THE U.S.S.R.
LJ042-0118 I BEGIN TO FEEL UNEASY INSIDE ITS TRUE END QUOTE
LJ042-0119 UNDER THE ENTRY FOR AUGUST TO SEPTEMBER OF THAT YEAR HE WROTE QUOTE
LJ042-0120 AS MY RUSSIAN IMPROVES I BECOME INCREASINGLY CONSCIOUS OF JUST WHAT SORT OF A SOCIETY I LIVE IN
LJ042-0121 MASS GYMNASTICS COMPULSORY AFTERWORK MEETING USUALLY POLITICAL INFORMATION MEETING
LJ042-0122 COMPULSORY ATTENDANCE AT LECTURES AND THE SENDING OF THE ENTIRE SHOP COLLECTIVE EXCEPT ME TO PICK POTATOES ON A SUNDAY AT A STATE COLLECTIVE FARM
LJ042-0123 A PATRIOTIC DUTY TO BRING IN THE HARVEST. THE OPINIONS OF THE WORKERS UNVOICED ARE THAT IT'S A GREAT PAIN IN THE NECK
LJ042-0124 THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE ESPECIALLY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT ANY OF THE COLLECTIVE DUTIES A NATURAL FEELING
LJ042-0125 I AM INCREASINGLY AWARE OF THE PRESENCE IN ALL THING OF LEBIZEN SHOP PARTY SECRETARY FAT FORTYISH AND JOVIAL ON THE OUTSIDE
LJ042-0126 HE IS A NONONSENSE PARTY REGULAR
LJ042-0127 FINALLY THE ENTRY OF JANUARY 4 TO 31 OF NINETEEN SIXTY ONE QUOTE
LJ042-0128 I AM STATING TO RECONSIDER MY DESIRE ABOUT STAYING THE WORK IS DRAB. THE MONEY I GET HAS NOWHERE TO BE SPENT
LJ042-0129 NO NIGHT CLUBS OR BOWLING ALLEYS NO PLACES OF RECREATION EXCEPT THE TRADE UNION DANCES. I HAVE HAD ENOUGH
LJ042-0130 SHORTLY THEREAFTER LESS THAN 18 MONTHS AFTER HIS DEFECTION ABOUT SIX WEEKS BEFORE HE MET MARINA PRUSAKOVA
LJ042-0131 OSWALD OPENED NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE U.S. EMBASSY IN MOSCOW LOOKING TOWARD HIS RETURN TO THE UNITED STATES
LJ042-0132 RETURN TO THE UNITED STATES. IN VIEW OF THE INTENSITY OF HIS EARLIER COMMITMENT TO THE SOVIET UNION
LJ042-0133 A GREAT CHANGE MUST HAVE OCCURRED IN OSWALD'S THINKING TO INDUCE HIM TO RETURN TO THE UNITED STATES
LJ042-0134 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF THAT CHANGE MUST HAVE BEEN HIGHLY UNSETTLING. IT SHOULD BE REMEMBERED
LJ042-0135 THAT HE WAS NOT YET 20 YEARS OLD WHEN HE WENT TO THE SOVIET UNION WITH SUCH HIGH HOPES AND NOT QUITE 23 WHEN HE RETURNED BITTERLY DISAPPOINTED
LJ042-0136 HIS ATTEMPT TO RENOUNCE HIS CITIZENSHIP HAD BEEN AN OPEN EXPRESSION OF HOSTILITY AGAINST THE UNITED STATES AND A PROFOUND REJECTION OF HIS EARLY LIFE
LJ042-0137 THE DRAMATIC BREAK WITH SOCIETY IN AMERICA NOW HAD TO BE UNDONE
LJ042-0138 HIS RETURN TO THE UNITED STATES PUBLICLY TESTIFIED TO THE UTTER FAILURE OF WHAT HAD BEEN THE MOST IMPORTANT ACT OF HIS LIFE
LJ042-0139 MARINA OSWALD CONFIRMED THE FACT THAT HER HUSBAND WAS EXPERIENCING PSYCHOLOGICAL DIFFICULTIES AT THE TIME OF HIS RETURN
LJ042-0140 SHE SAID THAT QUOTE IMMEDIATELY AFTER COMING TO THE UNITED STATES LEE CHANGED. I DID NOT KNOW HIM AS SUCH A MAN IN RUSSIA END QUOTE
LJ042-0141 SHE ADDED THAT WHILE HE HELPED HER AS HE HAD DONE BEFORE HE BECAME MORE OF A RECLUSE THAT QUOTE
LJ042-0142 HE WAS VERY IRRITABLE SOMETIMES FOR A TRIFLE END QUOTE AND THAT QUOTE LEE WAS VERY UNRESTRAINED AND VERY EXPLOSIVE END QUOTE
LJ042-0143 DURING THE PERIOD FROM NOVEMBER 19 NINETEEN SIXTY TWO TO MARCH OF NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ042-0144 AFTER THE ASSASSINATION SHE WROTE THAT QUOTE
LJ042-0145 IN GENERAL OUR FAMILY LIFE BEGAN TO DETERIORATE AFTER WE ARRIVED IN AMERICA
LJ042-0146 LEE WAS ALWAYS HOTTEMPERED AND NOW THIS TRAIT OF CHARACTER MORE AND MORE PREVENTED US FROM LIVING TOGETHER IN HARMONY
LJ042-0147 LEE BECAME VERY IRRITABLE AND SOMETIMES SOME COMPLETELY TRIVIAL THING WOULD DRIVE HIM INTO A RAGE
LJ042-0148 I MYSELF DO NOT HAVE A PARTICULARLY QUIET DISPOSITION
LJ042-0149 BUT I HAD TO CHANGE MY CHARACTER A GREAT DEAL IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN A MORE OR LESS PEACEFUL FAMILY LIFE. END QUOTE
LJ042-0150 MARINA OSWALD'S JUDGMENT OF HER HUSBAND'S STATE OF MIND MAY BE SUBSTANTIATED BY COMPARING MATERIAL WHICH HE WROTE IN THE SOVIET UNION
LJ042-0151 WITH WHAT HE WROTE WHILE ON THE WAY BACK TO THE UNITED STATES AND AFTER HIS RETURN
LJ042-0152 WHILE IN THE SOVIET UNION HE WROTE HIS LONGEST AND CLEAREST PIECE OF WORK THE COLLECTIVE
LJ042-0153 THIS WAS A FAIRLY COHERENT DESCRIPTION OF LIFE IN THAT COUNTRY BASICALLY CENTERED AROUND THE RADIO AND TELEVISION FACTORY IN WHICH HE WORKED
LJ042-0154 WHILE IT WAS APPARENTLY INTENDED FOR PUBLICATION IN THE UNITED STATES AND IS IN MANY RESPECTS CRITICAL OF CERTAIN ASPECTS OF LIFE IN THE SOVIET UNION
LJ042-0155 IT APPEARS TO BE THE WORK OF A FAIRLY WELL ORGANIZED PERSON
LJ042-0156 OSWALD PREFACED HIS MANUSCRIPT WITH A SHORT AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH WHICH READS IN PART AS FOLLOWS QUOTE
LJ042-0157 LEE HARVEY OSWALD WAS BORN IN OCTOBER NINETEEN THIRTY NINE IN NEW ORLEANS LOUISIANA THE SON OF A INSURANCE SALESMEN WHOSE EARLY DEATH
LJ042-0158 LEFT A FAR MEAN STREAK OF INDEPENDENCE BROUGHT ON BY NEGLECT
LJ042-0159 ENTERING THE US MARINE CORP AT 17 THIS STREAK OF INDEPENDENCE WAS STRENGTHENED BY EXOTIC JOURNEYS TO JAPAN
LJ042-0160 THE PHILIPPINES AND THE SCORES OF ODD ISLANDS IN THE PACIFIC
LJ042-0161 IMMEDIATELY AFTER SERVING OUT HIS 3 YEARS IN THE U.S. MARINE CORPS HE ABANDONED HIS AMERICAN LIFE TO SEEK A NEW LIFE IN THE USSR
LJ042-0162 FULL OF OPTIMISM AND HOPE HE STOOD IN RED SQUARE IN THE FALL OF NINETEEN FIFTY NINE VOWING TO SEE HIS CHOSEN COURSE THROUGH
LJ042-0163 AFTER HOWEVER 2 YEARS AND A LOT OF GROWING UP I DECIDED TO RETURN TO THE USA
LJ042-0164 THE COLLECTIVE CONTRASTS SHARPLY WITH MATERIAL WHICH OSWALD SEEMS TO HAVE WRITTEN AFTER HE LEFT THE SOVIET UNION
LJ042-0165 WHICH APPEARS TO BE MORE AN EXPRESSION OF HIS OWN PSYCHOLOGICAL CONDITION THAN OF A REASONED ANALYSIS
LJ042-0166 THE LATTER MATERIAL EXPRESSES GREAT HOSTILITY TO BOTH COMMUNISM AND CAPITALISM. HE WROTE THAT TO A PERSON KNOWING BOTH OF THOSE SYSTEMS QUOTE
LJ042-0167 THERE CAN BE NO MEDIATION BETWEEN THOSE SYSTEMS AS THEY EXIST TODAY AND THAT PERSON
LJ042-0168 HE MUST BE OPPOSED TO THEIR BASIC FOUNDATIONS AND REPRESENTATIVES END QUOTE
LJ042-0169 AND YET IT IS IMMATURE TO TAKE THE SORT OF ATTITUDE WHICH SAYS QUOTE A CURSE ON BOTH YOUR HOUSES END QUOTE
LJ042-0170 THERE ARE TWO GREAT REPRESENTATIVES OF POWER IN THE WORLD
LJ042-0171 SIMPLY EXPRESSED THE LEFT AND RIGHT AND THEIR OFFSPRING FACTIONS AND CONCERNS. ANY PRACTICAL ATTEMPT AT ONE ALTERNATIVE
LJ042-0172 MUST HAVE AS ITS NUCLEUS THE TRADITIONAL IDEOLOGICAL BEST OF BOTH SYSTEMS AND YET BE UTTERLY OPPOSED TO BOTH SYSTEMS
LJ042-0173 SUCH AN ALTERNATIVE WAS TO BE OPPOSED BOTH TO CAPITALISM AND COMMUNISM BECAUSE QUOTE
LJ042-0174 NO MAN HAVING KNOWN HAVING LIVED UNDER THE RUSSIAN COMMUNIST AND AMERICAN CAPITALIST SYSTEM
LJ042-0175 COULD POSSIBLY MAKE A CHOICE BETWEEN THEM THERE IS NO CHOICE
LJ042-0176 ONE OFFERS OPPRESSION THE OTHER POVERTY. BOTH OFFER IMPERIALISTIC INJUSTICE TINTED WITH TWO BRANDS OF SLAVERY END QUOTE
LJ042-0177 OSWALD ACTUALLY DID ATTEMPT TO FORMULATE SUCH AN ALTERNATIVE WHICH HE PLANNED TO QUOTE PUT FORWARD END QUOTE HIMSELF
LJ042-0178 HE THOUGHT THE NEW ALTERNATIVE WOULD HAVE ITS BEST CHANCE TO BE ACCEPTED AFTER QUOTE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE TWO WORLD SYSTEMS LEAVES THE WORLD COUNTRY
LJ042-0179 WITHOUT DEFENSE OR FOUNDATION OF GOVERNMENT END QUOTE
LJ042-0180 AFTER WHICH THE SURVIVORS WOULD QUOTE SEEK AN ALTERNATIVE OPPOSED TO THOSE SYSTEMS WHICH HAVE BROUGHT THEM MISERY END QUOTE
LJ042-0181 OSWALD REALIZED THAT QUOTE THEIR THINKING AND EDUCATION WILL BE STEEPED IN THE TRADITIONS OF THOSE SYSTEMS
LJ042-0182 AND THEY WOULD NEVER ACCEPT A NEW ORDER COMPLETE BEYOND THEIR UNDERSTANDING END QUOTE
LJ042-0183 AS A RESULT HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE QUOTE NECESSARY TO OPPOSE THE OLD SYSTEMS BUT AT THE SAME TIME SUPPORT THEIR CHERISHED TRADITIONS END QUOTE
LJ042-0184 EXPANDING ON HIS IDEAS ON HOW HIS ALTERNATIVE TO COMMUNISM AND CAPITALISM MIGHT BE INTRODUCED HE WROTE OF A QUOTE READILY FORESEEABLE
LJ042-0185 ECONOMIC POLITICAL OR MILITARY CRISIS INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL
LJ042-0186 WHICH WILL BRING ABOUT THE FINAL DESTRUCTION OF THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM AND INDICATED THAT
LJ042-0187 PREPARATION IN A SPECIAL PARTY COULD SAFEGUARD AN INDEPENDENT COURSE OF ACTION AFTER THE DEBACLE END QUOTE
LJ042-0188 WHICH WOULD ACHIEVE THE GOAL WHICH WAS QUOTE THE EMPLACEMENT OF A SEPARATE DEMOCRATIC PURE COMMUNIST SOCIETY
LJ042-0189 BUT ONE WITH UNION COMMUNES
LJ042-0190 DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIZING OF PRODUCTION AND WITHOUT REGARD TO THE TWISTING APART OF MARXISM MARXIST COMMUNISM BY OTHER POWERS
LJ042-0191 WHILE QUOTE RESOURCEFULNESS AND PATIENT WORKING TOWARDS THE AFORESAID GOALS
LJ042-0192 ARE PREFERRED RATHER THAN LOUD AND USELESS MANIFESTATIONS OF PROTEST END QUOTE OSWALD WENT ON TO NOTE QUOTE
LJ042-0193 BUT THESE PREFERRED TACTICS NOW MAY PROVE TO BE TOO LIMITED IN THE NEAR FUTURE
LJ042-0194 THEY SHOULD NOT BE CONFUSED WITH SLOWNESS INDECISION OR FEAR. ONLY THE INTELLECTUALLY FEARLESS COULD EVEN BE REMOTELY ATTRACTED TO OUR DOCTRINE
LJ042-0195 AND YET THIS DOCTRINE REQUIRES THE UTMOST UTMOST RESTRAINT A STATE OF BEING IN ITSELF MAJESTIC IN POWER END QUOTE
LJ042-0196 OSWALD'S DECIDED REJECTION OF BOTH CAPITALISM AND COMMUNISM
LJ042-0197 SEEMED TO PLACE HIM IN A SITUATION IN WHICH HE COULD NOT LIVE WITH SATISFACTION EITHER IN THE UNITED STATES OR IN THE SOVIET UNION
LJ042-0198 THE DISCUSSION ABOVE HAS ALREADY SET FORTH EXAMPLES OF HIS EXPRESSION OF HATRED FOR THE UNITED STATES
LJ042-0199 HE ALSO EXPRESSED HATRED OF THE SOVIET UNION AND OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY U.S.A
LJ042-0200 EVEN THOUGH HE LATER REFERRED TO THE LATTER AS QUOTE TRUSTED LONG TIME FIGHTERS FOR PROGRESS END QUOTE
LJ042-0201 HE WROTE QUOTE THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF THE UNITED STATES HAS BETRAYED ITSELF
LJ042-0202 IT HAS TURNED ITSELF INTO THE TRADITIONAL LEVER OF A FOREIGN POWER TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES
LJ042-0203 NOT IN THE NAME OF FREEDOM OR HIGH IDEALS
LJ042-0204 BUT IN SERVILE CONFORMITY TO THE WISHES OF THE SOVIET UNION AND IN ANTICIPATION OF SOVIET RUSSIA'S COMPLETE DOMINATION OF THE AMERICAN CONTINENT
LJ042-0205 THERE CAN BE NO SYMPATHY FOR THOSE WHO HAVE TURNED THE IDEA OF COMMUNISM INTO A VILE CURSE TO WESTERN MAN
LJ042-0206 THE SOVIETS HAVE COMMITTED CRIMES UNSURPASSED EVEN BY THEIR EARLY DAY CAPITALIST COUNTERPARTS THE IMPRISONMENT OF THEIR OWN PEOPLES
LJ042-0207 WITH THE MASS EXTERMINATION SO TYPICAL OF STALIN AND THE INDIVIDUAL SUPPRESSION AND REGIMENTATION UNDER KHRUSHCHEV
LJ042-0208 THE DEPORTATIONS THE PURPOSEFUL CURTAILMENT OF DIET IN THE CONSUMER SLIGHTED POPULATION OF RUSSIA
LJ042-0209 THE MURDER OF HISTORY THE PROSTITUTION OF ART AND CULTURE END QUOTE
LJ042-0210 A SUGGESTION THAT OSWALD HATED MORE THAN JUST CAPITALISM AND COMMUNISM
LJ042-0211 IS PROVIDED BY THE FOLLOWING WHICH WAS APPARENTLY WRITTEN EITHER ON THE SHIP COMING BACK OR AFTER HIS RETURN FROM THE SOVIET UNION QUOTE
LJ042-0212 I HAVE OFTEN WONDERED WHY IT IS THAT THE COMMUNIST ANARCHIST CAPITALIST AND EVEN THE FASCIST AND ANARCHIST ELEMENTS IN AMERICAN
LJ042-0213 ALWAYS PROFESS PATRIOTISM TOWARD THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE IF NOT THE GOVERNMENT ALTHOUGH THEIR IDEALS MOVEMENTS MUST SURELY LEAD
LJ042-0214 TO THE BITTER DESTRUCTION OF ALL AND EVERYTHING. I AM QUITE SURE THESE PEOPLE MUST HATE NOT ONLY THE GOVERNMENT
LJ042-0215 BUT OUR THE PEOPLE CULTURE TRADITIONS HERITAGE AND VERY PEOPLE ITSELF AND YET
LJ042-0216 THEY STAND UP AND PIOUSLY PRONOUNCE THEMSELVES PATRIOTS DISPLAYING THEIR WAR MEDALS THAT THEY GAINED IN CONFLICTS LONG PAST BETWEEN THEMSELVES
LJ042-0217 I WONDER WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IT SOMEBODY WAS TO STAND UP AND SAY HE WAS UTTERLY OPPOSED NOT ONLY TO THE GOVERNMENTS BUT TO THE PEOPLE
LJ042-0218 TO THE ENTIRE LAND AND COMPLETE FOUNDATIONS OF HIS SOCIETY END QUOTE
LJ042-0219 OSWALD DEMONSTRATED HIS THINKING IN CONNECTION WITH HIS RETURN TO THE UNITED STATES BY PREPARING TWO SETS OF IDENTICAL QUESTIONS OF THE TYPE WHICH HE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT
LJ042-0220 HE WOULD BE ASKED AT A PRESS CONFERENCE WHEN HE RETURNED
LJ042-0221 WITH EITHER GREAT AMBIVALENCE OR COLD CALCULATION HE PREPARED COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ANSWERS TO THE SAME QUESTIONS
LJ042-0222 JUDGED BY HIS OTHER STATEMENTS AND WRITINGS HOWEVER HE APPEARS TO HAVE INDICATED HIS TRUE FEELINGS IN THE SET OF ANSWERS FIRST PRESENTED
LJ042-0223 AND TO HAVE STATED IN THE SECOND WHAT HE THOUGHT WOULD BE LEAST HARMFUL TO HIM AS HE RESUMED LIFE IN THE UNITED STATES
LJ042-0224 FOR EXAMPLE IN RESPONSE TO HIS QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS DECISION TO GO TO THE SOVIET UNION HIS FIRST DRAFT ANSWERED QUOTE
LJ042-0225 AS A MARK OF DISCUSS AND PROTEST AGAINST AMERICAN POLITICAL POLICIES IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES MY PERSONAL SIGN OF DISCONTENT
LJ042-0226 AND HORROR AT THE MISGUIDED LINE OF REASONING OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT END QUOTE
LJ042-0227 HIS SECOND ANSWER WAS THAT HE QUOTE WENT AS A CITIZEN OF THE U.S. AS A TOURIST RESIDING IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY WHICH I HAVE A PERFECT RIGHT TO DO
LJ042-0228 I WENT THERE TO SEE THE LAND THE PEOPLE AND HOW THEIR SYSTEM WORKS END QUOTE
LJ042-0229 TO THE QUESTION OF QUOTE ARE YOU A COMMUNIST END QUOTE HE FIRST ANSWERED YES
LJ042-0230 BASICALLY ALTHOUGH I HATE THE USSR AND SOCIALIST SYSTEM I STILL THINK MARXISM CAN WORK UNDER DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES END QUOTE
LJ042-0231 HIS SECOND ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WAS QUOTE NO OF COURSE NOT
LJ042-0232 I HAVE NEVER EVEN KNOW A COMMUNIST OUTSIDE OF THE ONES IN THE USSR BUT YOU CAN'T HELP THAT END QUOTE
LJ042-0233 HIS FIRST SET OF QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS INDICATED HIS BELIEF THAT THERE WERE NO OUTSTANDING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SOVIET UNION AND THE UNITED STATES
LJ042-0234 QUOTE EXCEPT IN THE US THE LIVING STANDARD IS A LITTLE HIGHER
LJ042-0235 FREEDOMS ARE ABOUT THE SAME. MEDICAL AID AND THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IN THE USSR IS BETTER THAN IN THE USA END QUOTE
LJ042-0236 IN THE SECOND SIMULATED TRANSCRIPT WHICH ENDED WITH THE STATEMENT QUOTE NEWSPAPERS THANK YOU SIR. YOU ARE A REAL PATRIOT END QUOTE
LJ042-0237 HE APPARENTLY CONCLUDED THAT THE UNITED STATES OFFERED QUOTE
LJ042-0238 FREEDOM OF SPEECH TRAVEL OUTSPOKEN OPPOSITION TO UNPOPULAR POLICIES FREEDOM TO BELIEVE IN GOD END QUOTE WHILE THE SOVIET UNION DID NOT
LJ042-0239 DESPITE THE HATRED THAT OSWALD EXPRESSED TOWARD THE SOVIET UNION AFTER HIS RESIDENCE THERE
LJ042-0240 HE CONTINUED TO BE INTERESTED IN THAT COUNTRY AFTER HE RETURNED TO THE UNITED STATES
LJ042-0241 SOON AFTER HIS ARRIVAL HE WROTE TO THE SOVIET EMBASSY IN WASHINGTON
LJ042-0242 REQUESTING INFORMATION ON HOW TO SUBSCRIBE TO RUSSIAN NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES AND ASKED FOR QUOTE
LJ042-0244 OSWALD SUBSEQUENTLY DID SUBSCRIBE TO SEVERAL SOVIET JOURNALS
LJ042-0245 WHILE MARINA OSWALD TRIED TO OBTAIN PERMISSION TO RETURN TO THE SOVIET UNION SHE TESTIFIED THAT SHE DID SO AT HER HUSBAND'S INSISTENCE
LJ042-0246 IN JULY OF NINETEEN SIXTY THREE OSWALD ALSO REQUESTED THE SOVIET UNION TO PROVIDE A VISA FOR HIS RETURN TO THAT COUNTRY
LJ042-0247 IN AUGUST OF NINETEEN SIXTY THREE HE GAVE THE NEW ORLEANS POLICE AS A REASON FOR REFUSING TO PERMIT HIS FAMILY TO LEARN ENGLISH
LJ042-0248 THAT QUOTE HE HATED AMERICA AND HE DID NOT WANT THEM TO BECOME AMERICANIZED AND THAT HIS PLANS WERE TO GO BACK TO RUSSIA END QUOTE
LJ042-0249 EVEN THOUGH HIS PRIMARY PURPOSE PROBABLY WAS TO GET TO CUBA
LJ042-0250 HE SOUGHT AN IMMEDIATE GRANT OF VISA ON HIS TRIP TO MEXICO CITY IN LATE SEPTEMBER OF NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ042-0251 HE ALSO INQUIRED ABOUT VISAS FOR HIMSELF AND HIS WIFE
LJ043-0001 REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION ON THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY
LJ043-0002 THE WARREN COMMISSION REPORT BY THE PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION ON THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY CHAPTER SEVEN LEE HARVEY OSWALD
LJ043-0003 BACKGROUND AND POSSIBLE MOTIVES PART FOUR
LJ043-0004 PERSONAL RELATIONS
LJ043-0005 APART FROM HIS RELATIVES OSWALD HAD NO FRIENDS OR CLOSE ASSOCIATES IN TEXAS WHEN HE RETURNED THERE IN JUNE OF NINETEEN SIXTY TWO
LJ043-0006 AND HE DID NOT ESTABLISH ANY CLOSE FRIENDSHIPS OR ASSOCIATIONS ALTHOUGH IT APPEARS THAT HE CAME TO RESPECT GEORGE DE MOHRENSCHILDT
LJ043-0007 SOMEWHAT OF A NONCONFORMIST
LJ043-0008 DE MOHRENSCHILDT WAS A PERIPHERAL MEMBER OF THE SOCALLED RUSSIAN COMMUNITY WITH WHICH OSWALD MADE CONTACT THROUGH MR. PETER GREGORY
LJ043-0009 A RUSSIANSPEAKING PETROLEUM ENGINEER WHOM OSWALD MET AS A RESULT OF HIS CONTACT WITH THE TEXAS EMPLOYMENT COMMISSION OFFICE IN FORT WORTH
LJ043-0010 SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF THAT GROUP SAW A GOOD DEAL OF THE OSWALDS THROUGH THE FALL OF NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ043-0011 AND ATTEMPTED TO HELP MRS. OSWALD PARTICULARLY IN VARIOUS WAYS. IN GENERAL OSWALD DID NOT LIKE THE MEMBERS OF THE RUSSIAN COMMUNITY
LJ043-0012 IN FACT HIS RELATIONS WITH SOME OF THEM PARTICULARLY GEORGE BOUHE BECAME QUITE HOSTILE
LJ043-0013 PART OF THE PROBLEM RESULTED FROM THE FACT THAT AS JEANNE DE MOHRENSCHILDT TESTIFIED
LJ043-0014 OSWALD WAS QUOTE VERY VERY DISAGREEABLE AND DISAPPOINTED END QUOTE
LJ043-0015 HE ALSO EXPRESSED CONSIDERABLE RESENTMENT AT THE HELP GIVEN TO HIS WIFE BY HER RUSSIANAMERICAN FRIENDS
LJ043-0016 JEANNE DE MOHRENSCHILDT SAID QUOTE
LJ043-0017 MARINA HAD A HUNDRED DRESSES GIVEN TO HER AND HE OBJECTED TO THAT LAVISH HELP BECAUSE MARINA WAS THROWING IT INTO HIS FACE
LJ043-0018 HE WAS OFFENSIVE WITH THE PEOPLE. AND I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY BECAUSE THAT HURT HIM
LJ043-0019 HE COULD NEVER GIVE HER WHAT THE PEOPLE WERE SHOWERING ON HER NO MATTER HOW HARD HE WORKED  AND HE WORKED VERY HARD END QUOTE
LJ043-0020 THE RELATIONS BETWEEN OSWALD AND HIS WIFE BECAME SUCH THAT BOUHE WANTED TO LIBERATE HER FROM OSWALD
LJ043-0021 WHILE THE EXACT SEQUENCE OF EVENTS IS NOT CLEAR BECAUSE OF CONFLICTING TESTIMONY
LJ043-0022 IT APPEARS THAT DE MOHRENSCHILDT AND HIS WIFE ACTUALLY WENT TO OSWALD'S APARTMENT EARLY IN NOVEMBER OF NINETEEN SIXTY TWO
LJ043-0023 AND HELPED TO MOVE THE PERSONAL EFFECTS OF MARINA OSWALD AND THE BABY
LJ043-0024 EVEN THOUGH IT APPEARS THAT THEY MAY HAVE LEFT OSWALD A FEW DAYS BEFORE IT SEEMS THAT HE RESISTED THE MOVE AS BEST HE COULD
LJ043-0025 HE EVEN THREATENED TO TEAR UP HIS WIFE'S DRESSES AND BREAK ALL THE BABY THINGS. ACCORDING TO DE MOHRENSCHILDT
LJ043-0026 OSWALD SUBMITTED TO THE INEVITABLE PRESUMABLY BECAUSE HE WAS QUOTE SMALL YOU KNOW AND HE WAS RATHER A PUNY INDIVIDUAL END QUOTE
LJ043-0027 DE MOHRENSCHILDT SAID THAT THE WHOLE AFFAIR MADE HIM NERVOUS SINCE HE WAS QUOTE INTERFERING IN OTHER PEOPLE'S AFFAIRS AFTER ALL END QUOTE
LJ043-0028 OSWALD ATTEMPTED TO GET HIS WIFE TO COME BACK AND OVER BOUHE'S PROTEST DE MOHRENSCHILDT FINALLY TOLD HIM WHERE SHE WAS
LJ043-0029 DE MOHRENSCHILDT ADMITTED THAT QUOTE
LJ043-0030 IF SOMEBODY DID THAT TO ME A LOUSY TRICK LIKE THAT TO TAKE MY WIFE AWAY AND ALL THE FURNITURE I WOULD BE MAD AS HELL TOO
LJ043-0031 I AM SURPRISED THAT HE DIDN'T DO SOMETHING WORSE END QUOTE
LJ043-0032 AFTER ABOUT A 2WEEK SEPARATION MARINA OSWALD RETURNED TO HER HUSBAND
LJ043-0033 BOUHE THOROUGHLY DISAPPROVED OF THIS AND AS A RESULT ALMOST ALL COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE OSWALDS AND MEMBERS OF THE RUSSIAN COMMUNITY CEASED
LJ043-0034 CONTACTS WITH DE MOHRENSCHILDT AND HIS WIFE DID CONTINUE AND THEY SAW THE OSWALDS OCCASIONALLY UNTIL THE SPRING OF NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ043-0035 SHORTLY AFTER HIS RETURN FROM THE SOVIET UNION OSWALD SEVERED ALL RELATIONS WITH HIS MOTHER
LJ043-0036 HE DID NOT SEE HIS BROTHER ROBERT FROM THANKSGIVING OF NINETEEN SIXTY TWO UNTIL NOVEMBER TWENTY THREE NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ043-0037 AT THE TIME OF HIS DEFECTION OSWALD HAD SAID THAT NEITHER HIS BROTHER ROBERT
LJ043-0038 NOR HIS MOTHER WERE OBJECTS OF HIS AFFECTION QUOTE BUT ONLY EXAMPLES OF WORKERS IN THE U.S. END QUOTE
LJ043-0039 HE ALSO INDICATED TO OFFICIALS AT THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN MOSCOW THAT HIS DEFECTION WAS MOTIVATED AT LEAST IN PART
LJ043-0040 BY SOCALLED EXPLOITATION OF HIS MOTHER BY THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM
LJ043-0041 CONSISTENT WITH THIS ATTITUDE
LJ043-0042 HE FIRST TOLD HIS WIFE THAT HE DID NOT HAVE A MOTHER BUT LATER ADMITTED THAT HE DID BUT THAT QUOTE HE DIDN'T LOVE HER VERY MUCH END QUOTE
LJ043-0043 WHEN THEY ARRIVED FROM THE SOVIET UNION OSWALD AND HIS FAMILY LIVED AT FIRST WITH HIS BROTHER ROBERT
LJ043-0044 THE LATTER TESTIFIED THAT THEY QUOTE WERE JUST TOGETHER AGAIN END QUOTE AS IF HIS BROTHER QUOTE HAD NOT BEEN TO RUSSIA END QUOTE
LJ043-0045 HE ALSO SAID THAT HE AND HIS FAMILY GOT ALONG WELL WITH MARINA OSWALD AND ENJOYED SHOWING HER AMERICAN THINGS
LJ043-0046 AFTER ABOUT A MONTH WITH HIS BROTHER
LJ043-0047 OSWALD AND HIS FAMILY LIVED FOR A BRIEF PERIOD WITH HIS MOTHER AT HER URGING BUT OSWALD SOON DECIDED TO MOVE OUT
LJ043-0048 MARGUERITE OSWALD VISITED HER SON AND HIS FAMILY AT THE FIRST APARTMENT WHICH HE RENTED AFTER HIS RETURN AND TRIED TO HELP THEM GET SETTLED THERE
LJ043-0049 AFTER SHE HAD BOUGHT SOME CLOTHES FOR MARINA OSWALD AND A HIGHCHAIR FOR THE BABY OSWALD EMPHATICALLY TOLD HER TO STOP
LJ043-0050 AS MARGUERITE OSWALD TESTIFIED QUOTE
LJ043-0051 HE STRONGLY PUT ME IN MY PLACE ABOUT BUYING THINGS FOR HIS WIFE THAT HE HIMSELF COULD NOT BUY END QUOTE
LJ043-0052 OSWALD OBJECTED TO HIS MOTHER VISITING THE APARTMENT
LJ043-0053 AND BECAME QUITE INCENSED WITH HIS WIFE WHEN SHE WOULD OPEN THE DOOR FOR HER IN SPITE OF HIS INSTRUCTIONS TO THE CONTRARY
LJ043-0054 OSWALD MOVED TO DALLAS ON ABOUT OCTOBER 8 NINETEEN SIXTY TWO WITHOUT TELLING HIS MOTHER WHERE HE WAS GOING
LJ043-0055 HE NEVER SAW OR COMMUNICATED WITH HER IN ANY WAY AGAIN UNTIL SHE CAME TO SEE HIM AFTER THE ASSASSINATION
LJ043-0056 EVEN THOUGH OSWALD CUT OFF RELATIONS WITH HIS MOTHER
LJ043-0057 HE ATTEMPTED FOR THE FIRST TIME TO LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT HIS FAMILY BACKGROUND WHEN HE WENT TO NEW ORLEANS IN APRIL OF NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ043-0058 HE VISITED SOME OF HIS FATHER'S ELDERLY RELATIVES AND THE CEMETERY WHERE HIS FATHER WAS BURIED IN AN EFFORT TO DEVELOP THE FACTS OF HIS GENEALOGY
LJ043-0059 WHILE IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT HE ESTABLISHED ANY NEW RELATIONSHIPS AS A RESULT OF HIS INVESTIGATION HE DID OBTAIN A LARGE PICTURE OF HIS FATHER
LJ043-0060 FROM ONE OF THE ELDERLY RELATIVES WITH WHOM HE SPOKE. OSWALD'S INTEREST IN SUCH THINGS PRESENTS A SHARP CONTRAST WITH HIS ATTITUDE
LJ043-0061 AT THE TIME OF HIS DEFECTION WHEN HE EVIDENCED NO INTEREST IN HIS FATHER AND HARDLY MENTIONED HIM EVEN WHEN QUESTIONED
LJ043-0062 OSWALD'S DEFECTION HIS INTEREST IN THE SOVIET UNION AND HIS ACTIVITIES ON BEHALF OF THE FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE
LJ043-0063 NOT ONLY CAUSED HIM DIFFICULTIES IN HIS EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS BUT THEY ALSO PROVIDED HIM WITH EXCUSES FOR EMPLOYMENT FAILURES
LJ043-0064 WHICH WERE LARGELY OF HIS OWN MAKING
LJ043-0065 OSWALD EXPERIENCED SOME DIFFICULTY FINDING EMPLOYMENT. PERHAPS THIS WAS PARTIALLY BECAUSE OF HIS LACK OF ANY SPECIFIC SKILL OR TRAINING
LJ043-0066 SOME OF HIS ACQUAINTANCES FEELING THAT OSWALD TRIED TO IMPRESS PEOPLE WITH THE FACT THAT HE HAD LIVED AND WORKED IN RUSSIA WERE LED TO THE BELIEF
LJ043-0067 THAT HIS EMPLOYMENT DIFFICULTIES WERE CAUSED BY HIS TELLING PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYERS THAT HE HAD LAST BEEN EMPLOYED IN MINSK
LJ043-0068 WHILE HE MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED DIFFICULTY FROM SUCH AN APPROACH IN FACT
LJ043-0069 THE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT OSWALD USUALLY TOLD HIS PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYMENT COUNSELORS THAT HE HAD RECENTLY BEEN DISCHARGED FROM THE MARINE CORPS
LJ043-0070 OSWALD OBTAINED A JOB IN JULY OF NINETEEN SIXTY TWO AS A SHEET METAL WORKER WITH A COMPANY IN FORT WORTH
LJ043-0071 HIS PERFORMANCE FOR THAT COMPANY WAS SATISFACTORY
LJ043-0072 EVEN THOUGH HE TOLD HIS WIFE THAT HE HAD BEEN FIRED HE VOLUNTARILY LEFT ON OCTOBER 8 NINETEEN SIXTY TWO AND MOVED TO DALLAS
LJ043-0073 ON OCTOBER 9 NINETEEN SIXTY TWO HE WENT TO THE DALLAS OFFICE OF THE TEXAS EMPLOYMENT COMMISSION
LJ043-0074 WHERE HE EXPRESSED A RELUCTANCE TO WORK IN THE INDUSTRIAL FIELD
LJ043-0075 HE INDICATED AN INTEREST IN WRITING. AN EMPLOYMENT COUNSELOR TESTIFIED ON THE BASIS OF A GENERAL APTITUDE TEST OSWALD HAD TAKEN
LJ043-0076 THAT HE HAD SOME APTITUDE IN THAT AREA QUOTE BECAUSE THE VERBAL SCORE IS HIGH AND THE CLERICAL SCORE IS HIGH END QUOTE
LJ043-0077 WHILE THAT COUNSELOR FOUND THAT HE WAS QUALIFIED TO HANDLE MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF JOBS
LJ043-0078 BECAUSE OF HIS NEED FOR IMMEDIATE EMPLOYMENT SHE ATTEMPTED TO OBTAIN FOR HIM ANY JOB THAT WAS AVAILABLE AT THE TIME. OSWALD MADE QUALIFYING MARKS
LJ043-0079 IN NINETEEN OF TWENTY THREE CATEGORIES INCLUDED ON THE GENERAL APTITUDE EXAMINATION AND SCORED 127 ON THE VERBAL TEST AS COMPARED
LJ043-0080 WITH 50 PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE TAKING IT WHO SCORE LESS THAN 100
LJ043-0081 THE COUNSELOR TESTIFIED THAT THERE WAS SOME INDICATION THAT OSWALD WAS CAPABLE OF DOING COLLEGE WORK
LJ043-0082 AND NOTED THAT OSWALD'S VERBAL AND CLERICAL POTENTIAL WAS QUOTE OUTSTANDING END QUOTE
LJ043-0083 EMPLOYMENT COMMISSION RECORDS CONCERNING OSWALD STATED QUOTE WELLGROOMED & SPOKEN
LJ043-0084 BUSINESS SUIT ALERT REPLIES  EXPRESSES SELF EXTREMELY WELL END QUOTE
LJ043-0085 OSWALD SAID THAT HE HOPED EVENTUALLY TO DEVELOP QUALIFICATIONS FOR EMPLOYMENT AS A JUNIOR EXECUTIVE
LJ043-0086 THROUGH A WORKSTUDY PROGRAM AT A LOCAL COLLEGE
LJ043-0087 HE INDICATED HOWEVER THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO DELAY THAT PROGRAM BECAUSE OF HIS IMMEDIATE FINANCIAL NEEDS AND RESPONSIBILITIES
LJ043-0088 ON OCTOBER ELEVEN NINETEEN SIXTY TWO THE EMPLOYMENT COMMISSION REFERRED OSWALD
LJ043-0089 TO A COMMERCIAL ADVERTISING PHOTOGRAPHY FIRM IN DALLAS WHERE HE WAS EMPLOYED AS A TRAINEE STARTING OCTOBER TWELVE NINETEEN SIXTY TWO
LJ043-0090 EVEN THOUGH OSWALD INDICATED THAT HE LIKED PHOTOGRAPHIC WORK HIS EMPLOYER FOUND THAT HE WAS NOT AN EFFICIENT WORKER
LJ043-0091 HE WAS NOT ABLE TO PRODUCE PHOTOGRAPHIC WORK
LJ043-0092 WHICH ADHERED WITH SUFFICIENT PRECISION TO THE JOB SPECIFICATIONS AND AS A RESULT TOO MUCH OF HIS WORK HAD TO BE REDONE
LJ043-0093 HE ALSO HAD DIFFICULTY IN WORKING WITH THE OTHER EMPLOYEES
LJ043-0094 THIS WAS AT LEAST IN PART BECAUSE OF THE CLOSE PHYSICAL CONFINES IN WHICH SOME OF THE WORK HAD TO BE DONE
LJ043-0095 HE DID NOT SEEM TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE ACCOMMODATIONS NECESSARY WHEN PEOPLE WORK UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS AND AS A RESULT
LJ043-0096 BECAME INVOLVED IN CONFLICTS SOME OF WHICH WERE FAIRLY HEATED WITH HIS FELLOW EMPLOYEES
LJ043-0097 IN FEBRUARY OR MARCH OF NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ043-0098 IT BEGAN TO APPEAR THAT OSWALD WAS HAVING CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY DOING ACCURATE WORK AND IN GETTING ALONG WITH THE OTHER EMPLOYEES
LJ043-0099 IT APPEARS THAT HIS DISCHARGE WAS HASTENED BY THE FACT THAT HE BROUGHT A RUSSIAN LANGUAGE NEWSPAPER TO WORK
LJ043-0100 IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO TELL WHETHER OSWALD DID THIS TO PROVIDE AN EXCUSE FOR HIS EVENTUAL DISCHARGE
LJ043-0101 OR WHETHER HE BROUGHT THE RUSSIAN LANGUAGE NEWSPAPER WITH HIM ONE DAY AFTER HIS OTHER DIFFICULTIES BECAME CLEAR
LJ043-0102 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HIS IMMEDIATE SUPERVISOR NOTICED THE NEWSPAPER AT THAT TIME BECAUSE HIS ATTENTION HAD OTHERWISE BEEN DRAWN MORE DIRECTLY TO OSWALD
LJ043-0103 IN ANY EVENT OSWALD WAS DISCHARGED ON APRIL 6 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE OSTENSIBLY BECAUSE OF HIS INEFFICIENCY AND DIFFICULT PERSONALITY
LJ043-0104 HIS SUPERVISOR ADMITTED HOWEVER
LJ043-0105 THAT WHILE HE DID NOT FIRE OSWALD BECAUSE OF THE NEWSPAPER INCIDENT OR EVEN WEIGH IT HEAVILY IN HIS DECISION QUOTE
LJ043-0106 IT DIDN'T DO HIS CASE ANY GOOD END QUOTE
LJ043-0107 UPON MOVING TO NEW ORLEANS ON APRIL 24 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ043-0108 OSWALD'S EMPLOYMENT PROBLEMS BECAME MORE DIFFICULT. HE LEFT HIS WIFE AND CHILD AT THE HOME OF A FRIEND MRS. RUTH PAINE OF IRVING TEXAS
LJ043-0109 IN NEW ORLEANS HE OBTAINED WORK AS A GREASER AND OILER OF COFFEE PROCESSING MACHINES FOR THE WILLIAM B. REILY CO
LJ043-0110 BEGINNING MAY TEN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ043-0111 AFTER SECURING THIS JOB AND AN APARTMENT OSWALD ASKED HIS WIFE TO JOIN HIM
LJ043-0112 MRS. PAINE BROUGHT OSWALD'S FAMILY TO NEW ORLEANS
LJ043-0113 REFUSING TO ADMIT THAT HE COULD ONLY GET WORK AS A GREASER
LJ043-0114 OSWALD TOLD HIS WIFE AND MRS. PAINE THAT HE WAS WORKING AS A COMMERCIAL PHOTOGRAPHER
LJ043-0115 HE LOST HIS JOB ON JULY NINETEEN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE BECAUSE HIS WORK WAS NOT SATISFACTORY
LJ043-0116 AND BECAUSE HE SPENT TOO MUCH TIME LOITERING IN THE GARAGE NEXT DOOR WHERE HE READ RIFLE AND HUNTING MAGAZINES
LJ043-0117 OSWALD APPARENTLY CONCLUDED THAT HIS FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES WERE NOT RELATED TO HIS DISCHARGE
LJ043-0118 THE CORRECTNESS OF THAT CONCLUSION IS SUPPORTED BY THE FACT THAT HE DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE BEEN PUBLICLY IDENTIFIED WITH THAT ORGANIZATION UNTIL AUGUST 9
LJ043-0119 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE ALMOST A MONTH AFTER HE LOST HIS JOB
LJ043-0120 HIS FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES HOWEVER MADE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO OBTAIN OTHER EMPLOYMENT
LJ043-0121 A PLACEMENT INTERVIEWER OF THE LOUISIANA DEPARTMENT OF LABOR
LJ043-0122 WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY INTERVIEWED OSWALD SAW HIM ON TELEVISION AND HEARD A RADIO DEBATE IN WHICH HE ENGAGED ON AUGUST TWENTY ONE NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ043-0123 HE CONSULTED WITH HIS SUPERVISOR AND QUOTE IT WAS DETERMINED THAT WE SHOULD NOT UNDERTAKE TO FURNISH EMPLOYMENT REFERENCES FOR HIM END QUOTE
LJ043-0124 IRONICALLY HE FAILED TO GET A JOB IN ANOTHER PHOTOGRAPHIC FIRM AFTER HIS RETURN TO DALLAS IN OCTOBER OF NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ043-0125 BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT OF THE PHOTOGRAPHIC FIRM FOR WHICH HE HAD PREVIOUSLY WORKED
LJ043-0126 TOLD THE PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYER THAT OSWALD WAS QUOTE KINDA PECULIAR SOMETIMES AND THAT HE HAD SOME KNOWLEDGE OF THE RUSSIAN LANGUAGE END QUOTE
LJ043-0127 AND THAT HE QUOTE MAY BE A DAMN COMMUNIST. I CAN'T TELL YOU. IF I WAS YOU I WOULDN'T HIRE HIM END QUOTE
LJ043-0128 THE PLANT SUPERINTENDENT OF THE NEW FIRM TESTIFIED THAT ONE OF THE EMPLOYEES OF THE OLD FIRM QUOTE
LJ043-0129 IMPLIED THAT OSWALD'S FELLOW EMPLOYEES DID NOT LIKE HIM BECAUSE HE WAS PROPAGANDIZING
LJ043-0130 AND HAD BEEN SEEN READING A FOREIGN NEWSPAPER END QUOTE
LJ043-0131 AS A RESULT OSWALD WAS NOT HIRED
LJ043-0132 HE SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND A JOB WITH THE TEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY FOR WHICH HE PERFORMED HIS DUTIES SATISFACTORILY
LJ043-0133 ATTACK ON GENERAL WALKER
LJ043-0134 THE COMMISSION HAS CONCLUDED THAT ON APRIL TEN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ043-0135 OSWALD SHOT AT MAJ. GEN. EDWIN A. WALKER RESIGNED U.S. ARMY
LJ043-0136 DEMONSTRATING ONCE AGAIN HIS PROPENSITY TO ACT DRAMATICALLY AND IN THIS INSTANCE VIOLENTLY IN FURTHERANCE OF HIS BELIEFS
LJ043-0137 THE SHOOTING OCCURRED 2 WEEKS BEFORE OSWALD MOVED TO NEW ORLEANS AND A FEW DAYS AFTER HE HAD BEEN DISCHARGED BY THE PHOTOGRAPHIC FIRM
LJ043-0138 AS INDICATED IN CHAPTER 4 OSWALD HAD BEEN PLANNING HIS ATTACK ON GENERAL WALKER FOR AT LEAST ONE AND PERHAPS AS MUCH AS 2 MONTHS
LJ043-0139 HE OUTLINED HIS PLANS IN A NOTEBOOK AND STUDIED THEM AT CONSIDERABLE LENGTH BEFORE HIS ATTACK
LJ043-0140 HE ALSO STUDIED DALLAS BUS SCHEDULES TO PREPARE FOR HIS LATER USE OF BUSES TO TRAVEL TO AND FROM GENERAL WALKER'S HOUSE
LJ043-0141 SOMETIME AFTER MARCH 27 BUT ACCORDING TO MARINA OSWALD PRIOR TO APRIL TEN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ043-0142 OSWALD POSED FOR TWO PICTURES
LJ043-0143 WITH HIS RECENTLY ACQUIRED RIFLE AND PISTOL A COPY OF THE MARCH TWENTY FOUR NINETEEN SIXTY THREE ISSUE OF THE WORKER
LJ043-0144 AND THE MARCH ELEVEN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE ISSUE OF THE MILITANT
LJ043-0145 HE TOLD HIS WIFE THAT HE WANTED TO SEND THE PICTURES TO THE MILITANT AND HE ALSO ASKED HER TO KEEP ONE OF THE PICTURES FOR HIS DAUGHTER JUNE
LJ043-0146 FOLLOWING HIS UNSUCCESSFUL ATTACK ON WALKER OSWALD RETURNED HOME
LJ043-0147 HE HAD LEFT A NOTE FOR HIS WIFE TELLING HER WHAT TO DO IN CASE HE WERE APPREHENDED AS WELL AS HIS NOTEBOOK AND THE PICTURES OF HIMSELF HOLDING THE RIFLE
LJ043-0148 SHE TESTIFIED THAT SHE WAS AGITATED BECAUSE SHE HAD FOUND THE NOTE IN OSWALD'S ROOM
LJ043-0149 WHERE SHE HAD GONE CONTRARY TO HIS INSTRUCTIONS AFTER SHE BECAME WORRIED ABOUT HIS ABSENCE
LJ043-0150 SHE INDICATED THAT SHE HAD NO ADVANCE KNOWLEDGE OF OSWALD'S PLANS
LJ043-0151 THAT SHE BECAME QUITE ANGRY WHEN OSWALD TOLD HER WHAT HE HAD DONE AND THAT SHE MADE HIM PROMISE NEVER TO REPEAT SUCH A PERFORMANCE
LJ043-0152 SHE SAID THAT SHE KEPT THE NOTE TO USE AGAINST HIM QUOTE IF SOMETHING LIKE THAT SHOULD BE REPEATED AGAIN END QUOTE
LJ043-0153 WHEN ASKED IF OSWALD REQUESTED THE NOTE BACK SHE TESTIFIED THAT QUOTE HE FORGOT ABOUT IT BUT APPARENTLY
LJ043-0154 AFTER HE THOUGHT THAT WHAT HE HAD WRITTEN IN HIS BOOK MIGHT BE PROOF AGAINST HIM AND HE DESTROYED IT THE BOOK END QUOTE
LJ043-0155 SHE LATER GAVE THE FOLLOWING TESTIMONY QUESTION
LJ043-0156 AFTER HE BROUGHT THE RIFLE HOME THEN HE SHOWED YOU THE BOOK
LJ043-0157 ANSWER YES. QUESTION AND YOU SAID IT WAS NOT A GOOD IDEA TO KEEP THIS BOOK ANSWER YES
LJ043-0158 QUESTION AND THEN HE BURNED THE BOOK
LJ043-0159 ANSWER YES
LJ043-0160 QUESTION DID YOU ASK HIM WHY HE HAD NOT DESTROYED THE BOOK BEFORE HE ACTUALLY WENT TO SHOOT GENERAL WALKER
LJ043-0161 ANSWER IT NEVER CAME TO ME MYSELF TO ASK HIM THAT QUESTION
LJ043-0162 MARINA OSWALD'S TESTIMONY INDICATES THAT HER HUSBAND WAS NOT PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT HIS CONTINUED POSSESSION OF THE MOST INCRIMINATING SORT OF EVIDENCE
LJ043-0163 IF HE HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND HAD BEEN APPREHENDED EVEN FOR ROUTINE QUESTIONING HIS APARTMENT WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE BEEN SEARCHED
LJ043-0164 AND HIS ROLE WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE CLEAR BY THE EVIDENCE WHICH HE HAD LEFT BEHIND
LJ043-0165 LEAVING THE NOTE AND PICTURE AS HE DID WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT HE HAD CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITY OF CAPTURE
LJ043-0166 POSSIBLY HE MIGHT HAVE WANTED TO BE CAUGHT AND WANTED HIS INVOLVEMENT MADE CLEAR IF HE WAS IN FACT APPREHENDED
LJ043-0167 EVEN AFTER HIS WIFE TOLD HIM TO DESTROY THE NOTEBOOK
LJ043-0168 HE REMOVED AT LEAST SOME OF THE PICTURES WHICH HAD BEEN PASTED IN IT AND SAVED THEM AMONG HIS EFFECTS WHERE THEY WERE FOUND AFTER THE ASSASSINATION
LJ043-0169 HIS BEHAVIOR WAS ENTIRELY CONSISTENT WITH HIS WIFE'S TESTIMONY THAT QUOTE
LJ043-0170 I ASKED HIM WHAT FOR HE WAS MAKING ALL THESE ENTRIES IN THE BOOK AND HE ANSWERED THAT HE WANTED TO LEAVE A COMPLETE RECORD SO THAT ALL THE DETAILS WOULD BE IN IT
LJ043-0171 I AM GUESSING THAT PERHAPS HE DID IT TO APPEAR TO BE A BRAVE MAN IN CASE HE WERE ARRESTED BUT THAT IS MY SUPPOSITION END QUOTE
LJ043-0172 THE ATTEMPT ON GENERAL WALKER'S LIFE DESERVES CLOSE ATTENTION IN ANY CONSIDERATION OF OSWALD'S POSSIBLE MOTIVE FOR THE ASSASSINATION
LJ043-0173 AND THE TRAIL OF EVIDENCE HE LEFT BEHIND HIM ON THAT OCCASION
LJ043-0174 WHILE THERE ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO EVENTS AS FAR AS OSWALD'S ACTIONS AND PLANNING ARE CONCERNED THERE ARE ALSO SIMILARITIES THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED
LJ043-0175 THE ITEMS WHICH OSWALD LEFT AT HOME WHEN HE MADE HIS ATTACK ON WALKER SUGGEST A STRONG CONCERN FOR HIS PLACE IN HISTORY
LJ043-0176 IF THE ATTACK HAD SUCCEEDED AND OSWALD HAD BEEN CAUGHT THE PICTURES SHOWING HIM WITH HIS RIFLE
LJ043-0177 AND HIS COMMUNIST AND SOCIALIST WORKER'S PARTY NEWSPAPERS WOULD PROBABLY HAVE APPEARED ON THE FRONT PAGES OF NEWSPAPERS OR MAGAZINES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
LJ043-0178 AS IN FACT ONE OF THEM DID APPEAR AFTER THE ASSASSINATION
LJ043-0179 THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE ATTACK ON WALKER COUPLED WITH OTHER INDICATIONS THAT OSWALD WAS CONCERNED ABOUT HIS PLACE IN HISTORY
LJ043-0180 AND WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE ASSASSINATION HAVE LED THE COMMISSION TO BELIEVE
LJ043-0181 THAT SUCH CONCERN IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR TO CONSIDER IN ASSESSING POSSIBLE MOTIVATION FOR THE ASSASSINATION
LJ043-0182 IN ANY EVENT THE WALKER INCIDENT INDICATES THAT IN SPITE OF THE BELIEF AMONG THOSE WHO KNEW HIM THAT HE WAS APPARENTLY NOT DANGEROUS
LJ043-0183 OSWALD DID NOT LACK THE DETERMINATION AND OTHER TRAITS REQUIRED
LJ043-0184 TO CARRY OUT A CAREFULLY PLANNED KILLING OF ANOTHER HUMAN BEING AND WAS WILLING TO CONSUMMATE SUCH A PURPOSE IF HE THOUGHT THERE WAS SUFFICIENT REASON TO DO SO
LJ043-0185 SOME IDEA OF WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS SUFFICIENT REASON FOR SUCH AN ACT MAY BE FOUND IN THE NATURE OF THE MOTIVE THAT HE STATED FOR HIS ATTACK ON GENERAL WALKER
LJ043-0186 MARINA OSWALD INDICATED THAT HER HUSBAND HAD COMPARED GENERAL WALKER TO ADOLPH HITLER
LJ043-0187 SHE TESTIFIED THAT OSWALD SAID THAT GENERAL WALKER QUOTE WAS A VERY BAD MAN THAT HE WAS A FASCIST
LJ043-0188 THAT HE WAS THE LEADER OF A FASCIST ORGANIZATION AND WHEN I SAID THAT EVEN THOUGH ALL OF THAT MIGHT BE TRUE JUST THE SAME HE HAD NO RIGHT TO TAKE HIS LIFE

LJ044-0003 LEE HARVEY OSWALD BACKGROUND AND POSSIBLE MOTIVES PART 5
LJ044-0004 POLITICAL ACTIVITIES
LJ044-0005 OSWALD'S POLITICAL ACTIVITIES AFTER HIS RETURN TO THE UNITED STATES CENTER AROUND HIS INTEREST IN CUBA AND IN THE FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE
LJ044-0006 ALTHOUGH AS INDICATED ABOVE THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN UNABLE TO FIND ANY CREDIBLE EVIDENCE
LJ044-0007 THAT HE WAS INVOLVED IN ANY CONSPIRACY HIS POLITICAL ACTIVITIES DO PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OSWALD'S CHARACTER
LJ044-0008 AND INTO HIS POSSIBLE MOTIVATION FOR THE ASSASSINATION
LJ044-0009 WHILE IT APPEARS THAT HE MAY HAVE DISTRIBUTED FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE MATERIALS ON ONE UNEVENTFUL OCCASION IN DALLAS SOMETIME DURING THE PERIOD
LJ044-0010 APRIL 6 TO 24 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE OSWALD'S FIRST PUBLIC IDENTIFICATION WITH THAT CAUSE WAS IN NEW ORLEANS
LJ044-0011 THERE IN LATE MAY AND EARLY JUNE OF NINETEEN SIXTY THREE UNDER THE NAME LEE OSBORNE
LJ044-0012 HE HAD PRINTED A HANDBILL HEADED IN LARGE LETTERS QUOTE
LJ044-0013 HANDS OFF CUBA END QUOTE AN APPLICATION FORM FOR AND A MEMBERSHIP CARD IN
LJ044-0014 THE NEW ORLEANS BRANCH OF THE FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE
LJ044-0015 HE FIRST DISTRIBUTED HIS HANDBILLS AND OTHER MATERIAL UNEVENTFULLY IN THE VICINITY OF THE U.S.S. WASP
LJ044-0016 WHICH WAS BERTHED AT THE DUMAINE STREET WHARF IN NEW ORLEANS ON JUNE SIXTEEN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ044-0017 HE DISTRIBUTED LITERATURE IN DOWNTOWN NEW ORLEANS ON AUGUST 9 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ044-0018 AND WAS ARRESTED BECAUSE OF A DISPUTE WITH THREE ANTICASTRO CUBAN EXILES AND AGAIN ON AUGUST SIXTEEN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ044-0019 FOLLOWING HIS ARREST HE WAS INTERVIEWED BY THE POLICE AND AT HIS OWN REQUEST BY AN AGENT OF THE FBI
LJ044-0020 ON AUGUST SEVENTEEN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE HE APPEARED BRIEFLY ON A RADIO PROGRAM AND ON AUGUST TWENTY ONE NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ044-0021 HE DEBATED OVER RADIO STATION WDSU NEW ORLEANS WITH CARLOS BRINGUIER
LJ044-0022 ONE OF THE CUBAN EXILES WHO HAD BEEN ARRESTED WITH HIM ON AUGUST 9. BRINGUIER CLAIMED THAT ON AUGUST 5 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ044-0023 OSWALD HAD ATTEMPTED TO INFILTRATE AN ANTICASTRO ORGANIZATION WITH WHICH HE WAS ASSOCIATED
LJ044-0024 WHILE OSWALD PUBLICLY ENGAGED IN THE ACTIVITIES DESCRIBED ABOVE HIS QUOTE ORGANIZATION END QUOTE WAS A PRODUCT OF HIS IMAGINATION
LJ044-0025 THE IMAGINARY PRESIDENT OF THE NONEXISTENT CHAPTER WAS NAMED A. J. HIDELL THE NAME THAT OSWALD USED WHEN HE PURCHASED THE ASSASSINATION WEAPON
LJ044-0026 MARINA OSWALD SAID SHE SIGNED THAT NAME APPARENTLY CHOSEN BECAUSE IT RHYMED WITH FIDEL
LJ044-0027 TO HER HUSBAND'S MEMBERSHIP CARD IN THE NEW ORLEANS CHAPTER
LJ044-0028 SHE TESTIFIED THAT HE THREATENED TO BEAT HER IF SHE DID NOT DO SO. THE CHAPTER HAD NEVER BEEN CHARTERED BY THE NATIONAL FPCC ORGANIZATION
LJ044-0029 IT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN A SOLITARY OPERATION ON OSWALD'S PART IN SPITE OF HIS MISSTATEMENTS TO THE NEW ORLEANS POLICE THAT IT HAD 35 MEMBERS
LJ044-0030 5 OF WHICH WERE USUALLY PRESENT AT MEETINGS WHICH WERE HELD ONCE A MONTH
LJ044-0031 OSWALD'S FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA ACTIVITIES MAY BE VIEWED AS A VERY SHREWD POLITICAL OPERATION
LJ044-0032 IN WHICH ONE MAN SINGLE HANDEDLY CREATED PUBLICITY FOR HIS CAUSE OR FOR HIMSELF
LJ044-0033 IT IS ALSO EVIDENCE OF OSWALD'S RELUCTANCE TO DESCRIBE EVENTS ACCURATELY
LJ044-0034 AND OF HIS NEED TO PRESENT HIMSELF TO OTHERS AS WELL AS TO HIMSELF IN A LIGHT MORE FAVORABLE THAN WAS JUSTIFIED BY REALITY
LJ044-0035 THIS IS SUGGESTED BY HIS MISLEADING AND SOMETIME UNTRUTHFUL STATEMENTS IN HIS LETTERS TO MR. V. T. LEE
LJ044-0036 THEN NATIONAL DIRECTOR OF FPCC. IN ONE OF THOSE LETTERS DATED AUGUST 1 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ044-0037 OSWALD WROTE THAT AN OFFICE WHICH HE HAD PREVIOUSLY CLAIMED TO HAVE RENTED FOR FPCC ACTIVITIES HAD BEEN QUOTE
LJ044-0038 PROMPTLY CLOSED 3 DAYS LATER FOR SOME OBSCURE REASONS BY THE RENTERS
LJ044-0039 THEY SAID SOMETHING ABOUT REMODELING ETC. I'M SURE YOU UNDERSTAND END QUOTE
LJ044-0040 HE WROTE THAT QUOTE THOUSANDS OF CIRCULARS WERE DISTRIBUTED END QUOTE
LJ044-0041 AND THAT HE CONTINUED TO RECEIVE INQUIRIES THROUGH HIS POST OFFICE BOX WHICH HE ENDEAVORED QUOTE TO KEEP ANSWERING TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY END QUOTE
LJ044-0042 IN HIS LETTER TO V. T. LEE
LJ044-0043 HE STATED THAT HE WAS THEN ALONE IN HIS EFFORTS ON BEHALF OF FPCC BUT HE ATTRIBUTED HIS LACK OF SUPPORT
LJ044-0044 TO AN ATTACK BY CUBAN EXILES IN A STREET DEMONSTRATION AND BEING QUOTE OFFICIALY CAUTIONED END QUOTE BY THE POLICE
LJ044-0045 EVENTS WHICH QUOTE ROBBED ME OF WHAT SUPPORT I HAD LEAVING ME ALONE END QUOTE
LJ044-0047 THAT ANYONE EVER ATTACKED ANY STREET DEMONSTRATION IN WHICH OSWALD WAS INVOLVED EXCEPT FOR THE BRINGUIER INCIDENT MENTIONED ABOVE
LJ044-0048 WHICH OCCURRED 8 DAYS AFTER OSWALD WROTE THE ABOVE LETTER TO V. T. LEE
LJ044-0049 BRINGUIER WHO SEEMED TO BE FAMILIAR WITH MANY ANTICASTRO ACTIVITIES IN NEW ORLEANS WAS NOT AWARE OF ANY SUCH INCIDENT
LJ044-0050 POLICE REPORTS ALSO FAIL TO REFLECT ANY ACTIVITY ON OSWALD'S PART PRIOR TO AUGUST NINE NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ044-0051 EXCEPT FOR THE UNEVENTFUL DISTRIBUTION OF LITERATURE AT THE DUMAINE STREET WHARF IN JUNE
LJ044-0052 FURTHERMORE THE GENERAL TENOR OF OSWALD'S NEXT LETTER TO V. T. LEE
LJ044-0053 IN WHICH HE SUPPORTED HIS REPORT ON THE BRINGUIER INCIDENT WITH A COPY OF THE CHARGES MADE AGAINST HIM
LJ044-0054 AND A NEWSPAPER CLIPPING REPORTING THE EVENT SUGGESTS THAT HIS PREVIOUS STORY OF AN ATTACK BY CUBAN EXILES WAS AT LEAST GREATLY EXAGGERATED
LJ044-0055 WHILE THE LEGEND QUOTE FPCC 544 CAMP STREET NEW ORLEANS LOUISIANA END QUOTE
LJ044-0056 WAS STAMPED ON SOME LITERATURE THAT OSWALD HAD IN HIS POSSESSION AT THE TIME OF HIS ARREST IN NEW ORLEANS
LJ044-0057 EXTENSIVE INVESTIGATION WAS NOT ABLE TO CONNECT OSWALD WITH THAT ADDRESS ALTHOUGH IT DID DEVELOP THE FACT
LJ044-0058 THAT AN ANTICASTRO ORGANIZATION HAD MAINTAINED OFFICES THERE FOR A PERIOD ENDING EARLY IN NINETEEN SIXTY TWO
LJ044-0059 THE COMMISSION HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY OTHER INDICATION THAT OSWALD HAD RENTED AN OFFICE IN NEW ORLEANS
LJ044-0060 IN VIEW OF THE LIMITED AMOUNT OF PUBLIC ACTIVITY ON OSWALD'S PART BEFORE AUGUST NINE NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ044-0061 THERE ALSO SEEMS TO BE NO BASIS FOR HIS CLAIM THAT HE HAD DISTRIBUTED QUOTE
LJ044-0062 THOUSANDS END QUOTE OF CIRCULARS ESPECIALLY SINCE HE HAD CLAIMED TO HAVE PRINTED ONLY 2000
LJ044-0063 AND ACTUALLY HAD ONLY 1000 PRINTED
LJ044-0064 IN ADDITION THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE RECEIVED ANY SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF MATERIALS FROM THE NATIONAL HEADQUARTERS
LJ044-0065 IN ANOTHER LETTER TO V. T. LEE DATED AUGUST SEVENTEEN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ044-0066 OSWALD WROTE THAT HE HAD APPEARED ON MR. WILLIAM STUCKEY'S FIFTEEN MINUTE TELEVISION PROGRAM OVER WDSUTV CALLED QUOTE
LJ044-0067 LATIN AMERICAN FOCUS END QUOTE
LJ044-0068 AS A RESULT OF WHICH HE WAS QUOTE FLOODED WITH CALLERS AND INVITATIONS TO DEBATES ETC. AS WELL AS PEOPLE INTERESTED IN JOINING THE F.P.C.C.
LJ044-0069 NEW ORLEANS BRANCH END QUOTE
LJ044-0070 WDSU HAS NO PROGRAM OF ANY KIND CALLED QUOTE LATIN AMERICAN FOCUS END QUOTE
LJ044-0071 STUCKEY HAD A RADIO PROGRAM CALLED QUOTE LATIN LISTENING POST END QUOTE
LJ044-0072 ON WHICH OSWALD WAS HEARD FOR LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES ON AUGUST SEVENTEEN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ044-0073 IT APPEARS THAT OSWALD HAD ONLY ONE CALLER IN RESPONSE TO ALL OF HIS FPCC ACTIVITIES
LJ044-0074 AN AGENT OF BRINGUIER'S ATTEMPTING TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE TRUE NATURE
LJ044-0075 OF THE ALLEGED FPCC QUOTE ORGANIZATION END QUOTE IN NEW ORLEANS
LJ044-0076 OSWALD'S STATEMENTS SUGGEST THAT HE HOPED TO BE FLOODED WITH CALLERS AND INVITATIONS TO DEBATE
LJ044-0077 THIS WOULD HAVE MADE HIM A REAL CENTER OF ATTENTION AS HE MUST HAVE BEEN WHEN HE FIRST ARRIVED IN THE SOVIET UNION
LJ044-0078 AND AS HE WAS TO SOME EXTENT WHEN HE RETURNED TO THE UNITED STATES
LJ044-0079 THE LIMITED NOTORIETY THAT OSWALD RECEIVED AS A RESULT OF THE STREET FRACAS AND IN THE SUBSEQUENT RADIO DEBATE
LJ044-0080 WAS APPARENTLY NOT ENOUGH TO SATISFY HIM HE EXAGGERATED IN HIS LETTERS TO V. T. LEE IN AN APPARENT ATTEMPT
LJ044-0081 TO MAKE HIMSELF AND HIS ACTIVITIES APPEAR FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAN THEY REALLY WERE
LJ044-0082 HIS ATTEMPT TO EXPRESS HIMSELF THROUGH HIS FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA ACTIVITIES HOWEVER
LJ044-0083 WAS GREATLY IMPEDED BY THE FACT THAT THE RADIO DEBATE OVER WDSU ON AUGUST TWENTY ONE NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ044-0084 BROUGHT OUT THE HISTORY OF HIS DEFECTION TO THE SOVIET UNION
LJ044-0085 THE BASIC FACTS OF THE EVENT WERE UNCOVERED INDEPENDENTLY BY WILLIAM STUCKEY WHO ARRANGED THE DEBATE AND EDWARD BUTLER
LJ044-0086 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INFORMATION COUNCIL OF THE AMERICAS WHO ALSO APPEARED ON THE PROGRAM
LJ044-0087 OSWALD WAS CONFRONTED WITH THOSE FACTS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DEBATE AND WAS SO THROWN ON THE DEFENSIVE BY THIS THAT HE WAS FORCED TO STATE THAT
LJ044-0088 FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA WAS QUOTE NOT AT ALL COMMUNIST CONTROLLED REGARDLESS OF THE FACT THAT I HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF LIVING IN RUSSIA END QUOTE
LJ044-0089 STUCKEY TESTIFIED THAT UNCOVERING OSWALD'S DEFECTION WAS VERY IMPORTANT QUOTE
LJ044-0090 I THINK THAT WE FINISHED HIM ON THAT PROGRAM BECAUSE WE HAD PUBLICLY LINKED THE FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE
LJ044-0091 WITH A FELLOW WHO HAD LIVED IN RUSSIA FOR THREE YEARS AND WHO WAS AN ADMITTED MARXIST
LJ044-0092 THE INTERESTING THING OR RATHER THE DANGER INVOLVED WAS THE FACT THAT OSWALD SEEMED LIKE SUCH A NICE BRIGHT BOY
LJ044-0093 AND WAS EXTREMELY BELIEVABLE BEFORE THIS. WE THOUGHT THE FELLOW COULD PROBABLY GET QUITE A FEW MEMBERS IF HE WAS REALLY INDEED SERIOUS ABOUT GETTING MEMBERS
LJ044-0094 WE FIGURED AFTER THIS BROADCAST OF AUGUST TWENTY ONE WHY THAT WAS NO LONGER POSSIBLE END QUOTE
LJ044-0095 IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT OSWALD HAD BEEN SURPRISED AND WAS ON THE DEFENSIVE THROUGHOUT THE DEBATE ACCORDING TO STUCKEY QUOTE
LJ044-0096 MR. OSWALD HANDLED HIMSELF VERY WELL AS USUAL END QUOTE
LJ044-0097 STUCKEY THOUGHT OSWALD QUOTE APPEARED TO BE A VERY LOGICAL INTELLIGENT FELLOW END QUOTE AND QUOTE WAS ARRESTED BY HIS CLEANCUTNESS END QUOTE
LJ044-0098 HE DID NOT THINK OSWALD LOOKED LIKE THE QUOTE TYPE END QUOTE THAT HE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED TO FIND ASSOCIATING WITH A GROUP SUCH AS THE FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE
LJ044-0099 STUCKEY THOUGHT THAT OSWALD ACTED VERY MUCH AS WOULD A YOUNG ATTORNEY
LJ044-0100 FOLLOWING THE DISCLOSURE OF HIS DEFECTION OSWALD SOUGHT ADVICE FROM THE COMMUNIST PARTY U.S.A. CONCERNING HIS FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA ACTIVITY
LJ044-0101 HE HAD PREVIOUSLY SENT APPARENTLY UNSOLICITED TO THE PARTY NEWSPAPER THE WORKER
LJ044-0102 SAMPLES OF HIS PHOTOGRAPHIC WORK OFFERING TO CONTRIBUTE THAT SORT OF SERVICE WITHOUT CHARGE
LJ044-0103 THE WORKER REPLIED QUOTE YOUR KIND OFFER IS MOST WELCOMED AND FROM TIME TO TIME WE SHALL CALL ON YOU END QUOTE
LJ044-0104 HE LATER WROTE TO ANOTHER OFFICIAL OF THE WORKER SEEKING EMPLOYMENT AND MENTIONING THE PRAISE HE HAD RECEIVED FOR SUBMITTING HIS PHOTOGRAPHIC WORK
LJ044-0105 HE PRESENTED ARNOLD JOHNSON GUS HALL
LJ044-0106 AND BENJAMIN J. DAVIS HONORARY MEMBERSHIP CARDS IN HIS NONEXISTENT NEW ORLEANS CHAPTER OF THE FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE
LJ044-0107 AND ADVISED THEM OF SOME OF HIS ACTIVITIES ON BEHALF OF THE ORGANIZATION
LJ044-0108 ARNOLD JOHNSON DIRECTOR OF THE INFORMATION AND LECTURE BUREAU OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY U.S.A. REPLIED STATING QUOTE
LJ044-0109 IT IS GOOD TO KNOW THAT MOVEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA HAS DEVELOPED IN NEW ORLEANS AS WELL AS IN OTHER CITIES
LJ044-0110 WE DO NOT HAVE ANY ORGANIZATIONAL TIES WITH THE COMMITTEE AND YET THERE IS MUCH MATERIAL THAT WE ISSUE FROM TIME TO TIME THAT IS IMPORTANT
LJ044-0111 FOR ANYBODY WHO IS CONCERNED ABOUT DEVELOPMENTS IN CUBA END QUOTE
LJ044-0112 MARINA OSWALD SAID THAT SUCH CORRESPONDENCE FROM PEOPLE HE CONSIDERED IMPORTANT MEANT MUCH TO OSWALD
LJ044-0113 AFTER HE HAD BEGUN HIS CUBAN ACTIVITY IN NEW ORLEANS QUOTE
LJ044-0114 HE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM SOMEBODY IN NEW YORK SOME COMMUNIST  PROBABLY FROM NEW YORK  I AM NOT SURE FROM WHERE  FROM SOME COMMUNIST LEADER AND HE WAS VERY HAPPY
LJ044-0115 HE FELT THAT THIS WAS A GREAT MAN THAT HE HAD RECEIVED THE LETTER FROM END QUOTE
LJ044-0116 SINCE HE SEEMED TO FEEL THAT NO ONE ELSE UNDERSTOOD HIS POLITICAL VIEWS THE LETTER WAS OF GREAT VALUE TO HIM FOR IT QUOTE WAS PROOF
LJ044-0117 THAT THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTOOD HIS ACTIVITY END QUOTE
LJ044-0118 HE ANTICIPATED THAT THE FULL DISCLOSURE OF HIS DEFECTION WOULD HINDER HIM IN QUOTE THE STRUGGLE FOR PROGRESS AND FREEDOM IN THE UNITED STATES END QUOTE
LJ044-0119 INTO WHICH OSWALD IN HIS OWN WORDS HAD QUOTE THROWN HIMSELF HE SOUGHT ADVICE FROM THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY U.S.A.
LJ044-0120 IN A LETTER DATED AUGUST TWENTY EIGHT NINETEEN SIXTY THREE ABOUT WHETHER HE COULD QUOTE CONTINUE TO FIGHT
LJ044-0121 HANDICAPPED AS IT WERE BY MY PAST RECORD AND COMPETE WITH ANTIPROGRESSIVE FORCES ABOVEGROUND OR WHETHER IN YOUR OPINION
LJ044-0122 I SHOULD ALWAYS REMAIN IN THE BACKGROUND I.E. UNDERGROUND END QUOTE
LJ044-0123 STATING THAT HE HAD USED HIS POSITION WITH WHAT HE CLAIMED TO BE THE LOCAL BRANCH OF THE FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE TO QUOTE FOSTER COMMUNIST IDEALS END QUOTE
LJ044-0124 OSWALD WROTE THAT HE FELT THAT HE MIGHT HAVE COMPROMISED THE FPCC AND EXPRESSED CONCERN LEST QUOTE OUR OPPONENTS COULD USE MY BACKGROUND
LJ044-0125 OF RESIDENCE IN THE U.S.S.R. AGAINST ANY CAUSE WHICH I JOIN BY ASSOCIATION
LJ044-0126 THEY COULD SAY THE ORGANIZATION OF WHICH I AM A MEMBER IS RUSSIAN CONTROLLED ETC END QUOTE
LJ044-0127 IN REPLY ARNOLD JOHNSON ADVISED OSWALD THAT WHILE AS AN AMERICAN CITIZEN HE HAD A RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN SUCH ORGANIZATIONS AS HE WISHED QUOTE
LJ044-0128 THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING POSSIBLY FAIR PLAY WHICH ARE OF A VERY BROAD CHARACTER
LJ044-0129 AND OFTEN IT IS ADVISABLE FOR SOME PEOPLE TO REMAIN IN THE BACKGROUND NOT UNDERGROUND END QUOTE
LJ044-0130 BY AUGUST OF NINETEEN SIXTY THREE AFTER A SHORT 3 MONTHS IN NEW ORLEANS THE CITY IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN BORN AND HAD LIVED MOST OF HIS EARLY LIFE
LJ044-0131 OSWALD HAD FALLEN ON DIFFICULT TIMES
LJ044-0132 HE HAD NOT LIKED HIS JOB AS A GREASER OF COFFEE PROCESSING MACHINERY AND HE HELD IT FOR ONLY A LITTLE OVER 2 MONTHS
LJ044-0133 HE HAD NOT FOUND ANOTHER JOB HIS WIFE WAS EXPECTING THEIR SECOND CHILD IN OCTOBER AND THERE WAS CONCERN ABOUT THE COST WHICH WOULD BE INVOLVED
LJ044-0134 HIS BRIEF FORAY ON BEHALF OF THE FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE HAD 5FAILED TO WIN ANY SUPPORT
LJ044-0135 WHILE HE HAD DRAWN SOME ATTENTION TO HIMSELF AND HAD ACTUALLY APPEARED ON TWO RADIO PROGRAMS HE HAD BEEN ATTACKED BY CUBAN EXILES AND ARRESTED
LJ044-0136 AN EVENT WHICH HIS WIFE THOUGHT UPSET HIM AND AS A RESULT OF WHICH QUOTE HE BECAME LESS ACTIVE HE COOLED OFF A LITTLE END QUOTE
LJ044-0137 MORE SERIOUSLY THE FACTS OF HIS DEFECTION HAD BECOME KNOWN LEAVING HIM OPEN TO ALMOST UNANSWERABLE ATTACK BY THOSE WHO OPPOSED HIS VIEWS
LJ044-0138 IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE TO HAVE FOLLOWED ARNOLD JOHNSON'S ADVICE TO REMAIN IN THE BACKGROUND
LJ044-0139 SINCE THERE WAS NO BACKGROUND TO THE NEW ORLEANS FPCC QUOTE ORGANIZATION END QUOTE WHICH CONSISTED SOLELY OF OSWALD
LJ044-0140 FURTHERMORE HE HAD APPARENTLY NOT RECEIVED ANY LETTERS FROM THE NATIONAL HEADQUARTERS OF FPCC SINCE MAY 29 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ044-0141 EVEN THOUGH HE HAD WRITTEN FOUR DETAILED LETTERS SINCE THAT TIME TO MR. V. T. LEE AND HAD ALSO KEPT THE NATIONAL HEADQUARTERS INFORMED
LJ044-0142 OF EACH OF HIS CHANGES OF MAILING ADDRESS
LJ044-0143 THOSE EVENTS NO DOUBT HAD THEIR EFFECTS ON OSWALD
LJ044-0144 INTEREST IN CUBA
LJ044-0145 BY AUGUST OF NINETEEN SIXTY THREE OSWALD HAD FOR SOME TIME BEEN CONSIDERING THE POSSIBILITY OF LEAVING THE UNITED STATES AGAIN
LJ044-0146 ON JUNE TWENTY FOUR NINETEEN SIXTY THREE HE APPLIED FOR A NEW PASSPORT
LJ044-0147 AND IN LATE JUNE OR EARLY JULY HE TOLD HIS WIFE THAT HE WANTED TO RETURN TO THE SOVIET UNION WITH HER SHE SAID THAT HE WAS EXTREMELY UPSET
LJ044-0148 VERY UNHAPPY AND THAT HE ACTUALLY WEPT WHEN HE TOLD HER THAT
LJ044-0149 HE SAID THAT NOTHING KEPT HIM IN THE UNITED STATES THAT HE WOULD NOT LOSE ANYTHING IF HE RETURNED TO THE SOVIET UNION THAT HE WANTED TO BE WITH HER
LJ044-0150 AND THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO HAVE LESS AND NOT HAVE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT TOMORROW
LJ044-0151 AS A RESULT OF THAT CONVERSATION MARINA OSWALD WROTE THE SOVIET EMBASSY IN WASHINGTON CONCERNING A REQUEST SHE HAD FIRST MADE
LJ044-0152 ON FEBRUARY 17 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE FOR PERMISSION FOR HERSELF AND JUNE TO RETURN TO THE SOVIET UNION
LJ044-0153 WHILE THAT FIRST REQUEST MADE ACCORDING TO MARINA OSWALD AT HER HUSBAND'S INSISTENCE SPECIFICALLY STATED THAT OSWALD WAS TO REMAIN IN THE UNITED STATES
LJ044-0154 SHE WROTE IN HER LETTER OF JULY NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ044-0155 THAT THINGS ARE IMPROVING DUE TO THE FACT THAT MY HUSBAND EXPRESSES A SINCERE WISH TO RETURN TOGETHER WITH ME TO THE USSR. UNKNOWN TO HIS WIFE HOWEVER
LJ044-0156 OSWALD APPARENTLY ENCLOSED A NOTE WITH HER LETTER OF JULY IN WHICH
LJ044-0157 HE REQUESTED THE EMBASSY TO RUSH HIS WIFE'S ENTRANCE VISA BECAUSE OF THE IMPENDING BIRTH OF THE SECOND CHILD BUT STATED THAT QUOTE
LJ044-0158 AS FOR MY RETURN ENTRANCE VISA PLEASE CONSIDER IT SEPARATELY. END QUOTE
LJ044-0159 THUS WHILE OSWALD'S REAL INTENTIONS ASSUMING THAT THEY WERE KNOWN TO HIMSELF ARE NOT CLEAR
LJ044-0160 HE MAY NOT HAVE INTENDED TO GO TO THE SOVIET UNION DIRECTLY IF AT ALL IT APPEARS THAT HE REALLY WANTED TO GO TO CUBA
LJ044-0161 IN HIS WIFE'S WORDS QUOTE
LJ044-0162 I ONLY KNOW THAT HIS BASIC DESIRE WAS TO GET TO CUBA BY ANY MEANS AND THAT ALL THE REST OF IT WAS WINDOW DRESSING FOR THAT PURPOSE. END QUOTE
LJ044-0163 MARINA OSWALD TESTIFIED THAT HER HUSBAND ENGAGED IN FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES QUOTE
LJ044-0164 PRIMARILY FOR PURPOSES OF SELFADVERTISING
LJ044-0165 HE WANTED TO BE ARRESTED I THINK HE WANTED TO GET INTO THE NEWSPAPERS SO THAT HE WOULD BE KNOWN. END QUOTE
LJ044-0166 ACCORDING TO MARINA OSWALD HE THOUGHT THAT WOULD HELP HIM WHEN HE GOT TO CUBA
LJ044-0167 HE ASKED HIS WIFE TO HELP HIM TO HIJACK AN AIRPLANE TO GET THERE BUT GAVE UP THAT SCHEME WHEN SHE REFUSED
LJ044-0168 DURING THIS PERIOD OSWALD MAY HAVE PRACTICED OPENING AND CLOSING THE BOLT ON HIS RIFLE IN A SCREENED PORCH IN HIS APARTMENT
LJ044-0169 IN SEPTEMBER HE BEGAN TO REVIEW SPANISH
LJ044-0170 HE APPROVED ARRANGEMENTS FOR HIS FAMILY TO RETURN TO IRVING TEXAS TO LIVE WITH MRS. RUTH PAINE
LJ044-0171 ON SEPTEMBER 20 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE MRS. PAINE AND HER TWO CHILDREN ARRIVED IN NEW ORLEANS FROM A TRIP TO THE EAST COAST
LJ044-0172 AND LEFT FOR IRVING WITH MARINA OSWALD AND JUNE AND MOST OF THE OSWALDS' EFFECTS 3 DAYS LATER
LJ044-0173 WHILE MARINA OSWALD KNEW OF HER HUSBAND'S PLAN TO GO TO MEXICO AND THENCE TO CUBA IF POSSIBLE MRS. PAINE WAS TOLD THAT OSWALD WAS GOING TO HOUSTON
LJ044-0174 AND POSSIBLY TO PHILADELPHIA TO LOOK FOR WORK
LJ044-0175 OSWALD LEFT FOR MEXICO CITY ON SEPTEMBER 25 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE AND ARRIVED ON SEPTEMBER 27 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ044-0176 HE WENT ALMOST DIRECTLY TO THE CUBAN EMBASSY AND APPLIED FOR A VISA TO CUBA IN TRANSIT TO RUSSIA
LJ044-0177 REPRESENTING HIMSELF AS THE HEAD OF THE NEW ORLEANS BRANCH OF THE QUOTE ORGANIZATION CALLED FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA END QUOTE
LJ044-0178 HE STATED HIS DESIRE THAT HE SHOULD BE ACCEPTED AS A FRIEND OF THE CUBAN REVOLUTION
LJ044-0179 HE APPARENTLY BASED HIS CLAIM FOR A VISA IN TRANSIT TO RUSSIA
LJ044-0180 ON HIS PREVIOUS RESIDENCE HIS WORK PERMIT FOR THAT COUNTRY AND SEVERAL UNIDENTIFIED LETTERS IN THE RUSSIAN LANGUAGE
LJ044-0181 THE CUBANS WOULD NOT HOWEVER GIVE HIM A VISA UNTIL HE HAD RECEIVED ONE FROM THE SOVIETS WHICH INVOLVED A DELAY OF SEVERAL MONTHS
LJ044-0182 WHEN FACED WITH THAT SITUATION OSWALD BECAME GREATLY AGITATED AND ALTHOUGH HE LATER UNSUCCESSFULLY ATTEMPTED
LJ044-0183 TO OBTAIN A SOVIET VISA AT THE SOVIET EMBASSY IN MEXICO CITY HE INSISTED THAT HE WAS ENTITLED TO THE CUBAN VISA BECAUSE OF HIS BACKGROUND
LJ044-0184 PARTISANSHIP AND PERSONAL ACTIVITIES ON BEHALF OF THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT
LJ044-0185 HE ENGAGED IN AN ANGRY ARGUMENT WITH THE CONSUL WHO FINALLY TOLD HIM THAT QUOTE AS FAR AS HE WAS CONCERNED
LJ044-0186 HE WOULD NOT GIVE HIM A VISA END QUOTE AND THAT QUOTE
LJ044-0187 A PERSON LIKE HIM OSWALD IN PLACE OF AIDING THE CUBAN REVOLUTION WAS DOING IT HARM END QUOTE
LJ044-0188 OSWALD MUST HAVE BEEN THOROUGHLY DISILLUSIONED WHEN HE LEFT MEXICO CITY ON OCTOBER 2 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ044-0189 IN SPITE OF HIS FORMER RESIDENCE IN THE SOVIET UNION AND HIS FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES HE HAD BEEN REBUFFED
LJ044-0190 BY THE OFFICIALS OF BOTH CUBA AND THE SOVIET UNION IN MEXICO CITY
LJ044-0191 NOW THERE APPEARED TO BE NO CHANCE TO GET TO CUBA WHERE HE HAD THOUGHT HE MIGHT FIND HIS COMMUNIST IDEAL. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT PERMIT TRAVEL THERE
LJ044-0192 AND AS FAR AS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CUBANS THEMSELVES WAS CONCERNED HE WAS QUOTE DISAPPOINTED AT NOT BEING ABLE TO GET TO CUBA
LJ044-0193 AND HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY GREAT DESIRE TO DO SO ANY MORE BECAUSE HE HAD RUN INTO AS HE HIMSELF SAID  INTO BUREAUCRACY AND RED TAPE END QUOTE
LJ044-0194 OSWALD'S ATTEMPT TO GO TO CUBA
LJ044-0195 WAS ANOTHER ACT WHICH EXPRESSED HIS HOSTILITY TOWARD THE UNITED STATES AND ITS INSTITUTIONS AS WELL AS A CONCOMITANT ATTACHMENT
LJ044-0196 TO A COUNTRY IN WHICH HE MUST HAVE THOUGHT WERE EMBODIED THE POLITICAL PRINCIPLES TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN COMMITTED FOR SO LONG
LJ044-0197 IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT HIS INTEREST IN CUBA SEEMS TO HAVE INCREASED ALONG WITH THE SENSE OF FRUSTRATION WHICH MUST HAVE DEVELOPED
LJ044-0198 AS HE EXPERIENCED SUCCESSIVE FAILURES IN HIS JOBS IN HIS POLITICAL ACTIVITY AND IN HIS PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS
LJ044-0199 IN RETROSPECT HIS ATTEMPT TO GO TO CUBA OR RETURN TO THE SOVIET UNION MAY WELL HAVE BEEN OSWALD'S LAST ESCAPE HATCH
LJ044-0200 HIS LAST GAMBIT TO EXTRICATE HIMSELF FROM THE MEDIOCRITY AND DEFEAT WHICH PLAGUED HIM THROUGHOUT MOST OF HIS LIFE
LJ044-0201 OSWALD'S ACTIVITIES WITH REGARD TO CUBA RAISE SERIOUS QUESTIONS AS TO HOW MUCH HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN MOTIVATED IN THE ASSASSINATION
LJ044-0202 BY A DESIRE TO AID THE CASTRO REGIME WHICH PRESIDENT KENNEDY SO OUTSPOKENLY CRITICIZED
LJ044-0203 FOR EXAMPLE THE DALLAS TIMES HERALD OF NOVEMBER 19 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ044-0204 PROMINENTLY REPORTED PRESIDENT KENNEDY AS HAVING QUOTE ALL BUT INVITED THE CUBAN PEOPLE TODAY TO OVERTHROW FIDEL CASTRO'S COMMUNIST REGIME
LJ044-0205 AND PROMISED PROMPT U.S. AID IF THEY DO END QUOTE
LJ044-0206 THE CASTRO REGIME SEVERELY ATTACKED PRESIDENT KENNEDY IN CONNECTION WITH THE BAY OF PIGS AFFAIR THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS THE BAN ON TRAVEL TO CUBA
LJ044-0207 THE ECONOMIC EMBARGO AGAINST THAT COUNTRY AND THE GENERAL POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES WITH REGARD TO CUBA
LJ044-0208 AN EXAMINATION OF THE MILITANT TO WHICH OSWALD SUBSCRIBED
LJ044-0209 FOR THE 3MONTH PERIOD PRIOR TO THE ASSASSINATION REFLECTS AN EXTREMELY CRITICAL ATTITUDE TOWARD PRESIDENT KENNEDY AND HIS ADMINISTRATION
LJ044-0210 CONCERNING CUBAN POLICY IN GENERAL AS WELL AS ON THE ISSUES OF AUTOMATION AND CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUES WHICH APPEARED TO CONCERN OSWALD A GREAT DEAL
LJ044-0211 THE MILITANT ALSO REFLECTED A CRITICAL ATTITUDE TOWARD PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S ATTEMPTS TO REDUCE TENSIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET UNION
LJ044-0212 IT ALSO DEALT WITH THE FEAR OF THE CASTRO REGIME THAT SUCH A POLICY MIGHT RESULT IN ITS ABANDONMENT BY THE SOVIET UNION
LJ044-0213 THE OCTOBER 7 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE ISSUE OF THE MILITANT
LJ044-0214 REPORTED CASTRO AS SAYING CUBA COULD NOT ACCEPT A SITUATION WHERE AT THE SAME TIME THE UNITED STATES WAS TRYING TO EASE WORLD TENSIONS
LJ044-0215 IT ALSO WAS INCREASING ITS EFFORTS TO TIGHTEN THE NOOSE AROUND CUBA
LJ044-0217 WAS ALSO REPORTED IN THE OCTOBER ONE NINETEEN SIXTY THREE ISSUE OF THE WORKER TO WHICH OSWALD ALSO SUBSCRIBED
LJ044-0218 IN THIS CONNECTION IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT IN SPEAKING OF THE WORKER OSWALD TOLD MICHAEL PAINE APPARENTLY IN ALL SERIOUSNESS THAT QUOTE
LJ044-0219 YOU COULD TELL WHAT THEY WANTED YOU TO DO BY READING BETWEEN THE LINES READING THE THING AND DOING A LITTLE READING BETWEEN THE LINES END QUOTE
LJ044-0220 THE GENERAL CONFLICT OF VIEWS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND CUBA WAS OF COURSE REFLECTED IN OTHER MEDIA TO SUCH AN EXTENT
LJ044-0221 THAT THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT OSWALD WAS AWARE GENERALLY OF THE CRITICAL ATTITUDE THAT CASTRO EXPRESSED ABOUT PRESIDENT KENNEDY
LJ044-0222 OSWALD WAS ASKED DURING THE NEW ORLEANS RADIO DEBATE IN WHICH HE ENGAGED ON AUGUST TWENTY ONE NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ044-0223 WHETHER OR NOT HE AGREED WITH CASTRO THAT PRESIDENT KENNEDY WAS A QUOTE RUFFIAN AND A THIEF END QUOTE. HE REPLIED THAT HE QUOTE
LJ044-0224 WOULD NOT AGREE WITH THAT PARTICULAR WORDING END QUOTE
LJ044-0225 IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED HOWEVER THAT ONE WITNESS TESTIFIED THAT SHORTLY BEFORE THE ASSASSINATION
LJ044-0226 OSWALD HAD EXPRESSED APPROVAL OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S ACTIVE ROLE IN THE AREA OF CIVIL RIGHTS
LJ044-0227 ALTHOUGH OSWALD COULD POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN MOTIVATED IN PART BY HIS SYMPATHY FOR THE CASTRO GOVERNMENT
LJ044-0228 IT SHOULD BE REMEMBERED THAT HIS WIFE TESTIFIED THAT HE WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH HIS FAILURE TO GET TO CUBA
LJ044-0229 AND HAD LOST HIS DESIRE TO DO SO BECAUSE OF THE BUREAUCRACY AND RED TAPE WHICH HE HAD ENCOUNTERED
LJ044-0230 HIS UNHAPPY EXPERIENCE WITH THE CUBAN CONSUL SEEMS THUS TO HAVE REDUCED HIS ENTHUSIASM FOR THE CASTRO REGIME AND HIS DESIRE TO GO TO CUBA
LJ044-0231 WHILE SOME OF CASTRO'S MORE SEVERE CRITICISMS OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY MIGHT HAVE LED OSWALD TO BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD BE WELL RECEIVED IN CUBA
LJ044-0232 AFTER HE HAD ASSASSINATED THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT HE HAD ANY PLANS TO GO THERE
LJ044-0233 OSWALD WAS CARRYING ONLY $13.87 AT THE TIME OF HIS ARREST ALTHOUGH HE HAD LEFT APPARENTLY BY DESIGN
LJ044-0234 $170 IN A WALLET IN HIS WIFE'S ROOM IN IRVING
LJ044-0235 IF THERE WAS NO CONSPIRACY WHICH WOULD HELP HIM ESCAPE THE POSSIBILITY OF WHICH HAS BEEN CONSIDERED IN CHAPTER 6
LJ044-0236 IT IS UNLIKELY THAT A REASONING PERSON WOULD PLAN TO ATTEMPT TO TRAVEL FROM DALLAS TEXAS TO CUBA
LJ044-0237 WITH $13.87 WHEN CONSIDERABLY GREATER RESOURCES WERE AVAILABLE TO HIM
LJ044-0238 THE FACT THAT OSWALD LEFT BEHIND THE FUNDS WHICH MIGHT HAVE ENABLED HIM TO REACH CUBA SUGGESTS THE ABSENCE OF ANY PLAN TO TRY TO FLEE THERE
LJ044-0239 AND RAISES SERIOUS QUESTIONS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT HE EVER EXPECTED TO ESCAPE
LJ045-0001 REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION ON THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY. THE WARREN COMMISSION REPORT. BY THE PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION ON THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY
LJ045-0002 CHAPTER 7. LEE HARVEY OSWALD BACKGROUND AND POSSIBLE MOTIVES PART 6
LJ045-0003 POSSIBLE INFLUENCE OF ANTIKENNEDY SENTIMENT IN DALLAS
LJ045-0004 IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT ONE OF THE MOTIVATING INFLUENCES OPERATING ON LEE OSWALD WAS THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE CITY OF DALLAS
LJ045-0005 ESPECIALLY AN ATMOSPHERE OF EXTREME OPPOSITION TO PRESIDENT KENNEDY THAT WAS PRESENT IN SOME PARTS OF THE DALLAS COMMUNITY
LJ045-0006 AND WHICH RECEIVED PUBLICITY THERE PRIOR TO THE ASSASSINATION
LJ045-0007 SOME OF THAT FEELING WAS EXPRESSED IN THE INCIDENT INVOLVING THEN VICEPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE JOHNSON DURING THE NINETEEN SIXTY CAMPAIGN
LJ045-0008 IN THE TREATMENT OF AMBASSADOR ADLAI STEVENSON LATE IN OCTOBER OF NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ045-0009 AND IN THE EXTREME ANTIKENNEDY NEWSPAPER ADVERTISEMENT AND HANDBILLS THAT APPEARED IN DALLAS AT THE TIME OF THE PRESIDENT'S VISIT THERE
LJ045-0010 THE COMMISSION HAS FOUND NO EVIDENCE THAT THE EXTREME VIEWS EXPRESSED TOWARD PRESIDENT KENNEDY
LJ045-0011 BY SOME RIGHTWING GROUPS CENTERED IN DALLAS OR ANY OTHER GENERAL ATMOSPHERE OF HATE
LJ045-0012 OR RIGHTWING EXTREMISM WHICH MAY HAVE EXISTED IN THE CITY OF DALLAS HAD ANY CONNECTION WITH OSWALD'S ACTIONS ON NOVEMBER 22 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ045-0013 THERE IS OF COURSE NO WAY TO JUDGE WHAT THE EFFECT OF THE GENERAL POLITICAL FERMENT PRESENT IN THAT CITY MIGHT HAVE BEEN EVEN THOUGH OSWALD WAS AWARE OF IT
LJ045-0014 HIS AWARENESS IS SHOWN BY A LETTER THAT HE WROTE TO ARNOLD JOHNSON OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY U.S.A.
LJ045-0015 WHICH JOHNSON SAID HE DID NOT RECEIVE UNTIL AFTER THE ASSASSINATION. THE LETTER SAID IN PART QUOTE
LJ045-0016 ON OCTOBER 23RD I HAD ATTENDED A ULTRARIGHT MEETING HEADED BY GENERAL EDWIN A. WALKER WHO LIVES IN DALLAS
LJ045-0017 THIS MEETING PRECEDED BY ONE DAY THE ATTACK ON A. E. STEVENSON AT THE UNITED NATIONS DAY MEETING AT WHICH HE SPOKE
LJ045-0018 AS YOU CAN SEE POLITICAL FRICTION BETWEEN LEFT AND RIGHT IS VERY GREAT HERE
LJ045-0019 COULD YOU ADVISE ME AS TO THE GENERAL VIEW WE HAVE ON THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION END QUOTE
LJ045-0020 IN ANY EVENT THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN UNABLE TO FIND ANY CREDIBLE EVIDENCE THAT OSWALD HAD DIRECT CONTACT OR ASSOCIATION WITH
LJ045-0021 ANY OF THE PERSONALITIES OR GROUPS EPITOMIZING OR REPRESENTING THE SOCALLED RIGHT WING
LJ045-0022 EVEN THOUGH HE DID AS HE TOLD JOHNSON ATTEND A MEETING AT WHICH GENERAL WALKER SPOKE TO APPROXIMATELY 1300 PERSONS
LJ045-0023 OSWALD'S WRITINGS AND HIS READING HABITS INDICATE THAT HE HAD AN EXTREME DISLIKE OF THE RIGHT WING AN ATTITUDE MOST CLEARLY REFLECTED BY HIS ATTEMPT
LJ045-0024 TO SHOOT GENERAL WALKER
LJ045-0025 RELATIONSHIP WITH WIFE
LJ045-0026 THE RELATIONS BETWEEN LEE AND MARINA OSWALD ARE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE IN ANY ATTEMPT TO UNDERSTAND OSWALD'S POSSIBLE MOTIVATION
LJ045-0027 DURING THE PERIOD FROM OSWALD'S RETURN FROM MEXICO TO THE ASSASSINATION
LJ045-0028 HE AND HIS WIFE SPENT EVERY WEEKEND BUT ONE TOGETHER AT THE IRVING TEXAS HOME OF MRS. RUTH PAINE WHO WAS THEN SEPARATED FROM HER HUSBAND
LJ045-0029 THE SOLE EXCEPTION WAS THE WEEKEND OF NOVEMBER SIXTEEN TO SEVENTEEN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE THE WEEKEND BEFORE THE ASSASSINATION
LJ045-0030 WHEN HIS WIFE ASKED OSWALD NOT TO COME TO IRVING
LJ045-0031 DURING THE WEEK OSWALD LIVED IN A ROOMINGHOUSE IN DALLAS BUT HE USUALLY CALLED HIS WIFE ON THE TELEPHONE TWICE A DAY
LJ045-0032 SHE TESTIFIED THAT AFTER HIS RETURN FROM MEXICO OSWALD QUOTE CHANGED FOR THE BETTER
LJ045-0033 HE BEGAN TO TREAT ME BETTER. HE HELPED ME MORE  ALTHOUGH HE ALWAYS DID HELP. BUT HE WAS MORE ATTENTIVE END QUOTE
LJ045-0034 MARINA OSWALD ATTRIBUTED THAT TO THEIR LIVING APART AND TO THE IMMINENT BIRTH OF THEIR SECOND CHILD
LJ045-0035 SHE TESTIFIED THAT OSWALD QUOTE WAS VERY HAPPY END QUOTE ABOUT THE BIRTH OF THE CHILD
LJ045-0036 WHILE THOSE CONSIDERATIONS NO DOUBT HAD AN EFFECT ON OSWALD'S ATTITUDE TOWARD HIS FAMILY IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE NEED FOR SUPPORT AND SYMPATHY
LJ045-0037 AFTER HIS RECENT REBUFFS IN MEXICO CITY
LJ045-0038 MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT TO HIM. IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TIME THAT OSWALD SOUGHT CLOSER TIES WITH HIS FAMILY IN TIME OF ADVERSITY
LJ045-0039 HIS PAST RELATIONSHIPS WITH HIS WIFE HAD BEEN STORMY HOWEVER AND IT DID NOT SEEM THAT SHE RESPECTED HIM VERY MUCH
LJ045-0040 THEY HAD BEEN MARRIED AFTER A COURTSHIP OF ONLY ABOUT 6 WEEKS A PART OF WHICH OSWALD SPENT IN THE HOSPITAL
LJ045-0041 OSWALD'S DIARY REPORTS THAT HE MARRIED HIS WIFE SHORTLY AFTER HIS PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE TO ANOTHER GIRL HAD BEEN REJECTED
LJ045-0042 HE STATED THAT THE OTHER GIRL REJECTED HIM PARTLY BECAUSE HE WAS AN AMERICAN A FACT THAT HE SAID SHE HAD EXPLOITED. HE STATED THAT QUOTE
LJ045-0043 IN SPITE OF FACT I MARRIED MARINA TO HURT ELLA THE GIRL THAT HAD REJECTED HIM I FOUND MYSELF IN LOVE WITH MARINA END QUOTE
LJ045-0044 MANY OF THE PEOPLE WITH WHOM THE OSWALDS BECAME ACQUAINTED AFTER THEIR ARRIVAL IN THE UNITED STATES THOUGHT THAT MARINA OSWALD HAD MARRIED HER HUSBAND PRIMARILY IN THE HOPE
LJ045-0045 THAT SHE WOULD BE ABLE TO LEAVE THE SOVIET UNION. MARINA OSWALD HAS DENIED THIS
LJ045-0046 MARINA OSWALD EXPRESSED ONE ASPECT OF HER HUSBAND'S ATTITUDE TOWARD HER WHEN SHE TESTIFIED THAT QUOTE LEE WANTED ME TO GO TO RUSSIA
LJ045-0047 AND I TOLD HIM THAT
LJ045-0048 IF HE WANTED ME TO GO THEN THAT MEANT THAT HE DIDN'T LOVE ME AND THAT IN THAT CASE WHAT WAS THE IDEA OF COMING TO THE UNITED STATES IN THE FIRST PLACE
LJ045-0049 LEE WOULD SAY THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR ME IF I WENT TO RUSSIA. I DID NOT KNOW WHY. I DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE HAD IN MIND
LJ045-0050 HE SAID HE LOVED ME BUT THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR ME IF I WENT TO RUSSIA AND WHAT HE HAD IN MIND I DON'T KNOW. END QUOTE
LJ045-0051 ON THE OTHER HAND OSWALD OBJECTED TO THE INVITATION THAT HIS WIFE HAD RECEIVED TO LIVE WITH MRS. RUTH PAINE
LJ045-0052 WHICH MRS. PAINE HAD MADE IN PART TO GIVE HER AN ALTERNATIVE TO RETURNING TO THE SOVIET UNION. MARINA OSWALD WROTE TO MRS. PAINE THAT QUOTE
LJ045-0053 MANY TIMES OSWALD HAS RECALLED THIS MATTER TO ME AND SAID THAT I AM JUST WAITING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO HURT HIM
LJ045-0054 IT HAS BEEN THE CAUSE OF MANY OF OUR ARGUMENTS. END QUOTE. OSWALD CLAIMED THAT HIS WIFE PREFERRED OTHERS TO HIM
LJ045-0055 HE SAID THIS ABOUT MEMBERS OF THE RUSSIANSPEAKING GROUP IN THE DALLASFT. WORTH AREA WHOM SHE SAID HE TRIED TO FORBID HER FROM SEEING
LJ045-0056 AND ALSO ABOUT MRS. PAINE
LJ045-0057 HE SPECIFICALLY MADE THAT CLAIM WHEN HIS WIFE REFUSED TO COME TO LIVE WITH HIM IN DALLAS AS HE ASKED HER TO DO ON THE EVENING OF NOVEMBER 21
LJ045-0058 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ045-0059 THE INSTABILITY OF THEIR RELATIONS WAS PROBABLY A FUNCTION OF THE PERSONALITIES OF BOTH PEOPLE. OSWALD WAS OVERBEARING IN RELATIONS WITH HIS WIFE
LJ045-0060 HE APPARENTLY ATTEMPTED TO BE THE COMMANDER BY DICTATING MANY OF THE DETAILS OF THEIR MARRIED LIFE
LJ045-0061 WHILE MARINA OSWALD SAID THAT HER HUSBAND WANTED HER TO LEARN ENGLISH
LJ045-0062 HE MADE NO ATTEMPT TO HELP HER AND THERE ARE OTHER INDICATIONS THAT HE DID NOT WANT HER TO LEARN THAT LANGUAGE
LJ045-0063 OSWALD APPARENTLY WISHED TO CONTINUE PRACTICING HIS OWN RUSSIAN WITH HER. LIEUTENANT MARTELLO OF THE NEW ORLEANS POLICE TESTIFIED
LJ045-0064 THAT OSWALD STATED THAT HE DID NOT SPEAK ENGLISH IN HIS FAMILY BECAUSE HE DID NOT WANT THEM TO BECOME AMERICANIZED
LJ045-0065 MARINA OSWALD'S INABILITY TO SPEAK ENGLISH ALSO MADE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR HER TO HAVE AN INDEPENDENT EXISTENCE IN THIS COUNTRY
LJ045-0066 OSWALD STRUCK HIS WIFE ON OCCASION
LJ045-0067 DID NOT WANT HER TO DRINK SMOKE OR WEAR COSMETICS AND GENERALLY TREATED HER WITH LACK OF RESPECT IN THE PRESENCE OF OTHERS
LJ045-0068 THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH OSWALD'S PROBLEMS WOULD HAVE CAUSED HIM IN ANY RELATIONSHIP WERE PROBABLY NOT REDUCED BY HIS WIFE'S CONDUCT
LJ045-0069 KATHERINE FORD WITH WHOM MARINA OSWALD STAYED DURING HER SEPARATION FROM HER HUSBAND IN NOVEMBER OF NINETEEN SIXTY TWO
LJ045-0070 THOUGHT THAT MARINA OSWALD WAS IMMATURE IN HER THINKING AND PARTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DIFFICULTIES THAT THE OSWALDS WERE HAVING AT THAT TIME
LJ045-0071 MRS. FORD SAID THAT MARINA OSWALD ADMITTED THAT SHE PROVOKED OSWALD ON OCCASION
LJ045-0072 THERE CAN BE LITTLE DOUBT THAT SOME PROVOCATION EXISTED
LJ045-0073 OSWALD ONCE STRUCK HIS WIFE BECAUSE OF A LETTER WHICH SHE WROTE TO A FORMER BOYFRIEND IN RUSSIA
LJ045-0074 IN THE LETTER MARINA OSWALD STATED THAT HER HUSBAND HAD CHANGED A GREAT DEAL AND THAT SHE WAS VERY LONELY IN THE UNITED STATES
LJ045-0075 SHE WAS QUOTE SORRY THAT I HAD NOT MARRIED HIM THE RUSSIAN BOYFRIEND INSTEAD THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH EASIER FOR ME END QUOTE
LJ045-0076 THE LETTER FELL INTO OSWALD'S HANDS WHEN IT WAS RETURNED TO HIS POST OFFICE BOX
LJ045-0077 BECAUSE OF INSUFFICIENT POSTAGE WHICH APPARENTLY RESULTED FROM AN INCREASE IN POSTAL RATES OF WHICH HIS WIFE HAD BEEN UNAWARE
LJ045-0078 OSWALD READ THE LETTER BUT REFUSED TO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS SINCERE EVEN THOUGH HIS WIFE INSISTED TO HIM THAT IT WAS
LJ045-0079 AS A RESULT OSWALD STRUCK HER AS TO WHICH SHE TESTIFIED QUOTE
LJ045-0080 GENERALLY I THINK THAT WAS RIGHT FOR SUCH THINGS THAT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO THERE WAS SOME GROUNDS FOR IT. END QUOTE
LJ045-0081 ALTHOUGH SHE DENIED IT IN SOME OF HER TESTIMONY BEFORE THE COMMISSION
LJ045-0082 IT APPEARS THAT MARINA OSWALD ALSO COMPLAINED THAT HER HUSBAND WAS NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE MORE MATERIAL THINGS FOR HER
LJ045-0083 ON THAT ISSUE GEORGE DE MOHRENSCHILDT WHO WAS PROBABLY AS CLOSE TO THE OSWALDS AS ANYONE ELSE DURING THEIR FIRST STAY IN DALLAS
LJ045-0084 SAID THAT QUOTE SHE WAS ANNOYING HIM ALL THE TIME
LJ045-0085 WHY DON'T YOU MAKE SOME MONEY POOR GUY WAS GOING OUT OF HIS MIND. WE TOLD HER SHE SHOULD NOT ANNOY HIM  POOR GUY HE IS DOING HIS BEST DON'T ANNOY HIM SO MUCH
LJ045-0086 THE DE MOHRENSCHILDTS ALSO TESTIFIED THAT QUOTE RIGHT IN FRONT END QUOTE OF OSWALD MARINA OSWALD COMPLAINED ABOUT OSWALD'S INADEQUACY AS A HUSBAND
LJ045-0087 MRS. OSWALD TOLD ANOTHER OF HER FRIENDS THAT OSWALD WAS VERY COLD TO HER THAT THEY VERY SELDOM HAD SEXUAL RELATIONS
LJ045-0088 AND THAT OSWALD QUOTE WAS NOT A MAN END QUOTE. SHE ALSO TOLD MRS. PAINE THAT SHE WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH HER SEXUAL RELATIONS WITH OSWALD
LJ045-0089 MARINA OSWALD ALSO RIDICULED HER HUSBAND'S POLITICAL VIEWS THEREBY TEARING DOWN HIS VIEW OF HIS OWN IMPORTANCE
LJ045-0090 HE WAS VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL WORKS OF OUTSTANDING STATESMEN OF THE UNITED STATES TO WHOM HIS WIFE THOUGHT HE COMPARED HIMSELF
LJ045-0091 SHE SAID HE WAS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER PEOPLE IN QUOTE AT LEAST HIS IMAGINATION HIS FANTASY WHICH WAS QUITE UNFOUNDED
LJ045-0092 AS TO THE FACT THAT HE WAS AN OUTSTANDING MAN END QUOTE
LJ045-0093 SHE SAID THAT SHE QUOTE ALWAYS TRIED TO POINT OUT TO HIM THAT HE WAS A MAN LIKE ANY OTHERS WHO WERE AROUND US. BUT HE SIMPLY COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THAT END QUOTE
LJ045-0094 JEANNE DE MOHRENSCHILDT HOWEVER THOUGHT THAT MARINA OSWALD QUOTE SAID THINGS THAT WILL HURT MEN'S PRIDE END QUOTE
LJ045-0095 SHE SAID THAT IF SHE EVER SPOKE TO HER HUSBAND THE WAY MARINA OSWALD SPOKE TO HER HUSBAND QUOTE WE WOULD NOT LAST LONG END QUOTE
LJ045-0096 MRS. DE MOHRENSCHILDT THOUGHT THAT OSWALD
LJ045-0097 WHOM SHE COMPARED TO QUOTE A PUPPY DOG THAT EVERYBODY KICKED END QUOTE HAD A LOT OF GOOD QUALITIES IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT QUOTE
LJ045-0098 NOBODY SAID ANYTHING GOOD ABOUT HIM END QUOTE
LJ045-0099 SHE HAD QUOTE THE IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS JUST PUSHED PUSHED PUSHED AND SHE MARINA OSWALD WAS PROBABLY NAGGING NAGGING NAGGING END QUOTE
LJ045-0100 SHE THOUGHT THAT HE MIGHT NOT HAVE BECOME INVOLVED IN THE ASSASSINATION IF PEOPLE HAD BEEN KINDER TO HIM
LJ045-0101 IN SPITE OF THESE DIFFICULTIES HOWEVER AND IN THE FACE OF THE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS THAT WERE ALWAYS WITH THEM
LJ045-0102 THINGS APPARENTLY WENT QUITE SMOOTHLY FROM THE TIME OSWALD RETURNED FROM MEXICO UNTIL THE WEEKEND OF NOVEMBER SIXTEEN TO SEVENTEEN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ045-0103 MRS. PAINE WAS PLANNING A BIRTHDAY PARTY FOR ONE OF HER CHILDREN ON THAT WEEKEND AND HER HUSBAND MICHAEL WAS TO BE AT THE HOUSE
LJ045-0104 MARINA OSWALD SAID THAT SHE KNEW HER HUSBAND DID NOT LIKE MICHAEL PAINE AND SO SHE ASKED HIM NOT TO COME OUT THAT WEEKEND EVEN THOUGH HE WANTED TO DO SO
LJ045-0105 SHE TESTIFIED THAT SHE TOLD HIM QUOTE
LJ045-0106 THAT HE SHOULDN'T COME EVERY WEEK THAT PERHAPS IT IS NOT CONVENIENT FOR RUTH THAT THE WHOLE FAMILY BE THERE LIVE THERE END QUOTE
LJ045-0107 SHE TESTIFIED THAT HE RESPONDED QUOTE AS YOU WISH IF YOU DON'T WANT ME TO COME I WON'T END QUOTE
LJ045-0108 RUTH PAINE TESTIFIED THAT SHE HEARD MARINA OSWALD TELL OSWALD ABOUT THE BIRTHDAY PARTY
LJ045-0109 ON SUNDAY NOVEMBER SEVENTEEN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ045-0110 RUTH PAINE AND MARINA OSWALD DECIDED TO CALL OSWALD AT THE PLACE WHERE HE WAS LIVING UNBEKNOWNST TO THEM UNDER THE NAME OF O. H. LEE
LJ045-0111 THEY ASKED FOR LEE OSWALD WHO WAS NOT CALLED TO THE TELEPHONE BECAUSE HE WAS KNOWN BY THE OTHER NAME
LJ045-0112 WHEN OSWALD CALLED THE NEXT DAY HIS WIFE BECAME VERY ANGRY ABOUT HIS USE OF THE ALIAS. HE SAID THAT HE USED IT BECAUSE QUOTE
LJ045-0113 HE DID NOT WANT HIS LANDLADY TO KNOW HIS REAL NAME BECAUSE SHE MIGHT READ IN THE PAPER OF THE FACT THAT HE HAD BEEN IN RUSSIA AND THAT HE HAD BEEN QUESTIONED END QUOTE
LJ045-0114 OSWALD ALSO SAID THAT HE DID NOT WANT THE FBI TO KNOW WHERE HE LIVED QUOTE BECAUSE THEIR VISITS WERE NOT VERY PLEASANT FOR HIM
LJ045-0115 AND HE THOUGHT THAT HE LOSES JOBS BECAUSE THE FBI VISITS THE PLACE OF HIS EMPLOYMENT END QUOTE
LJ045-0116 WHILE THE FACTS OF HIS DEFECTION HAD BECOME KNOWN IN NEW ORLEANS AS A RESULT OF HIS RADIO DEBATE WITH BRINGUIER
LJ045-0117 IT WOULD APPEAR TO BE UNLIKELY THAT HIS LANDLADY IN DALLAS
LJ045-0118 WOULD SEE ANYTHING IN THE NEWSPAPER ABOUT HIS DEFECTION UNLESS HE ENGAGED IN ACTIVITIES SIMILAR TO THOSE
LJ045-0119 WHICH HAD LED TO THE DISCLOSURE OF HIS DEFECTION IN NEW ORLEANS
LJ045-0120 FURTHERMORE EVEN THOUGH IT APPEARS THAT AT TIMES OSWALD WAS REALLY UPSET BY VISITS OF THE FBI
LJ045-0121 IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT HE EVER LOST HIS JOB BECAUSE OF ITS ACTIVITIES ALTHOUGH HE MAY WELL NOT HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THAT FACT
LJ045-0122 WHILE OSWALD'S CONCERN ABOUT THE FBI HAD SOME BASIS IN FACT IN THAT FBI AGENTS HAD INTERVIEWED HIM IN THE PAST AND HAD RENEWED THEIR INTEREST
LJ045-0123 TO SOME EXTENT AFTER HIS FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES HAD BECOME KNOWN HE EXAGGERATED THEIR CONCERN FOR HIM
LJ045-0124 MARINA OSWALD THOUGHT HE DID SO IN ORDER TO EMPHASIZE HIS IMPORTANCE
LJ045-0125 FOR EXAMPLE IN HIS LETTER OF NOVEMBER 9 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ045-0126 TO THE SOVIET EMBASSY IN WASHINGTON HE ASKED ABOUT THE ENTRANCE VISAS FOR WHICH HE AND HIS WIFE HAD PREVIOUSLY APPLIED
LJ045-0127 HE ABSOLVED THE SOVIET EMBASSY IN MEXICO CITY OF ANY BLAME FOR HIS DIFFICULTIES THERE. HE ADVISED THE WASHINGTON EMBASSY
LJ045-0128 THAT THE FBI WAS QUOTE NOT NOW END QUOTE INTERESTED IN HIS FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES BUT NOTED THAT THE FBI QUOTE
LJ045-0129 HAS VISITED US HERE IN DALLAS TEXAS ON NOVEMBER ONE AGENT JAMES P. HASTY
LJ045-0130 WARNED ME THAT IF I ENGAGED IN F.P.C.C. ACTIVITIES IN TEXAS THE F.B.I. WILL AGAIN TAKE AN INTEREST IN ME END QUOTE
LJ045-0131 NEITHER HOSTY NOR ANY OTHER AGENT OF THE FBI SPOKE TO OSWALD ON ANY SUBJECT FROM AUGUST TEN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ045-0132 TO THE TIME OF THE ASSASSINATION
LJ045-0133 THE CLAIMED WARNING WAS ONE MORE OF OSWALD'S FABRICATIONS
LJ045-0134 HOSTY HAD COME TO THE PAINE RESIDENCE ON NOVEMBER ONE AND 5 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ045-0135 BUT DID NOT ISSUE ANY SUCH WARNING OR SUGGEST THAT MARINA OSWALD DEFECT FROM THE SOVIET UNION AND REMAIN IN THE UNITED STATES UNDER FBI PROTECTION
LJ045-0136 AS OSWALD WENT ON TO SAY. IN OSWALD'S IMAGINATION QUOTE
LJ045-0137 I AND MY WIFE STRONGLY PROTESTED THESE TACTICS BY THE NOTORIOUS F.B.I. END QUOTE
LJ045-0138 IN FACT HIS WIFE TESTIFIED THAT SHE ONLY SAID THAT SHE WOULD PREFER NOT TO RECEIVE ANY MORE VISITS FROM THE BUREAU
LJ045-0139 BECAUSE OF THE QUOTE VERY EXCITING AND DISTURBING EFFECT END QUOTE THEY HAD UPON HER HUSBAND WHO WAS NOT EVEN PRESENT AT THAT TIME
LJ045-0140 THE ARGUMENTS HE USED TO JUSTIFY HIS USE OF THE ALIAS SUGGEST THAT OSWALD MAY HAVE COME TO THINK THAT THE WHOLE WORLD WAS BECOMING INVOLVED
LJ045-0141 IN AN INCREASINGLY COMPLEX CONSPIRACY AGAINST HIM
LJ045-0142 HE MAY HAVE FELT HE COULD NEVER TELL WHEN THE FBI WAS GOING TO APPEAR ON THE SCENE OR WHO ELSE WAS GOING TO FIND OUT ABOUT HIS DEFECTION
LJ045-0143 AND USE IT AGAINST HIM AS HAD BEEN DONE IN NEW ORLEANS
LJ045-0144 ON THE OTHER HAND THE CONCERN HE EXPRESSED ABOUT THE FBI MAY HAVE BEEN JUST ANOTHER STORY TO SUPPORT THE OBJECTIVE HE SOUGHT IN HIS LETTER
LJ045-0145 THOSE ARGUMENTS HOWEVER WERE NOT PERSUASIVE TO MARINA OSWALD
LJ045-0146 TO WHOM QUOTE IT WAS NOTHING TERRIBLE IF PEOPLE WERE TO FIND OUT THAT HE HAD BEEN IN RUSSIA END QUOTE
LJ045-0147 SHE ASKED OSWALD QUOTE
LJ045-0148 AFTER ALL WHEN WILL ALL YOUR FOOLISHNESS COME TO AN END ALL OF THESE COMEDIES. FIRST ONE THING AND THEN ANOTHER. AND NOW THIS FICTITIOUS NAME END QUOTE
LJ045-0149 SHE SAID QUOTE
LJ045-0150 ON MONDAY NOVEMBER EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE HE CALLED SEVERAL TIMES BUT AFTER I HUNG UP ON HIM AND DIDN'T WANT TO TALK TO HIM HE DID NOT CALL AGAIN
LJ045-0151 HE THEN ARRIVED ON THURSDAY NOVEMBER TWENTY ONE NINETEEN SIXTY THREE END QUOTE
LJ045-0152 THE EVENTS OF THAT EVENING CAN BEST BE APPRECIATED THROUGH MARINA OSWALD'S TESTIMONY
LJ045-0153 QUESTION DID YOUR HUSBAND GIVE ANY REASON FOR COMING HOME ON THURSDAY
LJ045-0154 ANSWER HE SAID THAT HE WAS LONELY BECAUSE HE HADN'T COME THE PRECEDING WEEKEND AND HE WANTED TO MAKE HIS PEACE WITH ME
LJ045-0155 QUESTION DID YOU SAY ANYTHING TO HIM THEN
LJ045-0156 ANSWER HE TRIED TO TALK TO ME BUT I WOULD NOT ANSWER HIM AND HE WAS VERY UPSET. QUESTION WERE YOU UPSET WITH HIM
LJ045-0157 ANSWER I WAS ANGRY OF COURSE HE WAS NOT ANGRY HE WAS UPSET I WAS ANGRY HE TRIED VERY HARD TO PLEASE ME
LJ045-0158 HE SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME PUTTING AWAY DIAPERS AND PLAYED WITH THE CHILDREN ON THE STREET
LJ045-0159 QUESTION HOW DID YOU INDICATE TO HIM THAT YOU WERE ANGRY WITH HIM ANSWER BY NOT TALKING TO HIM
LJ045-0160 QUESTION AND HOW DID HE SHOW THAT HE WAS UPSET
LJ045-0161 HE WAS UPSET OVER THE FACT THAT I WOULD NOT ANSWER HIM
LJ045-0162 HE TRIED TO START A CONVERSATION WITH ME SEVERAL TIMES BUT I WOULD NOT ANSWER. AND HE SAID THAT HE DIDN'T WANT ME TO BE ANGRY AT HIM BECAUSE THIS UPSETS HIM
LJ045-0163 ON THAT DAY HE SUGGESTED THAT WE RENT AN APARTMENT IN DALLAS
LJ045-0164 HE SAID THAT HE WAS TIRED OF LIVING ALONE AND PERHAPS THE REASON FOR MY BEING SO ANGRY WAS THE FACT THAT WE WERE NOT LIVING TOGETHER
LJ045-0165 THAT IF I WANT TO HE WOULD RENT AN APARTMENT IN DALLAS TOMORROW  THAT HE DIDN'T WANT ME TO REMAIN WITH RUTH ANY LONGER BUT WANTED ME TO LIVE WITH HIM IN DALLAS
LJ045-0166 HE REPEATED THIS NOT ONCE BUT SEVERAL TIMES BUT I REFUSED. AND HE SAID THAT ONCE AGAIN I WAS PREFERRING MY FRIENDS TO HIM AND THAT I DIDN'T NEED HIM
LJ045-0167 QUESTION WHAT DID YOU SAY TO THAT
LJ045-0168 ANSWER I SAID IT WOULD BE BETTER IF I REMAINED WITH RUTH UNTIL THE HOLIDAYS HE WOULD COME AND WE WOULD ALL MEET TOGETHER
LJ045-0169 THAT THIS WAS BETTER BECAUSE WHILE HE WAS LIVING ALONE AND I STAYED WITH RUTH WE WERE SPENDING LESS MONEY AND I TOLD HIM TO BUY ME A WASHING MACHINE BECAUSE TWO CHILDREN
LJ045-0170 IT BECAME TOO DIFFICULT TO WASH BY HAND
LJ045-0171 WHAT DID HE SAY TO THAT
LJ045-0172 ANSWER HE SAID HE WOULD BUY ME A WASHING MACHINE
LJ045-0173 QUESTION WHAT DID YOU SAY TO THAT ANSWER
LJ045-0174 THANK YOU THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER IF HE BOUGHT SOMETHING FOR HIMSELF  THAT I WOULD MANAGE END QUOTE THAT NIGHT OSWALD WENT TO BED BEFORE HIS WIFE RETIRED
LJ045-0175 SHE DID NOT SPEAK TO HIM WHEN SHE JOINED HIM THERE ALTHOUGH SHE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS STILL AWAKE
LJ045-0176 THE NEXT MORNING HE LEFT FOR WORK BEFORE ANYONE ELSE AROSE
LJ045-0177 FOR THE FIRST TIME
LJ045-0178 HE LEFT HIS WEDDING RING IN A CUP ON THE DRESSER IN HIS ROOM HE ALSO LEFT $170 IN A WALLET IN ONE OF THE DRESSER DRAWERS
LJ045-0179 HE TOOK WITH HIM $13.87 AND THE LONG BROWN PACKAGE THAT FRAZIER AND MRS. RANDLE SAW HIM CARRY
LJ045-0180 AND WHICH HE WAS TO TAKE TO THE SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY THE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS
LJ045-0181 NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW WHAT PASSED THROUGH OSWALD'S MIND DURING THE WEEK BEFORE NOVEMBER 22 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ045-0182 INSTEAD OF RETURNING TO IRVING ON NOVEMBER FIFTEEN FOR HIS CUSTOMARY WEEKEND VISIT HE REMAINED IN DALLAS AT HIS WIFE'S SUGGESTION BECAUSE OF THE BIRTHDAY PARTY
LJ045-0183 HE HAD ARGUED WITH HER OVER THE USE OF AN ALIAS AND HAD NOT CALLED HER AFTER THAT ARGUMENT ALTHOUGH HE USUALLY TELEPHONED ONCE OR TWICE A DAY
LJ045-0184 THEN ON THURSDAY MORNING NOVEMBER TWENTY ONE
LJ045-0185 HE ASKED FRAZIER FOR A RIDE TO IRVING THAT NIGHT STATING FALSELY THAT HE WANTED TO PICK UP SOME CURTAIN RODS TO PUT IN AN APARTMENT
LJ045-0186 HE MUST HAVE PLANNED HIS ATTACK AT THE VERY LATEST PRIOR TO THURSDAY MORNING WHEN HE SPOKE TO FRAZIER
LJ045-0187 THERE IS OF COURSE NO WAY TO DETERMINE THE DEGREE TO WHICH HE WAS COMMITTED TO HIS PLAN AT THAT TIME
LJ045-0188 WHILE THERE IS NO WAY TO TELL WHEN HE FIRST BEGAN TO THINK SPECIFICALLY OF ASSASSINATING THE PRESIDENT
LJ045-0189 IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT MENTION OF THE TRADE MART AS THE EXPECTED SITE OF THE PRESIDENTIAL LUNCHEON
LJ045-0190 APPEARED IN THE DALLAS TIMES HERALD ON NOVEMBER FIFTEEN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ045-0191 THE NEXT DAY THAT PAPER ANNOUNCED THE FINAL APPROVAL OF THE TRADE MART AS THE LUNCHEON SITE AND STATED THAT THE MOTORCADE QUOTE
LJ045-0192 APPARENTLY WILL LOOP THROUGH THE DOWNTOWN AREA PROBABLY ON MAIN STREET
LJ045-0193 EN ROUTE FROM DALLAS LOVE FIELD END QUOTE ON ITS WAY TO THE TRADE MART ON STEMMONS FREEWAY
LJ045-0194 ANYONE WHO WAS FAMILIAR WITH THAT AREA OF DALLAS WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT THE MOTORCADE WOULD PROBABLY PASS THE TEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY TO GET FROM MAIN STREET
LJ045-0195 ONTO THE STEMMONS FREEWAY
LJ045-0196 THAT FACT WAS MADE PRECISELY CLEAR IN SUBSEQUENT NEWS STORIES ON NOVEMBER NINETEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY TWO
LJ045-0197 ON NOVEMBER FIFTEEN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE THE SAME DAY THAT HIS WIFE TOLD HIM NOT TO COME TO IRVING OSWALD COULD HAVE ASSUMED
LJ045-0198 THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL MOTORCADE WOULD PASS IN FRONT OF HIS PLACE OF WORK
LJ045-0199 WHETHER HE THOUGHT ABOUT ASSASSINATING THE PRESIDENT OVER THE WEEKEND CAN NEVER BE KNOWN BUT IT IS REASONABLY CERTAIN
LJ045-0200 THAT OVER THE WEEKEND HE DID THINK ABOUT HIS WIFE'S REQUEST THAT HE NOT COME TO IRVING WHICH WAS PROMPTED BY THE BIRTHDAY PARTY BEING HELD AT THE PAINE HOME
LJ045-0201 OSWALD HAD A HIGHLY EXAGGERATED SENSE OF HIS OWN IMPORTANCE BUT HE HAD FAILED AT ALMOST EVERYTHING HE HAD EVER TRIED TO DO
LJ045-0202 HE HAD GREAT DIFFICULTY IN ESTABLISHING MEANINGFUL RELATIONS WITH OTHER PEOPLE. EXCEPT FOR HIS FAMILY HE WAS COMPLETELY ALONE
LJ045-0203 EVEN THOUGH HE HAD SEARCHED  IN THE MARINE CORPS IN HIS IDEAL OF COMMUNISM IN THE SOVIET UNION AND IN HIS ATTEMPT TO GET TO CUBA
LJ045-0204 HE HAD NEVER FOUND ANYTHING TO WHICH HE FELT HE COULD REALLY BELONG
LJ045-0205 AFTER HE RETURNED FROM HIS TRIP TO MEXICO WHERE HIS APPLICATION TO GO TO CUBA HAD BEEN SHARPLY REJECTED
LJ045-0206 IT MUST HAVE APPEARED TO HIM THAT HE WAS UNABLE TO COMMAND EVEN THE ATTENTION OF HIS FAMILY
LJ045-0207 HE COULD NOT KEEP THEM WITH HIM IN DALLAS WHERE AT LEAST HE COULD SEE HIS CHILDREN WHOM SEVERAL WITNESSES TESTIFIED HE SEEMED TO LOVE
LJ045-0208 HIS FAMILY LIVED WITH MRS. PAINE OSTENSIBLY BECAUSE OSWALD COULD NOT AFFORD TO KEEP AN APARTMENT IN DALLAS
LJ045-0209 BUT IT WAS ALSO AT LEAST IN PART BECAUSE HIS WIFE DID NOT WANT TO LIVE THERE WITH HIM
LJ045-0210 NOW IT APPEARED THAT HE WAS NOT WELCOME AT THE PAINE HOME
LJ045-0211 WHERE HE HAD SPENT EVERY PREVIOUS WEEKEND SINCE HIS RETURN FROM MEXICO AND HIS WIFE WAS ONCE AGAIN CALLING INTO QUESTION HIS JUDGMENT
LJ045-0212 THIS TIME CONCERNING HIS USE OF AN ALIAS
LJ045-0213 THE CONVERSATION ON MONDAY NOVEMBER EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ045-0214 ENDED WHEN MARINA OSWALD HUNG UP AND REFUSED TO TALK TO HIM. ALTHOUGH HE MAY LONG BEFORE HAVE DECIDED ON THE COURSE HE WAS TO FOLLOW
LJ045-0215 AND MAY HAVE TOLD HIS WIFE THE THINGS HE DID ON THE EVENING OF NOVEMBER TWENTY ONE
LJ045-0216 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE MERELY TO DISARM HER AND TO PROVIDE A JUSTIFICATION OF SORTS
LJ045-0217 BOTH SHE AND MRS. PAINE THOUGHT HE HAD COME HOME TO MAKE UP AFTER THE FIGHT ON MONDAY
LJ045-0218 THOUGHTS OF HIS PERSONAL DIFFICULTIES MUST HAVE BEEN AT LEAST PARTLY ON HIS MIND WHEN HE WENT TO IRVING ON THURSDAY NIGHT AND TOLD HIS WIFE THAT HE WAS LONELY
LJ045-0219 THAT HE WANTED TO MAKE PEACE WITH HER AND BRING HIS FAMILY TO DALLAS WHERE THEY COULD LIVE WITH HIM AGAIN
LJ045-0220 THE COMMISSION DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE RELATIONS BETWEEN OSWALD AND HIS WIFE CAUSED HIM TO ASSASSINATE THE PRESIDENT
LJ045-0221 IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE MOTIVATION WAS THAT SIMPLE
LJ045-0222 THE FEELINGS OF HOSTILITY AND AGGRESSION WHICH SEEM TO HAVE PLAYED SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART IN OSWALD'S LIFE
LJ045-0223 WERE PART OF HIS CHARACTER LONG BEFORE HE MET HIS WIFE
LJ045-0224 AND SUCH A FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITY TO STRIKE AT A FIGURE AS GREAT AS THE PRESIDENT WOULD PROBABLY NEVER HAVE COME TO HIM AGAIN
LJ045-0225 OSWALD'S BEHAVIOR AFTER THE ASSASSINATION THROWS LITTLE LIGHT ON HIS MOTIVES
LJ045-0226 THE FACT THAT HE TOOK SO LITTLE MONEY WITH HIM WHEN HE LEFT IRVING IN THE MORNING INDICATES THAT HE DID NOT EXPECT TO GET VERY FAR FROM DALLAS ON HIS OWN
LJ045-0227 AND SUGGESTS THE POSSIBILITY AS DID HIS NOTE TO HIS WIFE JUST PRIOR TO THE ATTEMPT ON GENERAL WALKER THAT HE DID NOT EXPECT TO ESCAPE AT ALL
LJ045-0228 ON THE OTHER HAND HE COULD HAVE TRAVELED SOME DISTANCE WITH THE MONEY HE DID HAVE AND HE DID RETURN TO HIS ROOM WHERE HE OBTAINED HIS REVOLVER
LJ045-0229 HE THEN KILLED PATROLMAN TIPPIT WHEN THAT POLICE OFFICER APPARENTLY TRIED TO QUESTION HIM AFTER HE HAD LEFT HIS ROOMINGHOUSE AND HE VIGOROUSLY RESISTED ARREST
LJ045-0230 WHEN HE WAS FINALLY APPREHENDED IN THE TEXAS THEATRE ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT FULLY CORROBORATED BY OTHERS WHO WERE PRESENT
LJ045-0231 TWO OFFICERS HAVE TESTIFIED THAT AT THE TIME OF HIS ARREST OSWALD SAID SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT THAT QUOTE IT'S ALL OVER NOW END QUOTE
LJ045-0232 OSWALD WAS OVERBEARING AND ARROGANT THROUGHOUT MUCH OF THE TIME BETWEEN HIS ARREST AND HIS OWN DEATH
LJ045-0233 HE CONSISTENTLY REFUSED TO ADMIT INVOLVEMENT IN THE ASSASSINATION OR IN THE KILLING OF PATROLMAN TIPPIT
LJ045-0234 WHILE HE DID BECOME ENRAGED AT AT LEAST ONE POINT IN HIS INTERROGATION
LJ045-0235 THE TESTIMONY OF THE OFFICERS PRESENT INDICATES THAT HE HANDLED HIMSELF WITH CONSIDERABLE COMPOSURE DURING HIS QUESTIONING
LJ045-0236 HE ADMITTED NOTHING THAT WOULD DAMAGE HIM BUT DISCUSSED OTHER MATTERS QUITE FREELY
LJ045-0237 HIS DENIALS UNDER QUESTIONING WHICH HAVE NO PROBATIVE VALUE IN VIEW OF THE MANY READILY DEMONSTRABLE LIES HE TOLD AT THAT TIME
LJ045-0238 AND IN THE FACE OF THE OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM
LJ045-0239 WHICH HAS BEEN SET FORTH ABOVE ONLY SERVED TO PROLONG THE PERIOD DURING WHICH HE WAS THE CENTER OF THE ATTENTION OF THE ENTIRE WORLD
LJ045-0240 MANY FACTORS WERE UNDOUBTEDLY INVOLVED IN OSWALD'S MOTIVATION FOR THE ASSASSINATION AND THE COMMISSION DOES NOT BELIEVE
LJ045-0241 THAT IT CAN ASCRIBE TO HIM ANY ONE MOTIVE OR GROUP OF MOTIVES
LJ045-0242 IT IS APPARENT HOWEVER THAT OSWALD WAS MOVED BY AN OVERRIDING HOSTILITY TO HIS ENVIRONMENT
LJ045-0243 HE DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ESTABLISH MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER PEOPLE. HE WAS PERPETUALLY DISCONTENTED WITH THE WORLD AROUND HIM
LJ045-0244 LONG BEFORE THE ASSASSINATION HE EXPRESSED HIS HATRED FOR AMERICAN SOCIETY AND ACTED IN PROTEST AGAINST IT
LJ045-0245 OSWALD'S SEARCH FOR WHAT HE CONCEIVED TO BE THE PERFECT SOCIETY WAS DOOMED FROM THE START
LJ045-0246 HE SOUGHT FOR HIMSELF A PLACE IN HISTORY  A ROLE AS THE GREAT MAN WHO WOULD BE RECOGNIZED AS HAVING BEEN IN ADVANCE OF HIS TIMES
LJ045-0247 HIS COMMITMENT TO MARXISM AND COMMUNISM APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN ANOTHER IMPORTANT FACTOR IN HIS MOTIVATION
LJ045-0248 HE ALSO HAD DEMONSTRATED A CAPACITY TO ACT DECISIVELY AND WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONSEQUENCES WHEN SUCH ACTION WOULD FURTHER HIS AIMS OF THE MOMENT
LJ045-0249 OUT OF THESE AND THE MANY OTHER FACTORS WHICH MAY HAVE MOLDED THE CHARACTER OF LEE HARVEY OSWALD
LJ045-0250 THERE EMERGED A MAN CAPABLE OF ASSASSINATING PRESIDENT KENNEDY
LJ046-0001 REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION ON THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY. THE WARREN COMMISSION REPORT BY
LJ046-0002 THE PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION ON THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY CHAPTER EIGHT THE PROTECTION OF THE PRESIDENT PART ONE
LJ046-0003 IN THE 100 YEARS SINCE EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE
LJ046-0004 FOUR PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN ASSASSINATED
LJ046-0005 ABRAHAM LINCOLN JAMES A. GARFIELD WILLIAM MCKINLEY AND JOHN F. KENNEDY
LJ046-0006 DURING THIS SAME PERIOD THERE WERE THREE OTHER ATTACKS ON THE LIFE OF A PRESIDENT
LJ046-0007 A PRESIDENTELECT AND A CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY WHICH NARROWLY FAILED
LJ046-0008 ON THEODORE ROOSEVELT WHILE CAMPAIGNING IN OCTOBER OF NINETEEN TWELVE ON PRESIDENTELECT FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT
LJ046-0009 WHEN VISITING MIAMI ON FEBRUARY FIFTEEN NINETEEN THIRTY THREE AND ON PRESIDENT HARRY S. TRUMAN ON NOVEMBER ONE NINETEEN FIFTY
LJ046-0010 WHEN HIS TEMPORARY RESIDENCE BLAIR HOUSE WAS ATTACKED BY PUERTO RICAN NATIONALISTS
LJ046-0011 ONE OUT OF EVERY FIVE PRESIDENTS SINCE EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE HAS BEEN ASSASSINATED
LJ046-0012 THERE HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTS ON THE LIVES OF ONE OUT OF EVERY THREE
LJ046-0013 PROMPTED BY THESE DISMAYING STATISTICS THE COMMISSION HAS INQUIRED INTO THE PROBLEMS AND METHODS OF PRESIDENTIAL PROTECTION IN EFFECT
LJ046-0014 AT THE TIME OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S ASSASSINATION
LJ046-0015 THIS STUDY HAS LED THE COMMISSION TO CONCLUDE THAT THE PUBLIC INTEREST MIGHT BE SERVED BY ANY CONTRIBUTION IT CAN MAKE TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF PROTECTIVE ARRANGEMENTS
LJ046-0016 THE COMMISSION HAS NOT UNDERTAKEN A COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATION OF ALL FACETS OF THIS SUBJECT
LJ046-0017 RATHER IT HAS DEVOTED ITS TIME AND RESOURCES TO THOSE BROADER ASPECTS OF PRESIDENTIAL PROTECTION
LJ046-0018 TO WHICH THE EVENTS OF LAST NOVEMBER CALLED ATTENTION
LJ046-0019 IN THIS PART OF ITS INQUIRY THE COMMISSION HAS HAD FULL ACCESS TO A MAJOR STUDY OF ALL PHASES OF PROTECTIVE ACTIVITIES
LJ046-0020 PREPARED BY THE SECRET SERVICE FOR THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY FOLLOWING THE ASSASSINATION AS A RESULT OF THIS STUDY
LJ046-0021 THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY HAS PREPARED A PLANNING DOCUMENT DATED AUGUST 27 NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR
LJ046-0022 WHICH RECOMMENDS ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL AND FACILITIES TO ENABLE THE SECRET SERVICE TO EXPAND ITS PROTECTION CAPABILITIES
LJ046-0023 THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY SUBMITTED THIS PLANNING DOCUMENT ON AUGUST THIRTY ONE NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR
LJ046-0024 TO THE BUREAU OF THE BUDGET FOR REVIEW AND APPROVAL
LJ046-0025 THIS PLANNING DOCUMENT HAS BEEN MADE A PART OF THE COMMISSION'S PUBLISHED RECORD THE UNDERLYING STAFF AND CONSULTANTS' REPORTS REVIEWED BY THE COMMISSION HAVE NOT
LJ046-0026 SINCE A DISCLOSURE OF SUCH DETAILED INFORMATION RELATING TO PROTECTIVE MEASURES MIGHT UNDERMINE PRESENT METHODS OF PROTECTING THE PRESIDENT
LJ046-0027 HOWEVER ALL INFORMATION CONSIDERED BY THE COMMISSION WHICH PERTAINS TO THE PROTECTIVE FUNCTION AS IT WAS CARRIED OUT IN DALLAS HAS BEEN PUBLISHED AS PART OF THIS REPORT
LJ046-0028 THE PROTECTION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS AN IMMENSELY DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX TASK
LJ046-0029 IT IS UNLIKELY THAT MEASURES CAN BE DEVISED TO ELIMINATE ENTIRELY THE MULTITUDE OF DIVERSE DANGERS THAT MAY ARISE
LJ046-0030 PARTICULARLY WHEN THE PRESIDENT IS TRAVELING IN THIS COUNTRY OR ABROAD
LJ046-0031 THE PROTECTIVE TASK IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE RELUCTANCE OF PRESIDENTS TO TAKE SECURITY PRECAUTIONS WHICH MIGHT INTERFERE WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF THEIR DUTIES
LJ046-0032 OR THEIR DESIRE TO HAVE FREQUENT AND EASY ACCESS TO THE PEOPLE
LJ046-0033 THE ADEQUACY OF EXISTING PROCEDURES CAN FAIRLY BE ASSESSED ONLY AFTER FULL CONSIDERATION OF THE DIFFICULTY OF THE PROTECTIVE ASSIGNMENT
LJ046-0034 WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE DIVERSE ROLES WHICH THE PRESIDENT IS EXPECTED TO FILL
LJ046-0035 AFTER REVIEWING THIS ASPECT OF THE MATTER THIS CHAPTER WILL SET FORTH THE COMMISSION'S CONCLUSIONS
LJ046-0036 REGARDING CERTAIN PROTECTIVE MEASURES IN FORCE AT THE TIME OF THE DALLAS TRIP AND PROPOSE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENTS
LJ046-0037 THE NATURE OF THE PROTECTIVE ASSIGNMENT
LJ046-0038 THE PRESIDENT IS HEAD OF STATE CHIEF EXECUTIVE COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND LEADER OF A POLITICAL PARTY
LJ046-0039 AS THE CEREMONIAL HEAD OF THE GOVERNMENT THE PRESIDENT MUST DISCHARGE A WIDE RANGE OF PUBLIC DUTIES NOT ONLY IN WASHINGTON BUT THROUGHOUT THE LAND
LJ046-0040 IN THIS ROLE HE APPEARS TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN THE WORDS OF WILLIAM HOWARD TAFT AS QUOTE
LJ046-0041 THE PERSONAL EMBODIMENT AND REPRESENTATIVE OF THEIR DIGNITY AND MAJESTY END QUOTE
LJ046-0042 AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE THE PRESIDENT CONTROLS THE EXERCISE OF THE VAST ALMOST INCALCULABLE POWERS OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
LJ046-0043 AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES HE MUST MAINTAIN ULTIMATE AUTHORITY OVER THE DEVELOPMENT AND DISPOSITION OF OUR MILITARY POWER
LJ046-0044 IN ACCORDANCE WITH GEORGE WASHINGTON'S MAXIM THAT AMERICANS HAVE A GOVERNMENT QUOTE OF ACCOMMODATION AS WELL AS A GOVERNMENT OF LAWS END QUOTE
LJ046-0045 IT IS THE PRESIDENT'S RIGHT AND DUTY TO BE THE ACTIVE LEADER OF HIS PARTY AS WHEN HE SEEKS TO BE REELECTED OR TO MAINTAIN HIS PARTY IN POWER
LJ046-0046 IN ALL OF THESE ROLES THE PRESIDENT MUST GO TO THE PEOPLE
LJ046-0047 EXPOSURE OF THE PRESIDENT TO PUBLIC VIEW THROUGH TRAVEL AMONG THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY IS A GREAT AND HISTORIC TRADITION OF AMERICAN LIFE
LJ046-0048 DESIRED BY BOTH THE PRESIDENT AND THE PUBLIC IT IS AN INDISPENSABLE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE TWO
LJ046-0049 MORE OFTEN THAN NOT PRESIDENTIAL JOURNEYS HAVE SERVED MORE THAN ONE PURPOSE AT THE SAME TIME CEREMONIAL
LJ046-0050 ADMINISTRATIVE POLITICAL
LJ046-0051 FROM GEORGE WASHINGTON TO JOHN F. KENNEDY SUCH JOURNEYS HAVE BEEN A NORMAL PART OF THE PRESIDENT'S ACTIVITIES
LJ046-0052 TO PROMOTE NATIONWIDE ACCEPTANCE OF HIS ADMINISTRATION WASHINGTON MADE GRAND TOURS THAT SERVED ALSO TO EXCITE INTEREST IN THE PRESIDENCY
LJ046-0053 IN RECENT YEARS PRESIDENTIAL JOURNEYS HAVE BEEN FREQUENT AND EXTENSIVE
LJ046-0054 PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE GREATER SPEED AND COMFORT OF TRAVEL AND PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE GREATER DEMANDS MADE ON THE PRESIDENT
LJ046-0055 IT IS NOW POSSIBLE FOR PRESIDENTS TO TRAVEL THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF A LAND FAR LARGER THAN THE UNITED STATES
LJ046-0056 IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY NINE IN LESS TIME THAN IT TOOK GEORGE WASHINGTON TO TRAVEL FROM NEW YORK TO MOUNT VERNON
LJ046-0057 OR THOMAS JEFFERSON FROM WASHINGTON TO MONTICELLO
LJ046-0058 DURING HIS PRESIDENCY FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT MADE ALMOST 400 JOURNEYS AND TRAVELED MORE THAN 350000 MILES
LJ046-0059 SINCE NINETEEN FORTY FIVE ROOSEVELT'S SUCCESSORS HAVE RANGED THE WORLD
LJ046-0060 AND THEIR FOREIGN JOURNEYS HAVE COME TO BE ACCEPTED AS NORMAL RATHER THAN EXTRAORDINARY
LJ046-0061 JOHN F. KENNEDY'S JOURNEY TO TEXAS IN NOVEMBER NINETEEN SIXTY THREE WAS IN THIS TRADITION
LJ046-0062 HIS FRIEND AND SPECIAL ASSISTANT KENNETH O'DONNELL WHO ACCOMPANIED HIM ON HIS LAST VISIT TO DALLAS
LJ046-0063 STATED THE PRESIDENT'S VIEWS OF HIS RESPONSIBILITIES WITH SIMPLICITY AND CLARITY QUOTE
LJ046-0064 THE PRESIDENT'S VIEWS OF HIS RESPONSIBILITIES AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WERE THAT HE MEET THE PEOPLE THAT HE GO OUT TO THEIR HOMES AND SEE THEM
LJ046-0065 AND ALLOW THEM TO SEE HIM AND DISCUSS IF POSSIBLE THE VIEWS OF THE WORLD AS HE SEES IT THE PROBLEMS OF THE COUNTRY AS HE SEES THEM
LJ046-0066 AND HE FELT THAT LEAVING WASHINGTON FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS A MOST NECESSARY  NOT ONLY FOR THE PEOPLE BUT FOR THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF
LJ046-0067 THAT HE EXPOSE HIMSELF TO THE ACTUAL BASIC PROBLEMS THAT WERE DISTURBING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
LJ046-0068 IT HELPED HIM IN HIS JOB HERE HE WAS ABLE TO COME BACK HERE WITH A FRESH VIEW OF MANY THINGS
LJ046-0069 I THINK HE FELT VERY STRONGLY THAT THE PRESIDENT OUGHT TO GET OUT OF WASHINGTON AND GO MEET THE PEOPLE ON A REGULAR BASIS. END QUOTE
LJ046-0070 WHATEVER THEIR PURPOSES PRESIDENTIAL JOURNEYS HAVE GREATLY ENLARGED AND COMPLICATED THE TASK OF PROTECTING THE PRESIDENT
LJ046-0071 THE SECRET SERVICE AND THE FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WHICH COOPERATE WITH IT
LJ046-0072 HAVE BEEN CONFRONTED IN RECENT YEARS WITH INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT PROBLEMS CREATED BY THE GREATER EXPOSURE OF THE PRESIDENT DURING HIS TRAVELS
LJ046-0073 AND THE GREATER DIVERSITY OF THE AUDIENCES HE MUST FACE IN A WORLD TORN BY CONFLICTING IDEOLOGIES
LJ046-0074 IF THE SOLE GOAL WERE TO PROTECT THE LIFE OF THE PRESIDENT IT COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED WITH REASONABLE ASSURANCE DESPITE THE MULTIPLE ROLES HE MUST PLAY
LJ046-0075 BUT HIS VERY POSITION AS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PEOPLE PREVENTS HIM FROM EFFECTIVELY SHIELDING HIMSELF FROM THE PEOPLE
LJ046-0076 HE CANNOT AND WILL NOT TAKE THE PRECAUTIONS OF A DICTATOR OR A SOVEREIGN
LJ046-0077 UNDER OUR SYSTEM MEASURES MUST BE SOUGHT TO AFFORD SECURITY WITHOUT IMPEDING THE PRESIDENT'S PERFORMANCE OF HIS MANY FUNCTIONS
LJ046-0078 THE PROTECTION OF THE PRESIDENT MUST BE THOROUGH BUT INCONSPICUOUS TO AVOID EVEN THE SUGGESTION OF A GARRISON STATE
LJ046-0079 THE RIGHTS OF PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS MUST NOT BE INFRINGED
LJ046-0080 IF THE PROTECTIVE JOB IS WELL DONE ITS PERFORMANCE WILL BE EVIDENT ONLY IN THE UNEXCEPTIONAL FACT OF ITS SUCCESS
LJ046-0081 THE MEN IN CHARGE OF PROTECTING THE PRESIDENT CONFRONTED BY COMPLEX PROBLEMS AND LIMITED AS THEY ARE IN THE MEASURES THEY MAY EMPLOY
LJ046-0082 MUST DEPEND UPON THE UTMOST COOPERATION AND UNDERSTANDING FROM THE PUBLIC AND THE PRESIDENT
LJ046-0083 THE PROBLEM AND THE REASONABLE APPROACH TO ITS SOLUTION WERE ABLY STATED IN A MEMORANDUM PREPARED BY FBI DIRECTOR J. EDGAR HOOVER
LJ046-0084 FOR THE PRESIDENT SOON AFTER THE ASSASSINATION QUOTE
LJ046-0085 THE DEGREE OF SECURITY THAT CAN BE AFFORDED THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
LJ046-0086 IS DEPENDENT TO A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT UPON THE DEGREE OF CONTACT WITH THE GENERAL PUBLIC DESIRED BY THE PRESIDENT
LJ046-0087 ABSOLUTE SECURITY IS NEITHER PRACTICAL NOR POSSIBLE. AN APPROACH TO COMPLETE SECURITY WOULD REQUIRE THE PRESIDENT
LJ046-0088 TO OPERATE IN A SORT OF VACUUM ISOLATED FROM THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND BEHIND IMPREGNABLE BARRIERS
LJ046-0089 HIS TRAVEL WOULD BE IN SECRET HIS PUBLIC APPEARANCES WOULD BE BEHIND BULLETPROOF GLASS. A MORE PRACTICAL APPROACH NECESSITATES COMPROMISE
LJ046-0090 ANY TRAVEL ANY CONTACT WITH THE GENERAL PUBLIC INVOLVES A CALCULATED RISK ON THE PART OF THE PRESIDENT AND THE MEN RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS PROTECTION
LJ046-0091 SUCH RISKS CAN BE LESSENED WHEN THE PRESIDENT RECOGNIZES THE SECURITY PROBLEM
LJ046-0092 HAS CONFIDENCE IN THE DEDICATED SECRET SERVICE MEN WHO ARE READY TO LAY DOWN THEIR LIVES FOR HIM
LJ046-0093 AND ACCEPTS THE NECESSARY SECURITY PRECAUTIONS WHICH THEY RECOMMEND
LJ046-0094 MANY PRESIDENTS HAVE BEEN UNDERSTANDABLY IMPATIENT WITH THE SECURITY PRECAUTIONS WHICH MANY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE DICTATE
LJ046-0095 BECAUSE THESE PRECAUTIONS REDUCE THE PRESIDENT'S PRIVACY AND THE ACCESS TO HIM OF THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY
LJ046-0096 NEVERTHELESS THE PROCEDURES AND ADVICE SHOULD BE ACCEPTED IF THE PRESIDENT WISHES TO HAVE ANY SECURITY
LJ046-0097 EVALUATION OF PRESIDENTIAL PROTECTION AT THE TIME OF THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY
LJ046-0098 THE HISTORY OF PRESIDENTIAL PROTECTION SHOWS GROWING RECOGNITION OVER THE YEARS THAT THE JOB MUST BE DONE BY ABLE DEDICATED
LJ046-0099 THOROUGHLY PROFESSIONAL PERSONNEL USING THE BEST TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT THAT CAN BE DEVISED
LJ046-0100 THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY DEMANDS AN EXAMINATION OF THE PROTECTIVE MEASURES EMPLOYED TO SAFE GUARD HIM
LJ046-0101 AND AN INQUIRY WHETHER IMPROVEMENTS CAN BE MADE WHICH WILL REDUCE THE RISK OF ANOTHER SUCH TRAGEDY
LJ046-0102 THIS SECTION CONSIDERS FIRST THE MEANS USED TO LOCATE POTENTIAL SOURCES OF DANGER TO THE PRESIDENT IN TIME TO TAKE APPROPRIATE PRECAUTIONS
LJ046-0103 IN THIS CONNECTION THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO FEDERAL AGENCIES ABOUT LEE HARVEY OSWALD
LJ046-0104 IS SET OUT AND THE REASONS WHY THIS INFORMATION WAS NOT FURNISHED TO THE SECRET SERVICE APPRAISED
LJ046-0105 SECOND THE ADEQUACY OF OTHER ADVANCE PREPARATIONS FOR THE SECURITY OF THE PRESIDENT DURING HIS VISIT TO DALLAS
LJ046-0106 LARGELY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SECRET SERVICE IS CONSIDERED
LJ046-0107 FINALLY THE PERFORMANCE OF THOSE CHARGED WITH THE IMMEDIATE RESPONSIBILITY OF PROTECTING THE PRESIDENT ON NOVEMBER 22 IS REVIEWED
LJ046-0108 INTELLIGENCE FUNCTIONS RELATING TO PRESIDENTIAL PROTECTION AT THE TIME OF THE DALLAS TRIP
LJ046-0109 A BASIC ELEMENT OF PRESIDENTIAL PROTECTION
LJ046-0110 IS THE IDENTIFICATION AND ELIMINATION OF POSSIBLE SOURCES OF DANGER TO THE PRESIDENT BEFORE THE DANGER BECOMES ACTUAL
LJ046-0111 THE SECRET SERVICE HAS ATTEMPTED TO PERFORM THIS FUNCTION THROUGH THE ACTIVITIES OF ITS PROTECTIVE RESEARCH SECTION
LJ046-0112 AND REQUESTS TO OTHER AGENCIES FEDERAL AND LOCAL FOR USEFUL INFORMATION
LJ046-0113 THE COMMISSION HAS CONCLUDED THAT AT THE TIME OF THE ASSASSINATION
LJ046-0114 THE ARRANGEMENTS RELIED UPON BY THE SECRET SERVICE TO PERFORM THIS FUNCTION WERE SERIOUSLY DEFICIENT
LJ046-0115 ADEQUACY OF PREVENTIVE INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS OF THE SECRET SERVICE
LJ046-0116 THE MAIN JOB OF THE PROTECTIVE RESEARCH SECTION PRS
LJ046-0117 IS TO COLLECT PROCESS AND EVALUATE INFORMATION ABOUT PERSONS OR GROUPS WHO MAY BE A DANGER TO THE PRESIDENT
LJ046-0118 IN ADDITION TO THIS FUNCTION PRS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SUCH TASKS
LJ046-0119 AS OBTAINING CLEARANCE OF SOME CATEGORIES OF WHITE HOUSE EMPLOYEES AND ALL TRADESMEN WHO SERVICE THE WHITE HOUSE
LJ046-0120 THE SECURITY PROCESSING OF GIFTS SENT TO THE PRESIDENT AND TECHNICAL INSPECTIONS AGAINST COVERT LISTENING DEVICES
LJ046-0121 AT THE TIME OF THE ASSASSINATION PRS WAS A VERY SMALL GROUP COMPRISED OF TWELVE SPECIALISTS AND 3 CLERKS
LJ046-0122 MANY PERSONS CALL THEMSELVES TO THE ATTENTION OF PRS BY ATTEMPTING TO VISIT THE PRESIDENT
LJ046-0123 FOR BIZARRE REASONS OR BY WRITING OR IN SOME OTHER WAY ATTEMPTING TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIM IN A THREATENING OR ABUSIVE MANNER
LJ046-0124 OR WITH UNDUE PERSISTENCE
LJ046-0125 ROBERT I. BOUCK SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE OF PRS
LJ046-0126 ESTIMATED THAT MOST OF THE MATERIAL RECEIVED BY HIS OFFICE ORIGINATED IN THIS FASHION
LJ046-0127 OR FROM THE OCCASIONAL INVESTIGATIONS INITIATED BY THE SECRET SERVICE
LJ046-0128 WHILE THE BALANCE WAS FURNISHED TO PRS BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES WITH PRIMARY SOURCE BEING THE FBI
LJ046-0129 THE TOTAL VOLUME OF INFORMATION RECEIVED BY PRS HAS RISEN STEADILY
LJ046-0130 IN NINETEEN FORTY THREE PRS RECEIVED APPROXIMATELY 9000 ITEMS OF INFORMATION
LJ046-0131 IN NINETEEN FIFTY THREE THIS HAD INCREASED TO MORE THAN 17000 ITEMS
LJ046-0132 IN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE THE TOTAL EXCEEDED 32000 ITEMS
LJ046-0133 SINCE MANY ITEMS MAY PERTAIN TO A SINGLE CASE THESE FIGURES DO NOT SHOW THE CASELOAD
LJ046-0134 IN THE PERIOD FROM NOVEMBER NINETEEN SIXTY ONE TO NOVEMBER NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ046-0135 PRS RECEIVED ITEMS IN 8709 CASES
LJ046-0136 BEFORE THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY
LJ046-0137 PRS EXPRESSED ITS INTEREST IN RECEIVING INFORMATION ON SUSPECTS IN VERY GENERAL TERMS. FOR EXAMPLE
LJ046-0138 PRS INSTRUCTED THE WHITE HOUSE MAILROOM A SOURCE OF MUCH PRS DATA
LJ046-0139 TO REFER ALL COMMUNICATIONS ON IDENTIFIED EXISTING CASES AND IN ADDITION
LJ046-0140 ANY COMMUNICATION QUOTE THAT IN ANY WAY INDICATES ANYONE MAY HAVE POSSIBLE INTENTION OF HARMING THE PRESIDENT END QUOTE
LJ046-0141 SLIGHTLY MORE SPECIFIC CRITERIA WERE ESTABLISHED FOR PRS PERSONNEL PROCESSING WHITE HOUSE MAIL REFERRED BY THE WHITE HOUSE MAILROOM
LJ046-0142 BUT AGAIN THE STANDARDS WERE VERY GENERAL
LJ046-0143 THESE INSTRUCTIONS TO PRS PERSONNEL APPEAR TO BE THE ONLY INSTANCE WHERE AN EFFORT WAS MADE TO REDUCE THE CRITERIA TO WRITING
LJ046-0144 WHEN REQUESTED TO PROVIDE A SPECIFIC STATEMENT OF THE STANDARDS EMPLOYED BY PRS IN DECIDING WHAT INFORMATION TO SEEK AND RETAIN
LJ046-0145 THE SECRET SERVICE RESPONDED QUOTE
LJ046-0146 THE CRITERIA IN EFFECT PRIOR TO NOVEMBER 22 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE FOR DETERMINING WHETHER TO ACCEPT MATERIAL FOR THE PRS GENERAL FILES
LJ046-0147 WERE BROAD AND FLEXIBLE. ALL MATERIAL IS AND WAS DESIRED ACCEPTED AND FILED IF IT INDICATED OR TENDED TO INDICATE
LJ046-0148 THAT THE SAFETY OF THE PRESIDENT IS OR MIGHT BE IN DANGER EITHER AT THE PRESENT OR IN THE FUTURE
LJ046-0149 THERE ARE MANY ACTIONS SITUATIONS AND INCIDENTS THAT MAY INDICATE SUCH POTENTIAL DANGER. SOME ARE SPECIFIC SUCH AS THREATS
LJ046-0150 DANGER MAY BE IMPLIED FROM OTHERS SUCH AS MEMBERSHIP OR ACTIVITY IN AN ORGANIZATION WHICH BELIEVES IN ASSASSINATION AS A POLITICAL WEAPON
LJ046-0151 ALL MATERIAL RECEIVED BY PRS WAS SEPARATELY SCREENED
LJ046-0152 AND A DETERMINATION MADE AS TO WHETHER THE INFORMATION MIGHT INDICATE POSSIBLE HARM TO THE PRESIDENT
LJ046-0153 IF THE MATERIAL WAS EVALUATED
LJ046-0154 AS INDICATING SOME POTENTIAL DANGER TO THE PRESIDENT  NO MATTER HOW SMALL  IT WAS INDEXED IN THE GENERAL PRS FILES
LJ046-0155 UNDER THE NAME OF THE INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS TO WHOM THAT MATERIAL RELATED END QUOTE
LJ046-0156 THE GENERAL FILES OF PRS CONSIST OF FOLDERS ON INDIVIDUALS CARD INDEXED BY NAME
LJ046-0157 THE FILES ARE MANUALLY MAINTAINED WITHOUT USE OF ANY AUTOMATIC DATAPROCESSING TECHNIQUES
LJ046-0158 AT THE TIME OF THE ASSASSINATION THE ACTIVE PRS GENERAL FILES CONTAINED APPROXIMATELY 50000 CASES
LJ046-0159 ACCUMULATED OVER A 20YEAR PERIOD SOME OF WHICH INCLUDED MORE THAN ONE INDIVIDUAL
LJ046-0160 A CASE FILE WAS ESTABLISHED IF THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE SUGGESTED THAT THE SUBJECT MIGHT BE A DANGER TO THE PRESIDENT
LJ046-0161 MANY OF THESE CASES WERE NOT INVESTIGATED BY PRS
LJ046-0162 THE CASE FILE SERVED MERELY AS A REPOSITORY FOR INFORMATION UNTIL ENOUGH HAD ACCUMULATED TO WARRANT AN INVESTIGATION
LJ046-0163 DURING THE PERIOD NOVEMBER NINETEEN SIXTY ONE TO NOVEMBER NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ046-0164 PRS INVESTIGATED 34 NEWLY ESTABLISHED OR REACTIVATED CASES CONCERNING RESIDENTS OF TEXAS
LJ046-0165 MOST OF THESE CASES INVOLVED PERSONS WHO USED THREATENING LANGUAGE IN COMMUNICATIONS TO OR ABOUT THE PRESIDENT
LJ046-0166 AN ADDITIONAL 115 CASES CONCERNING TEXAS RESIDENTS WERE ESTABLISHED BUT NOT INVESTIGATED
LJ046-0167 WHEN PRS LEARNS OF AN INDIVIDUAL WHOSE CONDUCT WARRANTS SCRUTINY IT REQUESTS AN INVESTIGATION BY THE CLOSEST SECRET SERVICE FIELD OFFICE
LJ046-0168 OF WHICH THERE ARE 65 THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY
LJ046-0169 IF THE FIELD OFFICE DETERMINES THAT THE CASE SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO CONTINUING REVIEW PRS ESTABLISHES A FILE
LJ046-0170 WHICH REQUIRES A CHECKUP AT LEAST EVERY 6 MONTHS
LJ046-0171 THIS MIGHT INVOLVE A PERSONAL INTERVIEW OR INTERVIEWS WITH MEMBERS OF THE PERSON'S HOUSEHOLD. WHEREVER POSSIBLE
LJ046-0172 THE SECRET SERVICE ARRANGES FOR THE FAMILY AND FRIENDS OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS
LJ046-0173 TO ADVISE THE FIELD OFFICE IF THE SUBJECT DISPLAYS SIGNS OF INCREASED DANGER OR PLANS TO LEAVE HIS HOME AREA
LJ046-0174 AT THE TIME OF THE ASSASSINATION THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY 400 PERSONS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY WHO WERE SUBJECT TO PERIODIC REVIEW
LJ046-0175 IF PRS CONCLUDES AFTER INVESTIGATION
LJ046-0176 THAT AN INDIVIDUAL PRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT DANGER TO THE LIFE OF THE PRESIDENT HIS NAME IS PLACED IN A TRIP INDEX FILE
LJ046-0177 WHICH IS MAINTAINED ON A GEOGRAPHICAL FIELD OFFICE BASIS
LJ046-0178 AT THE TIME OF THE ASSASSINATION THE NAMES OF ABOUT 100 PERSONS WERE IN THIS INDEX ALL OF WHOM WERE INCLUDED IN THE GROUP OF 400
LJ046-0179 BEING REVIEWED REGULARLY
LJ046-0180 PRS ALSO MAINTAINS AN ALBUM OF PHOTOGRAPHS AND DESCRIPTIONS OF ABOUT TWELVE TO FIFTEEN INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE REGARDED AS CLEAR RISKS TO THE PRESIDENT
LJ046-0181 AND WHO DO NOT HAVE A FIXED PLACE OF RESIDENCE. MEMBERS OF THE WHITE HOUSE DETAIL OF THE SECRET SERVICE HAVE COPIES OF THIS ALBUM
LJ046-0182 INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE REGARDED AS DANGEROUS TO THE PRESIDENT
LJ046-0183 AND WHO ARE IN PENAL OR HOSPITAL CUSTODY ARE LISTED ONLY IN THE GENERAL FILES OF PRS
LJ046-0184 BUT THERE IS A SYSTEM FOR THE IMMEDIATE NOTIFICATION OF THE SECRET SERVICE BY THE CONFINING INSTITUTION WHEN A SUBJECT IS RELEASED OR ESCAPES
LJ046-0185 PRS ATTEMPTS TO ELIMINATE SERIOUS RISKS BY HOSPITALIZATION OR WHERE NECESSARY
LJ046-0186 THE PROSECUTION OF PERSONS WHO HAVE COMMITTED AN OFFENSE SUCH AS THREATENING THE PRESIDENT
LJ046-0187 IN JUNE NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR PRS HAD ARRANGEMENTS TO BE NOTIFIED ABOUT THE RELEASE OR ESCAPE OF APPROXIMATELY 1000 PERSONS
LJ046-0188 IN SUMMARY AT THE TIME OF THE ASSASSINATION
LJ046-0189 PRS HAD RECEIVED OVER A 20YEAR PERIOD BASIC INFORMATION ON SOME 50000 CASES
LJ046-0190 IT HAD ARRANGEMENTS TO BE NOTIFIED ABOUT RELEASE FROM CONFINEMENT IN ROUGHLY 1000 CASES
LJ046-0191 IT HAD ESTABLISHED PERIODIC REGULAR REVIEW OF THE STATUS OF 400 INDIVIDUALS
LJ046-0192 IT REGARDED APPROXIMATELY 100 OF THESE 400 CASES AS SERIOUS RISKS
LJ046-0193 AND TWELVE TO FIFTEEN OF THESE CASES AS HIGHLY DANGEROUS RISKS
LJ046-0194 MEMBERS OF THE WHITE HOUSE DETAIL WERE EXPECTED TO FAMILIARIZE THEMSELVES WITH THE DESCRIPTIONS AND PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE HIGHEST RISK CASES
LJ046-0195 THE CASES SUBJECT TO PERIODIC REVIEW AND THE 100 OR SO CASES IN THE HIGHER RISK CATEGORY
LJ046-0196 WERE FILED ON A GEOGRAPHIC BASIS AND COULD CONVENIENTLY BE REVIEWED BY A SECRET SERVICE AGENT PREPARING FOR A PRESIDENTIAL TRIP
LJ046-0197 TO A PARTICULAR PART OF THE COUNTRY. THESE WERE THE FILES REVIEWED BY PRS ON NOVEMBER 8 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ046-0198 AT THE REQUEST OF SPECIAL AGENT LAWSON ADVANCE AGENT FOR PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S TRIP TO DALLAS
LJ046-0199 THE GENERAL FILES OF PRS WERE NOT INDEXED BY GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION AND WERE OF LITTLE USE IN PREPARING FOR A PRESIDENTIAL VISIT TO A SPECIFIC LOCALITY
LJ046-0200 SECRET SERVICE REQUESTS TO OTHER AGENCIES FOR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION
LJ046-0201 WERE NO MORE SPECIFIC THAN THE BROAD AND GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS ITS OWN AGENTS AND THE WHITE HOUSE MAILROOM
LJ046-0202 THE HEAD OF PRS TESTIFIED THAT THE SECRET SERVICE REQUESTED OTHER AGENCIES TO PROVIDE QUOTE
LJ046-0203 ANY AND ALL INFORMATION THAT THEY MAY COME IN CONTACT WITH THAT WOULD INDICATE DANGER TO THE PRESIDENT END QUOTE
LJ046-0204 THESE REQUESTS WERE COMMUNICATED IN WRITING BY THE SECRET SERVICE RATHER THE SERVICE DEPENDED ON THE PERSONAL LIAISON MAINTAINED BY PRS
LJ046-0205 WITH THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE FEDERAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES PARTICULARLY THE FBI
LJ046-0206 AND AT THE WORKING LEVEL WITH PERSONNEL OF THE FIELD OFFICES OF THE VARIOUS AGENCIES. THE SERVICE FREQUENTLY PARTICIPATED
LJ046-0207 IN THE TRAINING PROGRAMS OF OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND AGENTS FROM OTHER AGENCIES ATTENDED THE REGULAR SECRET SERVICE TRAINING SCHOOLS
LJ046-0208 PRESIDENTIAL PROTECTION WAS AN IMPORTANT TOPIC IN THESE TRAINING PROGRAMS
LJ046-0209 IN THE ABSENCE OF MORE SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES INTERPRETED THE SECRET SERVICE'S INFORMAL REQUESTS
LJ046-0210 TO RELATE PRINCIPALLY TO OVERT THREATS TO HARM THE PRESIDENT OR OTHER SPECIFIC MANIFESTATIONS OF HOSTILITY
LJ046-0211 FOR EXAMPLE AT THE TIME OF THE ASSASSINATION THE FBI HANDBOOK WHICH IS IN THE POSSESSION OF EVERY BUREAU SPECIAL AGENT PROVIDED QUOTE
LJ046-0212 THREATS AGAINST THE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S
LJ046-0213 MEMBERS OF HIS IMMEDIATE FAMILY THE PRESIDENTELECT AND THE VICEPRESIDENT. INVESTIGATION OF THREATS AGAINST THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
LJ046-0214 MEMBERS OF HIS IMMEDIATE FAMILY THE PRESIDENTELECT AND THE VICEPRESIDENT IS WITHIN THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE U.S. SECRET SERVICE
LJ046-0215 ANY INFORMATION INDICATING THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ATTEMPT AGAINST THE PERSON OR SAFETY OF THE PRESIDENT
LJ046-0216 MEMBERS OF THE IMMEDIATE FAMILY OF THE PRESIDENT THE PRESIDENTELECT OR THE VICEPRESIDENT
LJ046-0217 MUST BE REFERRED IMMEDIATELY BY THE MOST EXPEDITIOUS MEANS OF COMMUNICATION TO THE NEAREST OFFICE OF THE U.S. SECRET SERVICE
LJ046-0218 ADVISE THE BUREAU AT THE SAME TIME BY TELETYPE OF THE INFORMATION SO FURNISHED TO THE SECRET SERVICE AND THE FACT THAT IT HAS BEEN SO DISSEMINATED
LJ046-0219 THE ABOVE ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN WITHOUT DELAY IN ORDER TO ATTEMPT TO VERIFY THE INFORMATION AND NO EVALUATION OF THE INFORMATION SHOULD BE ATTEMPTED
LJ046-0220 WHEN THE THREAT IS IN THE FORM OF A WRITTEN COMMUNICATION GIVE A COPY TO LOCAL SECRET SERVICE AND FORWARD THE ORIGINAL TO THE BUREAU
LJ046-0221 WHERE IT WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO SECRET SERVICE HEADQUARTERS IN WASHINGTON
LJ046-0222 THE REFERRAL OF THE COPY TO LOCAL SECRET SERVICE SHOULD NOT DELAY THE IMMEDIATE REFERRAL OF THE INFORMATION BY THE FASTEST AVAILABLE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION
LJ046-0223 TO SECRET SERVICE LOCALLY END QUOTE
LJ046-0224 THE STATE DEPARTMENT ADVISED THE SECRET SERVICE OF ALL CRANK AND THREAT LETTER MAIL
LJ046-0225 OR CRANK VISITORS AND FURNISHED REPORTS CONCERNING ANY ASSASSINATION OR ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION OF A RULER OR OTHER MAJOR OFFICIAL ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD
LJ046-0226 THE SEVERAL MILITARY INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES REPORTED CRANK MAIL AND SIMILAR THREATS INVOLVING THE PRESIDENT
LJ046-0227 ACCORDING TO SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE BOUCK
LJ046-0228 THE SECRET SERVICE HAD NO STANDARD PROCEDURE FOR THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF ITS REQUESTS FOR AND RECEIPT OF INFORMATION FROM OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES
LJ046-0229 THE COMMISSION BELIEVES THAT THE FACILITIES AND PROCEDURES OF THE PROTECTIVE RESEARCH SECTION OF THE SECRET SERVICE
LJ046-0230 PRIOR TO NOVEMBER 22 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE WERE INADEQUATE
LJ046-0231 ITS EFFORTS APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN TOO LARGELY DIRECTED AT THE CRANK THREAT
LJ046-0232 ALTHOUGH THE SERVICE RECOGNIZED THAT ITS ADVANCE PREVENTIVE MEASURES MUST ENCOMPASS MORE THAN THESE MOST OBVIOUS DANGERS
LJ046-0233 IT MADE LITTLE EFFORT TO IDENTIFY FACTORS IN THE ACTIVITIES OF AN INDIVIDUAL
LJ046-0234 OR AN ORGANIZED GROUP OTHER THAN SPECIFIC THREATS WHICH SUGGESTED A SOURCE OF DANGER AGAINST WHICH TIMELY PRECAUTIONS COULD BE TAKEN
LJ046-0235 EXCEPT FOR ITS SPECIAL TRIP INDEX FILE OF 400 NAMES
LJ046-0236 NONE OF THE CASES IN THE PRS GENERAL FILES WAS AVAILABLE FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEW ON A GEOGRAPHIC BASIS WHEN THE PRESIDENT PLANNED A PARTICULAR TRIP
LJ046-0237 AS REPORTED IN CHAPTER 2 WHEN THE SPECIAL FILE WAS REVIEWED ON NOVEMBER 8
LJ046-0238 IT CONTAINED THE NAMES OF NO PERSONS FROM THE ENTIRE DALLASFORT WORTH AREA
LJ046-0239 NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT AMBASSADOR STEVENSON HAD BEEN ABUSED BY PICKETS IN DALLAS LESS THAN A MONTH BEFORE
LJ046-0240 BOUCK EXPLAINED THE FAILURE TO TRY TO IDENTIFY THE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN THE STEVENSON INCIDENT AFTER IT OCCURRED ON THE GROUND THAT
LJ046-0241 PRS REQUIRED A MORE DIRECT INDICATION OF A THREAT TO THE PRESIDENT AND THAT THERE WAS NO SUCH INDICATION UNTIL THE PRESIDENT'S SCHEDULED VISIT TO THAT AREA BECAME KNOWN
LJ046-0242 SUCH AN APPROACH SERIOUSLY UNDERMINES THE PRECAUTIONARY NATURE OF PRS WORK
LJ046-0243 IF THE PRESENCE IN DALLAS OF THE STEVENSON PICKETS MIGHT HAVE CREATED A DANGER FOR THE PRESIDENT ON A VISIT TO THAT CITY
LJ046-0244 PRS SHOULD HAVE INVESTIGATED AND BEEN PREPARED TO GUARD AGAINST IT
LJ046-0245 OTHER AGENCIES OCCASIONALLY PROVIDED INFORMATION TO THE SECRET SERVICE CONCERNING POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS POLITICAL GROUPS
LJ046-0246 THIS WAS DONE IN THE CASE OF THE NATIONALIST PARTY OF PUERTO RICO FOR EXAMPLE BUT ONLY AFTER MEMBERS OF THE GROUP HAD RESORTED TO POLITICAL VIOLENCE
LJ046-0247 HOWEVER THE VAGUE REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION WHICH THE SECRET SERVICE MADE
LJ046-0248 TO FEDERAL INTELLIGENCE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WERE NOT WELL DESIGNED TO ELICIT INFORMATION FROM THEM
LJ046-0249 ABOUT PERSONS OTHER THAN THOSE WHO WERE OBVIOUS THREATS TO THE PRESIDENT
LJ046-0250 THE REQUESTS SHIFTED THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR EVALUATING DIFFICULT CASES FROM THE SERVICE THE AGENCY MOST RESPONSIBLE FOR PERFORMING THAT TASK
LJ046-0251 TO THE OTHER AGENCIES NO SPECIFIC GUIDANCE WAS PROVIDED
LJ046-0252 ALTHOUGH THE CIA HAD ON FILE REQUESTS FROM THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT FOR INFORMATION ON THE COUNTERFEITING OF U.S. CURRENCY AND CERTAIN SMUGGLING MATTERS
LJ046-0253 IT HAD NO WRITTEN SPECIFICATION OF INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION COLLECTED BY CIA ABROAD WHICH WAS DESIRED BY THE SECRET SERVICE
LJ046-0254 IN ADVANCE OF PRESIDENTIAL TRIPS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES
LJ047-0001 REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION ON THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY. THE WARREN COMMISSION REPORT BY THE PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION ON THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY
LJ047-0002 CHAPTER EIGHT THE PROTECTION OF THE PRESIDENT PART TWO
LJ047-0003 INFORMATION KNOWN ABOUT LEE HARVEY OSWALD PRIOR TO THE ASSASSINATION
LJ047-0004 NO INFORMATION CONCERNING LEE HARVEY OSWALD APPEARED IN PRS FILES BEFORE THE PRESIDENT'S TRIP TO DALLAS
LJ047-0005 OSWALD WAS KNOWN TO OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES WITH WHICH THE SECRET SERVICE MAINTAINED INTELLIGENCE LIAISON
LJ047-0006 THE FBI HAD BEEN INTERESTED IN HIM TO SOME DEGREE AT LEAST SINCE THE TIME OF HIS DEFECTION IN OCTOBER NINETEEN FIFTY NINE
LJ047-0007 IT HAD INTERVIEWED HIM TWICE SHORTLY AFTER HIS RETURN TO THE UNITED STATES AGAIN A YEAR LATER AT HIS REQUEST
LJ047-0008 AND WAS INVESTIGATING HIM AT THE TIME OF THE ASSASSINATION. THE COMMISSION HAS TAKEN THE TESTIMONY OF BUREAU AGENTS
LJ047-0009 WHO INTERVIEWED OSWALD AFTER HIS RETURN FROM THE SOVIET UNION AND PRIOR TO NOVEMBER 22 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ047-0010 THE AGENT WHO WAS ASSIGNED HIS CASE AT THE TIME OF THE ASSASSINATION THE DIRECTOR OF THE FBI
LJ047-0011 AND THE ASSISTANT TO THE DIRECTOR IN CHARGE OF ALL INVESTIGATIVE ACTIVITIES UNDER THE DIRECTOR AND ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR. IN ADDITION
LJ047-0012 THE DIRECTOR AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR PLANS OF THE CIA TESTIFIED CONCERNING THAT AGENCY'S LIMITED KNOWLEDGE OF OSWALD BEFORE THE ASSASSINATION
LJ047-0013 FINALLY THE COMMISSION HAS REVIEWED THE COMPLETE FILES ON OSWALD AS THEY EXISTED AT THE TIME OF THE ASSASSINATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE
LJ047-0014 THE OFFICE OF NAVAL INTELLIGENCE THE FBI AND THE CIA. THE INFORMATION KNOWN TO THE FBI IS SUMMARIZED BELOW
LJ047-0015 FROM DEFECTION TO RETURN TO FORT WORTH
LJ047-0016 THE FBI OPENED A FILE ON OSWALD IN OCTOBER NINETEEN FIFTY NINE WHEN NEWS REPORTS APPEARED OF HIS DEFECTION TO THE SOVIET UNION
LJ047-0017 THE FILE WAS OPENED QUOTE
LJ047-0018 FOR THE PURPOSE OF CORRELATING INFORMATION INASMUCH AS HE WAS CONSIDERED A POSSIBLE SECURITY RISK IN THE EVENT HE RETURNED TO THIS COUNTRY END QUOTE
LJ047-0019 OSWALD'S DEFECTION WAS ALSO THE OCCASION FOR THE OPENING OF FILES BY THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE CIA AND THE OFFICE OF NAVAL INTELLIGENCE
LJ047-0020 UNTIL APRIL NINETEEN SIXTY FBI ACTIVITY CONSISTED OF PLACING IN OSWALD'S FILE
LJ047-0021 INFORMATION REGARDING HIS RELATIONS WITH THE U.S. EMBASSY IN MOSCOW AND BACKGROUND DATA RELATING LARGELY TO HIS PRIOR MILITARY SERVICE
LJ047-0022 PROVIDED BY OTHER AGENCIES
LJ047-0023 IN APRIL NINETEEN SIXTY MRS. MARGUERITE OSWALD AND ROBERT OSWALD WERE INTERVIEWED
LJ047-0024 IN THE COURSE OF A ROUTINE FBI INVESTIGATION OF TRANSFERS OF SMALL SUMS OF MONEY FROM MRS. OSWALD TO HER SON IN RUSSIA
LJ047-0025 DURING THE NEXT 2 YEARS THE FBI CONTINUED TO ACCUMULATE INFORMATION
LJ047-0026 AND KEPT ITSELF INFORMED ON OSWALD'S STATUS BY PERIODIC REVIEWS OF STATE DEPARTMENT AND OFFICE OF NAVAL INTELLIGENCE FILES
LJ047-0027 IN THIS WAY IT LEARNED THAT WHEN OSWALD HAD ARRIVED IN THE SOVIET UNION
LJ047-0028 HE HAD ATTEMPTED TO RENOUNCE HIS U.S. CITIZENSHIP AND APPLIED FOR SOVIET CITIZENSHIP
LJ047-0029 HAD DESCRIBED HIMSELF AS A MARXIST HAD SAID HE WOULD GIVE THE SOVIET UNION ANY USEFUL INFORMATION HE HAD ACQUIRED
LJ047-0030 AS A MARINE RADAR TECHNICIAN AND HAD DISPLAYED AN ARROGANT AND AGGRESSIVE ATTITUDE AT THE U.S. EMBASSY
LJ047-0031 IT LEARNED ALSO THAT OSWALD HAD BEEN DISCHARGED FROM THE MARINE CORPS RESERVE AS UNDESIRABLE IN AUGUST NINETEEN SIXTY
LJ047-0032 IN JUNE NINETEEN SIXTY TWO THE BUREAU WAS ADVISED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF OSWALD'S PLAN TO RETURN TO THE UNITED STATES
LJ047-0033 THE BUREAU MADE ARRANGEMENTS TO BE ADVISED BY IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES OF HIS RETURN
LJ047-0034 AND INSTRUCTED THE DALLAS OFFICE TO INTERVIEW HIM WHEN HE GOT BACK TO DETERMINE WHETHER HE HAD BEEN RECRUITED BY A SOVIET INTELLIGENCE SERVICE
LJ047-0035 OSWALD'S FILE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE PASSPORT OFFICE WAS REVIEWED IN JUNE NINETEEN SIXTY TWO
LJ047-0036 IT REVEALED HIS LETTER OF JANUARY 30 NINETEEN SIXTY TWO TO SECRETARY OF THE NAVY CONNALLY
LJ047-0037 IN WHICH HE PROTESTED HIS DISCHARGE AND DECLARED THAT HE WOULD USE QUOTE ALL MEANS END QUOTE TO CORRECT IT
LJ047-0038 THE FILE REFLECTED THE DEPARTMENT'S DETERMINATION THAT OSWALD HAD NOT EXPATRIATED HIMSELF
LJ047-0039 FROM RETURN TO FORT WORTH TO MOVE TO NEW ORLEANS
LJ047-0040 OSWALD WAS FIRST INTERVIEWED BY FBI AGENTS JOHN W. FAIN AND B. TOM CARTER ON JUNE 26 NINETEEN SIXTY TWO
LJ047-0041 AGENT FAIN REPORTED TO HEADQUARTERS THAT OSWALD WAS IMPATIENT AND ARROGANT
LJ047-0042 AND UNWILLING TO ANSWER QUESTIONS REGARDING HIS MOTIVE FOR GOING TO THE SOVIET UNION
LJ047-0043 OSWALD QUOTE DENIED THAT HE HAD EVER DENOUNCED HIS U.S. CITIZENSHIP AND THAT HE HAD EVER APPLIED FOR SOVIET CITIZENSHIP SPECIFICALLY END QUOTE
LJ047-0044 OSWALD WAS HOWEVER WILLING TO DISCUSS HIS CONTACTS WITH SOVIET AUTHORITIES. HE DENIED HAVING ANY INVOLVEMENT WITH SOVIET INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES
LJ047-0045 AND PROMISED TO ADVISE THE FBI IF HE HEARD FROM THEM
LJ047-0046 AGENT FAIN WAS NOT SATISFIED BY THIS INTERVIEW AND ARRANGED TO SEE OSWALD AGAIN ON AUGUST SIXTEEN NINETEEN SIXTY TWO
LJ047-0047 ACCORDING TO FAIN'S CONTEMPORANEOUS MEMORANDUM AND HIS PRESENT RECOLLECTION
LJ047-0048 WHILE OSWALD REMAINED SOMEWHAT EVASIVE AT THIS INTERVIEW HE WAS NOT ANTAGONISTIC AND SEEMED GENERALLY TO BE SETTLING DOWN
LJ047-0049 MARINA OSWALD HOWEVER RECALLED THAT HER HUSBAND WAS UPSET BY THIS INTERVIEW
LJ047-0050 OSWALD AGAIN AGREED TO ADVISE THE FBI IF HE WERE APPROACHED UNDER SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES HOWEVER HE DEPRECATED THE POSSIBILITY OF THIS HAPPENING
LJ047-0051 PARTICULARLY SINCE HIS EMPLOYMENT DID NOT INVOLVE ANY SENSITIVE INFORMATION
LJ047-0052 HAVING CONCLUDED THAT OSWALD WAS NOT A SECURITY RISK OR POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS OR VIOLENT
LJ047-0053 FAIN DETERMINED THAT NOTHING FURTHER REMAINED TO BE DONE AT THAT TIME AND RECOMMENDED THAT THE CASE BE PLACED IN A CLOSED STATUS
LJ047-0054 THIS IS AN ADMINISTRATIVE CLASSIFICATION INDICATING THAT NO FURTHER WORK HAS BEEN SCHEDULED
LJ047-0055 IT DOES NOT PRECLUDE THE AGENT IN CHARGE OF THE CASE FROM REOPENING IT IF HE FEELS THAT FURTHER WORK SHOULD BE DONE
LJ047-0056 FROM AUGUST NINETY SIXTY TWO
LJ047-0057 UNTIL MARCH NINETEEN SIXTY THREE THE FBI CONTINUED TO ACCUMULATE INFORMATION REGARDING OSWALD BUT ENGAGED IN NO ACTIVE INVESTIGATION
LJ047-0058 AGENT FAIN RETIRED FROM THE FBI IN OCTOBER NENETEEN SIXTY TWO AND THE CLOSED OSWALD CASE WAS NOT REASSIGNED
LJ047-0059 HOWEVER PURSUANT TO A REGULAR BUREAU PRACTICE OF INTERVIEWING CERTAIN IMMIGRANTS FROM IRON CURTAIN COUNTRIES
LJ047-0060 FAIN HAD BEEN ASSIGNED TO SEE MARINA OSWALD AT AN APPROPRIATE TIME
LJ047-0061 THIS ASSIGNMENT WAS GIVEN TO AGENT JAMES P. HOSTY JR. OF THE DALLAS OFFICE UPON FAIN'S RETIREMENT
LJ047-0062 IN MARCH NINETEEN SIXTY THREE WHILE ATTEMPTING TO LOCATE MARINA OSWALD
LJ047-0063 AGENT HOSTY WAS TOLD BY MRS. M. F. TOBIAS A FORMER LANDLADY OF THE OSWALDS AT 602 ELSBETH STREET IN DALLAS
LJ047-0064 THAT OTHER TENANTS HAD COMPLAINED BECAUSE OSWALD WAS DRINKING TO EXCESS AND BEATING HIS WIFE
LJ047-0065 THIS INFORMATION LED HOSTY TO REVIEW OSWALD'S FILE FROM WHICH HE LEARNED THAT OSWALD HAD BECOME A SUBSCRIBER TO THE WORKER
LJ047-0066 A COMMUNIST PARTY PUBLICATION
LJ047-0067 HOSTY DECIDED THAT THE LEE HARVEY OSWALD CASE SHOULD BE REOPENED BECAUSE OF THE ALLEGED PERSONAL DIFFICULTIES AND THE CONTACT WITH THE WORKER
LJ047-0068 AND HIS RECOMMENDATION WAS ACCEPTED HE DECIDED HOWEVER NOT TO INTERVIEW MARINA OSWALD AT THAT TIME AND MERELY DETERMINED
LJ047-0069 THAT THE OSWALDS WERE LIVING AT 214 NEELY STREET IN DALLAS
LJ047-0070 ON APRIL TWENTY ONE NINETEEN SIXTY THREE THE FBI FIELD OFFICE IN NEW YORK
LJ047-0071 WAS ADVISED THAT OSWALD WAS IN CONTACT WITH THE FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE IN NEW YORK AND THAT HE HAD WRITTEN TO THE COMMITTEE
LJ047-0072 STATING THAT HE HAD DISTRIBUTED ITS PAMPHLETS ON THE STREETS OF DALLAS. THIS INFORMATION DID NOT REACH AGENT HOSTY IN DALLAS UNTIL JUNE
LJ047-0073 HOSTY CONSIDERED THE INFORMATION TO BE QUOTE STALE UNQUOTE BY THAT TIME AND DID NOT ATTEMPT TO VERIFY OSWALD'S REPORTED STATEMENT
LJ047-0074 UNDER A GENERAL BUREAU REQUEST TO BE ON THE ALERT FOR ACTIVITIES OF THE FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE
LJ047-0075 HOSTY HAD INQUIRED EARLIER AND FOUND NO EVIDENCE THAT IT WAS FUNCTIONING IN THE DALLAS AREA
LJ047-0076 IN NEW ORLEANS IN THE MIDDLE OF MAY OF NINETEEN SIXTY THREE AGENT HOSTY CHECKED OSWALD'S LAST KNOWN RESIDENCE AND FOUND THAT HE HAD MOVED
LJ047-0077 OSWALD WAS TENTATIVELY LOCATED IN NEW ORLEANS IN JUNE
LJ047-0078 AND HOSTY ASKED THE NEW ORLEANS FBI OFFICE TO DETERMINE OSWALD'S ADDRESS AND WHAT HE WAS DOING
LJ047-0079 THE NEW ORLEANS OFFICE INVESTIGATED AND LOCATED OSWALD LEARNING HIS ADDRESS AND FORMER PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT ON AUGUST 5 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ047-0080 A CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANT ADVISED THE FBI THAT OSWALD WAS NOT KNOWN TO BE ENGAGED IN COMMUNIST PARTY ACTIVITIES IN NEW ORLEANS
LJ047-0081 ON JUNE 24 OSWALD APPLIED IN NEW ORLEANS FOR A PASSPORT STATING THAT HE PLANNED TO DEPART BY SHIP
LJ047-0082 FOR AN EXTENDED TOUR OF WESTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES THE SOVIET UNION FINLAND AND POLAND
LJ047-0083 THE PASSPORT OFFICE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE IN WASHINGTON HAD NO LISTING FOR OSWALD REQUIRING SPECIAL TREATMENT
LJ047-0084 AND HIS APPLICATION WAS APPROVED ON THE FOLLOWING DAY
LJ047-0085 THE FBI HAD NOT ASKED TO BE INFORMED OF ANY EFFORT BY OSWALD TO OBTAIN A PASSPORT
LJ047-0086 AS IT MIGHT HAVE UNDER EXISTING PROCEDURES AND DID NOT KNOW OF HIS APPLICATION
LJ047-0087 ACCORDING TO THE BUREAU QUOTE
LJ047-0088 WE DID NOT REQUEST THE STATE DEPARTMENT TO INCLUDE OSWALD ON A LIST WHICH WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN ADVISING US OF ANY APPLICATION FOR A PASSPORT
LJ047-0089 INASMUCH AS THE FACTS RELATING TO OSWALD'S ACTIVITIES AT THAT TIME DID NOT WARRANT SUCH ACTION
LJ047-0090 OUR INVESTIGATION OF OSWALD HAD DISCLOSED NO EVIDENCE THAT OSWALD WAS ACTING UNDER THE INSTRUCTIONS OR ON BEHALF OF

LJ047-0092 ON AUGUST 9 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ047-0093 OSWALD WAS ARRESTED AND JAILED BY THE NEW ORLEANS POLICE DEPARTMENT FOR DISTURBING THE PEACE IN CONNECTION WITH A STREET FIGHT WHICH BROKE OUT WHEN HE WAS ACCOSTED
LJ047-0094 BY ANTICASTRO CUBANS WHILE DISTRIBUTING LEAFLETS ON BEHALF OF THE FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE
LJ047-0095 ON THE NEXT DAY HE ASKED THE NEW ORLEANS POLICE TO ARRANGE FOR HIM TO BE INTERVIEWED BY THE FBI
LJ047-0096 THE POLICE CALLED THE LOCAL FBI OFFICE AND AN AGENT JOHN L. QUIGLEY WAS SENT TO THE POLICE STATION
LJ047-0097 AGENT QUIGLEY DID NOT KNOW OF OSWALD'S PRIOR FBI RECORD WHEN HE INTERVIEWED HIM
LJ047-0098 INASMUCH AS THE POLICE HAD NOT GIVEN OSWALD'S NAME TO THE BUREAU WHEN THEY CALLED THE OFFICE
LJ047-0099 QUIGLEY RECALLED THAT OSWALD WAS RECEPTIVE WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT HIS GENERAL BACKGROUND
LJ047-0100 BUT LESS THAN COMPLETELY TRUTHFUL OR COOPERATIVE WHEN INTERROGATED ABOUT THE FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE
LJ047-0101 QUIGLEY TESTIFIED QUOTE
LJ047-0102 WHEN I BEGAN ASKING HIM SPECIFIC DETAILS WITH RESPECT TO HIS ACTIVITIES IN THE FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE IN NEW ORLEANS AS TO WHERE MEETINGS WERE HELD
LJ047-0103 WHO WAS INVOLVED WHAT OCCURRED HE WAS RETICENT TO FURNISH INFORMATION
LJ047-0104 RELUCTANT AND ACTUALLY AS FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED WAS COMPLETELY EVASIVE ON THEM END QUOTE
LJ047-0105 IN QUIGLEY'S JUDGMENT
LJ047-0106 OSWALD QUOTE WAS PROBABLY MAKING A SELFSERVING STATEMENT IN ATTEMPTING TO EXPLAIN TO ME WHY HE WAS DISTRIBUTING THIS LITERATURE AND FOR NO OTHER REASON
LJ047-0107 AND WHEN I GOT TO QUESTIONING HIM FURTHER THEN HE FELT THAT HIS PURPOSE HAD BEEN SERVED AND HE WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING FURTHER END QUOTE
LJ047-0108 DURING THE INTERVIEW QUIGLEY OBTAINED BACKGROUND INFORMATION FROM OSWALD WHICH WAS INCONSISTENT WITH INFORMATION ALREADY IN THE BUREAU'S POSSESSION
LJ047-0109 WHEN QUIGLEY RETURNED TO HIS OFFICE HE LEARNED
LJ047-0110 THAT ANOTHER BUREAU AGENT MILTON R. KNACK HAD BEEN CONDUCTING A BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION OF OSWALD AT THE REQUEST OF AGENT HOSTY IN DALLAS
LJ047-0111 QUIGLEY ADVISED KNACK OF HIS INTERVIEW AND GAVE HIM A DETAILED MEMORANDUM
LJ047-0112 KNACK WAS AWARE OF THE FACTS KNOWN TO THE FBI AND RECOGNIZED OSWALD'S FALSE STATEMENTS
LJ047-0113 FOR EXAMPLE OSWALD CLAIMED THAT HIS WIFE'S MAIDEN NAME WAS PROSSA
LJ047-0114 AND THAT THEY HAD BEEN MARRIED IN FORT WORTH AND LIVED THERE UNTIL COMING TO NEW ORLEANS. HE HAD TOLD THE NEW ORLEANS ARRESTING OFFICERS THAT HE HAD BEEN BORN IN CUBA
LJ047-0115 SEVERAL DAYS LATER THE BUREAU RECEIVED ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE THAT OSWALD HAD LIED TO AGENT QUIGLEY
LJ047-0116 ON AUGUST 22 IT LEARNED THAT OSWALD HAD APPEARED ON A RADIO DISCUSSION PROGRAM ON AUGUST TWENTY ONE
LJ047-0117 WILLIAM STUCKEY WHO HAD APPEARED ON THE RADIO PROGRAM WITH OSWALD TOLD THE BUREAU ON AUGUST THIRTY
LJ047-0118 THAT OSWALD HAD TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD WORKED AND BEEN MARRIED IN THE SOVIET UNION
LJ047-0119 NEITHER THESE DISCREPANCIES NOR THE FACT THAT OSWALD HAD INITIATED THE FBI INTERVIEW
LJ047-0120 WAS CONSIDERED SUFFICIENTLY UNUSUAL TO NECESSITATE ANOTHER INTERVIEW ALAN H. BELMONT ASSISTANT TO THE DIRECTOR OF THE FBI
LJ047-0121 STATED THE BUREAU'S REASONING IN THIS WAY QUOTE
LJ047-0122 OUR INTEREST IN THIS MAN AT THIS POINT WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER HIS ACTIVITIES CONSTITUTED A THREAT TO THE INTERNAL SECURITY OF THE COUNTRY
LJ047-0123 IT WAS APPARENT THAT HE HAD MADE A SELFSERVING STATEMENT TO AGENT QUIGLEY. IT BECAME A MATTER OF RECORD IN OUR FILES AS A PART OF THE CASE
LJ047-0124 AND IF WE DETERMINED THAT THE COURSE OF THE INVESTIGATION REQUIRED US TO CLARIFY OR FACE HIM DOWN WITH THIS INFORMATION WE WOULD DO IT AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME
LJ047-0125 IN OTHER WORDS HE COMMITTED NO VIOLATION OF THE LAW BY TELLING US SOMETHING THAT WASN'T TRUE AND UNLESS THIS REQUIRED FURTHER INVESTIGATION AT THAT TIME
LJ047-0126 WE WOULD HANDLE IT IN DUE COURSE IN ACCORD WITH THE WHOLE CONTEXT OF THE INVESTIGATION. END QUOTE
LJ047-0127 ON AUGUST 21 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE BUREAU HEADQUARTERS INSTRUCTED THE NEW ORLEANS AND DALLAS FIELD OFFICES
LJ047-0128 TO CONDUCT AN ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION OF OSWALD IN VIEW OF THE ACTIVITIES WHICH HAD LED TO HIS ARREST
LJ047-0129 FBI INFORMANTS IN THE NEW ORLEANS AREA FAMILIAR WITH PROCASTRO OR COMMUNIST PARTY ACTIVITY THERE
LJ047-0130 ADVISED THE BUREAU THAT OSWALD WAS UNKNOWN IN SUCH CIRCLES
LJ047-0131 IN EARLY SEPTEMBER NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ047-0132 THE FBI TRANSFERRED THE PRINCIPAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE OSWALD CASE FROM THE DALLAS OFFICE TO THE NEW ORLEANS OFFICE
LJ047-0133 SOON AFTER ON OCTOBER 1 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ047-0134 THE FBI WAS ADVISED BY THE RENTAL AGENT FOR THE OSWALDS' APARTMENT IN NEW ORLEANS THAT THEY HAD MOVED AGAIN
LJ047-0135 ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION RECEIVED BY THE BUREAU
LJ047-0136 THEY HAD VACATED THEIR APARTMENT AND MARINA OSWALD HAD DEPARTED WITH THEIR CHILD IN A STATION WAGON WITH TEXAS REGISTRATION
LJ047-0137 ON OCTOBER 3 HOSTY REOPENED THE CASE IN DALLAS TO ASSIST THE NEW ORLEANS OFFICE
LJ047-0138 HE CHECKED IN OSWALD'S OLD NEIGHBORHOOD AND THROUGHOUT THE DALLASFORT WORTH AREA BUT WAS UNABLE TO LOCATE OSWALD
LJ047-0139 THE NEXT WORD ABOUT OSWALD'S LOCATION WAS A COMMUNICATION FROM THE CIA TO THE FBI ON OCTOBER 10
LJ047-0140 ADVISING THAT AN INDIVIDUAL TENTATIVELY IDENTIFIED AS OSWALD HAD BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE SOVIET EMBASSY IN MEXICO CITY
LJ047-0141 IN EARLY OCTOBER OF NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ047-0142 THE BUREAU HAD NO EARLIER INFORMATION SUGGESTING THAT OSWALD HAD LEFT THE UNITED STATES
LJ047-0143 THE POSSIBLE CONTACT WITH THE SOVIET EMBASSY IN MEXICO INTENSIFIED THE FBI'S INTEREST IN LEARNING OSWALD'S WHEREABOUTS
LJ047-0144 THE FBI REPRESENTATIVE IN MEXICO CITY ARRANGED TO FOLLOW UP THIS INFORMATION WITH THE CIA AND TO VERIFY OSWALD'S ENTRY INTO MEXICO
LJ047-0145 THE CIA MESSAGE WAS SENT ALSO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE WHERE IT WAS REVIEWED BY PERSONNEL OF THE PASSPORT OFFICE WHO KNEW FROM OSWALD'S FILE
LJ047-0146 THAT HE HAD SOUGHT AND OBTAINED A PASSPORT ON JUNE 25 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ047-0147 THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE DID NOT ADVISE EITHER THE CIA OR THE FBI OF THESE FACTS
LJ047-0148 ON OCTOBER 25
LJ047-0149 THE NEW ORLEANS OFFICE OF THE FBI LEARNED THAT IN SEPTEMBER OSWALD HAD GIVEN A FORWARDING ADDRESS OF 2515
LJ047-0150 WEST FIFTH STREET IRVING TEXAS AFTER RECEIVING THIS INFORMATION ON OCTOBER TWENTY NINE AGENT HOSTY ATTEMPTED TO LOCATE OSWALD
LJ047-0151 ON THE SAME DAY HOSTY INTERVIEWED NEIGHBORS ON FIFTH STREET AND LEARNED THAT THE ADDRESS WAS THAT OF MRS. RUTH PAINE
LJ047-0152 HE CONDUCTED A LIMITED BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION OF THE PAINES INTENDING TO INTERVIEW MRS. PAINE AND ASK HER PARTICULARLY ABOUT OSWALD'S WHEREABOUTS
LJ047-0153 HAVING DETERMINED THAT MRS. PAINE WAS A RESPONSIBLE AND RELIABLE CITIZEN HOSTY INTERVIEWED HER ON NOVEMBER ONE
LJ047-0154 THE INTERVIEW LASTED ABOUT 20 TO 25 MINUTES. IN RESPONSE TO HOSTY'S INQUIRIES MRS. PAINE QUOTE
LJ047-0155 READILY ADMITTED THAT MRS. MARINA OSWALD AND LEE OSWALD'S TWO CHILDREN WERE STAYING WITH HER
LJ047-0156 SHE SAID THAT LEE OSWALD WAS LIVING SOMEWHERE IN DALLAS SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE SHE SAID IT WAS IN THE OAK CLIFF AREA BUT SHE DIDN'T HAVE HIS ADDRESS
LJ047-0157 I ASKED HER IF SHE KNEW WHERE HE WORKED
LJ047-0158 AFTER A MOMENT'S HESITATION SHE TOLD ME THAT HE WORKED AT THE TEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY NEAR THE DOWNTOWN AREA OF DALLAS
LJ047-0159 SHE DIDN'T HAVE THE EXACT ADDRESS AND IT IS MY RECOLLECTION THAT WE WENT TO THE PHONE BOOK AND LOOKED IT UP
LJ047-0160 FOUND IT TO BE 411 ELM STREET END QUOTE
LJ047-0161 MRS. PAINE TOLD HOSTY ALSO
LJ047-0162 THAT OSWALD WAS LIVING ALONE IN DALLAS BECAUSE SHE DID NOT WANT HIM STAYING AT HER HOUSE ALTHOUGH SHE WAS WILLING TO LET OSWALD VISIT HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN
LJ047-0163 ACCORDING TO HOSTY MRS. PAINE INDICATED THAT SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD FIND OUT WHERE OSWALD WAS LIVING AND WOULD LET HIM KNOW
LJ047-0164 AT THIS POINT IN THE INTERVIEW HOSTY GAVE MRS. PAINE HIS NAME AND OFFICE TELEPHONE NUMBER ON A PIECE OF PAPER
LJ047-0165 AT THE END OF THE INTERVIEW MARINA OSWALD CAME INTO THE ROOM WHEN HE OBSERVED THAT SHE SEEMED QUOTE QUITE ALARMED END QUOTE ABOUT THE VISIT
LJ047-0166 HOSTY ASSURED HER THROUGH MRS. PAINE AS INTERPRETER THAT THE FBI WOULD NOT HARM OR HARASS HER
LJ047-0167 ON NOVEMBER 4 HOSTY TELEPHONED THE TEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY AND LEARNED THAT OSWALD WAS WORKING THERE
LJ047-0168 AND THAT HE HAD GIVEN AS HIS ADDRESS MRS. PAINE'S RESIDENCE IN IRVING
LJ047-0169 HOSTY TOOK THE NECESSARY STEPS TO HAVE THE DALLAS OFFICE OF THE FBI RATHER THAN THE NEW ORLEANS OFFICE REESTABLISHED AS THE OFFICE WITH PRINCIPAL RESPONSIBILITY
LJ047-0170 ON NOVEMBER 5 HOSTY WAS TRAVELING NEAR MRS. PAINE'S HOME AND TOOK THE OCCASION TO STOP BY TO ASK WHETHER SHE HAD ANY FURTHER INFORMATION
LJ047-0171 MRS. PAINE HAD NOTHING TO ADD TO WHAT SHE HAD ALREADY TOLD HIM EXCEPT THAT DURING A VISIT THAT PAST WEEKEND
LJ047-0172 OSWALD HAD SAID THAT HE WAS A QUOTE TROTSKYITE COMMUNIST END QUOTE
LJ047-0173 AND THAT SHE FOUND THIS AND SIMILAR STATEMENTS ILLOGICAL AND SOMEWHAT AMUSING. ON THIS OCCASION HOSTY WAS AT THE PAINE RESIDENCE FOR ONLY A FEW MINUTES
LJ047-0174 DURING NEITHER INTERVIEW DID HOSTY LEARN OSWALD'S ADDRESS
LJ047-0175 OR TELEPHONE NUMBER IN DALLAS MRS. PAINE TESTIFIED THAT SHE LEARNED OSWALD'S TELEPHONE NUMBER AT THE BECKLEY STREET ROOMINGHOUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF OCTOBER
LJ047-0176 SHORTLY AFTER OSWALD RENTED THE ROOM ON OCTOBER FOURTEEN
LJ047-0177 AS DISCUSSED IN CHAPTER 6 SHE FAILED TO REPORT THIS TO AGENT HOSTY
LJ047-0178 BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT THE FBI WAS IN POSSESSION OF A GREAT DEAL OF INFORMATION AND CERTAINLY WOULD FIND IT VERY EASY TO LEARN WHERE OSWALD WAS LIVING
LJ047-0179 HOSTY DID NOTHING FURTHER IN CONNECTION WITH THE OSWALD CASE UNTIL AFTER THE ASSASSINATION. ON NOVEMBER ONE NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ047-0180 HE HAD RECEIVED A COPY OF THE REPORT OF THE NEW ORLEANS OFFICE WHICH CONTAINED AGENT QUIGLEY'S MEMORANDUM OF THE INTERVIEW IN THE NEW ORLEANS JAIL ON AUGUST TEN
LJ047-0181 AND REALIZED IMMEDIATELY THAT OSWALD HAD GIVEN FALSE BIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION. HOSTY KNEW THAT HE WOULD EVENTUALLY HAVE TO INVESTIGATE THIS AND QUOTE
LJ047-0182 WAS QUITE INTERESTED IN DETERMINING THE NATURE OF HIS CONTACT WITH THE SOVIET EMBASSY IN MEXICO CITY END QUOTE
LJ047-0183 WHEN ASKED WHAT HIS NEXT STEP WOULD HAVE BEEN HOSTY REPLIED QUOTE
LJ047-0184 WELL AS I HAD PREVIOUSLY STATED I HAVE BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND FORTY CASES ASSIGNED TO ME AT ANY ONE TIME I HAD OTHER MATTERS TO TAKE CARE OF
LJ047-0185 I HAD NOW ESTABLISHED THAT LEE OSWALD WAS NOT EMPLOYED IN A SENSITIVE INDUSTRY
LJ047-0186 I CAN NOW AFFORD TO WAIT UNTIL NEW ORLEANS FORWARDED THE NECESSARY PAPERS TO ME TO SHOW ME I NOW HAD ALL THE INFORMATION
LJ047-0187 IT WAS THEN MY PLAN TO INTERVIEW MARINA OSWALD IN DETAIL CONCERNING BOTH HERSELF AND HER HUSBAND'S BACKGROUND QUESTION
LJ047-0188 HAD YOU PLANNED ANY STEPS BEYOND THAT POINT
LJ047-0189 ANSWER NO. I WOULD HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL I HAD TALKED TO MARINA TO SEE WHAT I COULD DETERMINE AND FROM THERE I COULD MAKE MY PLANS
LJ047-0190 QUESTION DID YOU TAKE ANY ACTION ON THIS CASE BETWEEN NOVEMBER FIVE AND NOVEMBER TWENTY TWO ANSWER NO SIR
LJ047-0191 THE OFFICIAL BUREAU FILES CONFIRM HOSTY'S STATEMENT THAT FROM NOVEMBER 5 UNTIL THE ASSASSINATION NO ACTIVE INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED
LJ047-0192 ON NOVEMBER EIGHTEEN THE FBI LEARNED THAT OSWALD RECENTLY HAD BEEN IN COMMUNICATION WITH THE SOVIET EMBASSY IN WASHINGTON
LJ047-0193 AND SO ADVISED THE DALLAS OFFICE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS
LJ047-0194 HOSTY RECEIVED THIS INFORMATION ON THE AFTERNOON OF NOVEMBER TWENTY TWO NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ047-0195 NONREFERRAL OF OSWALD TO THE SECRET SERVICE
LJ047-0196 THE COMMISSION HAS CONSIDERED CAREFULLY THE QUESTION WHETHER THE FBI
LJ047-0197 IN VIEW OF ALL THE INFORMATION CONCERNING OSWALD IN ITS FILES SHOULD HAVE ALERTED THE SECRET SERVICE TO OSWALD'S PRESENCE IN DALLAS
LJ047-0198 PRIOR TO PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S VISIT
LJ047-0199 THE SECRET SERVICE AND THE FBI DIFFER
LJ047-0200 AS TO WHETHER OSWALD FELL WITHIN THE CATEGORY OF QUOTE THREATS AGAINST THE PRESIDENT END QUOTE WHICH SHOULD BE REFERRED TO THE SERVICE
LJ047-0201 ROBERT I BOUCK SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE OF THE PROTECTIVE RESEARCH SECTION
LJ047-0202 TESTIFIED THAT THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ABOUT OSWALD BEFORE THE ASSASSINATION WOULD IF KNOWN TO PRS
LJ047-0203 HAVE MADE OSWALD A SUBJECT OF CONCERN TO THE SECRET SERVICE
LJ047-0204 BOUCK POINTED TO A NUMBER OF CHARACTERISTICS BESIDES OSWALD'S DEFECTION THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN TO ALERT THE SECRET SERVICE
LJ047-0205 TO POTENTIAL DANGER QUOTE
LJ047-0206 I WOULD THINK HIS CONTINUED ASSOCIATION WITH THE RUSSIAN EMBASSY AFTER HIS RETURN
LJ047-0207 HIS ASSOCIATION WITH THE CASTRO GROUPS WOULD HAVE BEEN OF CONCERN TO US A KNOWLEDGE THAT HE HAD I BELIEVE
LJ047-0208 BEEN COURTMARTIALED FOR ILLEGAL POSSESSION OF A GUN OF A HANDGUN IN THE MARINES
LJ047-0209 THAT HE HAD OWNED A WEAPON AND DID A GOOD DEAL OF HUNTING OR USE OF IT PERHAPS IN RUSSIA PLUS A NUMBER OF ITEMS ABOUT HIS DISPOSITION AND UNRELIABILITY OF CHARACTER
LJ047-0210 I THINK ALL OF THOSE IF WE HAD THEM ALL TOGETHER
LJ047-0211 WOULD HAVE ADDED UP TO POINTING OUT A PRETTY BAD INDIVIDUAL AND I THINK THAT TOGETHER HAD WE KNOWN THAT HE HAD A VANTAGE POINT
LJ047-0212 WOULD HAVE SEEMED SOMEWHAT SERIOUS TO US EVEN THOUGH I MUST ADMIT THAT NONE OF THESE IN THEMSELVES WOULD BE
LJ047-0213 WOULD MEET OUR SPECIFIC CRITERIA NONE OF THEM ALONE. BUT IT IS WHEN YOU BEGIN ADDING THEM UP TO SOME DEGREE THAT YOU BEGIN TO GET CRITERIA THAT ARE MEANINGFUL
LJ047-0214 END QUOTE. MR. BOUCK POINTED OUT HOWEVER THAT HE HAD NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT ANY ONE FEDERAL AGENCY HAD ACCESS TO ALL THIS INFORMATION
LJ047-0215 INCLUDING THE SIGNIFICANT FACT THAT OSWALD WAS EMPLOYED IN A BUILDING WHICH OVERLOOKED THE MOTORCADE ROUTE
LJ047-0216 AGENT HOSTY TESTIFIED THAT HE WAS FULLY AWARE OF THE PENDING PRESIDENTIAL VISIT TO DALLAS
LJ047-0217 HE RECALLED THAT THE SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE OF THE DALLAS OFFICE OF THE FBI J. GORDON SHANKLIN
LJ047-0218 HAD DISCUSSED THE PRESIDENT'S VISIT ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS INCLUDING THE REGULAR BIWEEKLY CONFERENCE ON THE MORNING OF NOVEMBER 22
LJ047-0219 QUOTE MR. SHANKLIN ADVISED US AMONG OTHER THINGS
LJ047-0220 THAT IN VIEW OF THE PRESIDENT'S VISIT TO DALLAS THAT IF ANYONE HAD ANY INDICATION OF ANY POSSIBILITY OF ANY ACTS OF VIOLENCE OR ANY DEMONSTRATIONS AGAINST THE PRESIDENT
LJ047-0221 OR VICE PRESIDENT TO IMMEDIATELY NOTIFY THE SECRET SERVICE AND CONFIRM IT IN WRITING
LJ047-0222 HE HAD MADE THE SAME STATEMENT ABOUT A WEEK PRIOR AT ANOTHER SPECIAL CONFERENCE WHICH WE HAD HELD
LJ047-0223 I DON'T RECALL THE EXACT DATE. IT WAS ABOUT A WEEK PRIOR. END QUOTE
LJ047-0224 IN FACT HOSTY PARTICIPATED IN TRANSMITTING TO THE SECRET SERVICE TWO PIECES OF INFORMATION PERTAINING TO THE VISIT
LJ047-0225 HOSTY TESTIFIED THAT HE DID NOT KNOW UNTIL THE EVENING OF THURSDAY NOVEMBER TWENTY ONE THAT THERE WAS TO BE A MOTORCADE HOWEVER
LJ047-0226 AND NEVER REALIZED THAT THE MOTORCADE WOULD PASS THE TEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY BUILDING
LJ047-0227 HE TESTIFIED THAT HE DID NOT READ THE NEWSPAPER STORY DESCRIBING THE MOTORCADE ROUTE IN DETAIL SINCE HE WAS INTERESTED ONLY IN THE FACT
LJ047-0228 THAT THE MOTORCADE WAS COMING UP MAIN STREET QUOTE WHERE MAYBE I COULD WATCH IT IF I HAD A CHANCE END QUOTE
LJ047-0229 EVEN IF HE HAD RECALLED THAT OSWALD'S PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT WAS ON THE PRESIDENT'S ROUTE
LJ047-0230 HOSTY TESTIFIED THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE CITED HIM TO THE SECRET SERVICE AS A POTENTIAL THREAT TO THE PRESIDENT. HOSTY INTERPRETED HIS INSTRUCTIONS AS REQUIRING QUOTE
LJ047-0231 SOME INDICATION THAT THE PERSON PLANNED TO TAKE SOME ACTION AGAINST THE SAFETY OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OR THE VICE PRESIDENT. END QUOTE
LJ047-0232 IN HIS OPINION NONE OF THE INFORMATION IN THE FBI FILES  OSWALD'S DEFECTION HIS FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA ACTIVITIES IN NEW ORLEANS
LJ047-0233 HIS LIES TO AGENT QUIGLEY HIS RECENT VISIT TO MEXICO CITY  INDICATED THAT OSWALD WAS CAPABLE OF VIOLENCE
LJ047-0234 HOSTY'S INITIAL REACTION ON HEARING THAT OSWALD WAS A SUSPECT IN THE ASSASSINATION WAS QUOTE SHOCK
LJ047-0235 COMPLETE SURPRISE END QUOTE BECAUSE HE HAD NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT OSWALD QUOTE
LJ047-0236 WAS CAPABLE OR POTENTIALLY AN ASSASSIN OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES END QUOTE
LJ047-0237 SHORTLY AFTER OSWALD WAS APPREHENDED AND IDENTIFIED HOSTY'S SUPERIOR SENT HIM TO OBSERVE THE INTERROGATION OF OSWALD
LJ047-0238 HOSTY PARKED HIS CAR IN THE BASEMENT OF POLICE HEADQUARTERS AND THERE MET AN ACQUAINTANCE LT JACK REVILL OF THE DALLAS POLICE FORCE
LJ047-0239 THE TWO MEN DISAGREE ABOUT THE CONVERSATION WHICH TOOK PLACE BETWEEN THEM
LJ047-0240 THEY AGREE THAT HOSTY TOLD REVILL
LJ047-0241 THAT THE FBI HAD KNOWN ABOUT OSWALD AND IN PARTICULAR OF HIS PRESENCE IN DALLAS AND HIS EMPLOYMENT AT THE TEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY BUILDING
LJ047-0242 REVILL TESTIFIED THAT HOSTY SAID ALSO THAT THE FBI HAD INFORMATION THAT OSWALD WAS QUOTE CAPABLE OF COMMITTING THIS ASSASSINATION END QUOTE
LJ047-0243 ACCORDING TO REVILL HOSTY INDICATED THAT HE WAS GOING TO TELL THIS TO LIEUTENANT WELLS OF THE HOMICIDE AND ROBBERY BUREAU
LJ047-0244 REVILL PROMPTLY MADE A MEMORANDUM OF THIS CONVERSATION IN WHICH THE QUOTED STATEMENT APPEARS
LJ047-0245 HIS SECRETARY TESTIFIED THAT SHE PREPARED SUCH A REPORT FOR HIM THAT AFTERNOON AND CHIEF OF POLICE JESSE E. CURRY
LJ047-0246 AND DISTRICT ATTORNEY HENRY M. WADE BOTH TESTIFIED THAT THEY SAW IT LATER THAT DAY
LJ047-0247 HOSTY HAS UNEQUIVOCALLY DENIED FIRST BY AFFIDAVIT AND THEN IN HIS TESTIMONY BEFORE THE COMMISSION
LJ047-0248 THAT HE EVER SAID THAT OSWALD WAS CAPABLE OF VIOLENCE OR THAT HE HAD ANY INFORMATION SUGGESTING THIS
LJ047-0249 THE ONLY WITNESS TO THE CONVERSATION WAS DALLAS POLICE DETECTIVE V. J. BRIAN WHO WAS ACCOMPANYING REVILL
LJ047-0250 BRIAN DID NOT HEAR HOSTY MAKE ANY STATEMENT CONCERNING OSWALD'S CAPACITY TO BE AN ASSASSIN
LJ048-0001 REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION ON THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY. THE WARREN COMMISSION REPORT. BY THE PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION ON THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY
LJ048-0002 CHAPTER EIGHT THE PROTECTION OF THE PRESIDENT PART THREE
LJ048-0003 HOSTY'S INTERPRETATION OF THE PREVAILING FBI INSTRUCTIONS ON REFERRALS TO THE SECRET SERVICE WAS DEFENDED BEFORE THE COMMISSION BY HIS SUPERIORS
LJ048-0004 AFTER SUMMARIZING THE BUREAU'S INVESTIGATIVE INTEREST IN OSWALD PRIOR TO THE ASSASSINATION J. EDGAR HOOVER CONCLUDED THAT QUOTE
LJ048-0005 THERE WAS NOTHING UP TO THE TIME OF THE ASSASSINATION THAT GAVE ANY INDICATION THAT THIS MAN WAS A DANGEROUS CHARACTER WHO MIGHT DO HARM TO THE PRESIDENT
LJ048-0006 OR TO THE VICE PRESIDENT END QUOTE
LJ048-0007 DIRECTOR HOOVER EMPHASIZED THAT THE FIRST INDICATION OF OSWALD'S CAPACITY FOR VIOLENCE
LJ048-0008 WAS HIS ATTEMPT ON GENERAL WALKER'S LIFE WHICH DID NOT BECOME KNOWN TO THE FBI UNTIL AFTER THE ASSASSINATION
LJ048-0009 BOTH DIRECTOR HOOVER AND HIS ASSISTANT ALAN H. BELMONT
LJ048-0010 STRESSED ALSO THE DECISION BY THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE THAT OSWALD SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO RETURN TO THE UNITED STATES
LJ048-0011 NEITHER BELIEVED THAT THE BUREAU INVESTIGATION OF HIM UP TO NOVEMBER 22 REVEALED ANY INFORMATION WHICH WOULD HAVE JUSTIFIED REFERRAL TO THE SECRET SERVICE
LJ048-0012 ACCORDING TO BELMONT WHEN OSWALD RETURNED FROM THE SOVIET UNION QUOTE
LJ048-0013 HE INDICATED THAT HE HAD LEARNED HIS LESSON
LJ048-0014 WAS DISENCHANTED WITH RUSSIA AND HAD A RENEWED CONCEPT  I AM PARAPHRASING A RENEWED CONCEPT  OF THE AMERICAN FREE SOCIETY
LJ048-0015 WE TALKED TO HIM TWICE
LJ048-0016 HE LIKEWISE INDICATED HE WAS DISENCHANTED WITH RUSSIA
LJ048-0017 WE SATISFIED OURSELVES THAT WE HAD MET OUR REQUIREMENT NAMELY TO FIND OUT WHETHER HE HAD BEEN RECRUITED BY SOVIET INTELLIGENCE. THE CASE WAS CLOSED
LJ048-0018 WE AGAIN EXHIBITED INTEREST ON THE BASIS OF THESE CONTACTS WITH THE WORKER FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE WHICH ARE RELATIVELY INCONSEQUENTIAL
LJ048-0019 HIS ACTIVITIES FOR THE FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE IN NEW ORLEANS WE KNEW WERE NOT OF REAL CONSEQUENCE AS HE WAS NOT CONNECTED WITH ANY ORGANIZED ACTIVITY THERE
LJ048-0020 THE INTERVIEW WITH HIM IN JAIL IS NOT SIGNIFICANT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF WHETHER HE HAD A PROPENSITY FOR VIOLENCE
LJ048-0021 QUESTION THIS IS THE QUIGLEY INTERVIEW YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT
LJ048-0022 ANSWER YES. IT WAS A SELFSERVING INTERVIEW. THE VISITS WITH THE SOVIET EMBASSY WERE EVIDENTLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF SECURING A VISA
LJ048-0023 AND HE HAD TOLD US DURING ONE OF THE INTERVIEWS THAT HE WOULD PROBABLY TAKE HIS WIFE BACK TO SOVIET RUSSIA SOME TIME IN THE FUTURE
LJ048-0024 HE HAD COME BACK TO DALLAS HOSTY HAD ESTABLISHED THAT HE HAD A JOB HE WAS WORKING
LJ048-0025 AND HAD TOLD MRS. PAINE THAT WHEN HE GOT THE MONEY HE WAS GOING TO TAKE AN APARTMENT WHEN THE BABY WAS OLD ENOUGH HE WAS GOING TO TAKE AN APARTMENT AND THE FAMILY WOULD LIVE TOGETHER
LJ048-0026 HE GAVE EVIDENCE OF SETTLING DOWN
LJ048-0027 NOWHERE DURING THE COURSE OF THIS INVESTIGATION OR THE INFORMATION THAT CAME TO US FROM OTHER AGENCIES WAS THERE ANY INDICATION OF A POTENTIAL FOR VIOLENCE ON HIS PART
LJ048-0028 CONSEQUENTLY THERE WAS NO BASIS FOR HOSTY TO GO TO SECRET SERVICE AND ADVISE THEM OF OSWALD'S PRESENCE. END QUOTE
LJ048-0029 AS REFLECTED IN THIS TESTIMONY
LJ048-0030 THE OFFICIALS OF THE FBI BELIEVED THAT THERE WAS NO DATA IN ITS FILES WHICH GAVE WARNING THAT OSWALD WAS A SOURCE OF DANGER TO PRESIDENT KENNEDY
LJ048-0031 WHILE HE HAD EXPRESSED HOSTILITY AT TIMES TOWARD THE STATE DEPARTMENT THE MARINE CORPS AND THE FBI AS AGENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT
LJ048-0032 SO FAR AS THE FBI KNEW HE HAD NOT SHOWN ANY POTENTIAL FOR VIOLENCE
LJ048-0033 PRIOR TO NOVEMBER 22 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ048-0034 NO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY HAD ANY INFORMATION TO CONNECT OSWALD WITH THE ATTEMPTED SHOOTING OF GENERAL WALKER
LJ048-0035 IT WAS AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND AND CONSISTENT WITH THE CRITERIA FOLLOWED BY THE FBI PRIOR TO NOVEMBER 22
LJ048-0036 THAT AGENTS OF THE FBI IN DALLAS DID NOT CONSIDER OSWALD'S PRESENCE IN THE TEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY BUILDING
LJ048-0037 OVERLOOKING THE MOTORCADE ROUTE AS A SOURCE OF DANGER TO THE PRESIDENT AND DID NOT INFORM THE SECRET SERVICE OF HIS EMPLOYMENT IN THE DEPOSITORY BUILDING
LJ048-0038 THE COMMISSION BELIEVES HOWEVER
LJ048-0039 THAT THE FBI TOOK AN UNDULY RESTRICTIVE VIEW OF ITS RESPONSIBILITIES IN PREVENTIVE INTELLIGENCE WORK PRIOR TO THE ASSASSINATION
LJ048-0040 THE COMMISSION APPRECIATES THE LARGE VOLUME OF CASES HANDLED BY THE FBI
LJ048-0041 636371 INVESTIGATIVE MATTERS DURING FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ048-0042 THERE WERE NO SECRET SERVICE CRITERIA WHICH SPECIFICALLY REQUIRED THE REFERRAL OF OSWALD'S CASE TO THE SECRET SERVICE
LJ048-0043 NOR WAS THERE ANY REQUIREMENT TO REPORT THE NAMES OF DEFECTORS. HOWEVER THERE WAS MUCH MATERIAL IN THE HANDS OF THE FBI ABOUT OSWALD
LJ048-0044 THE KNOWLEDGE OF HIS DEFECTION HIS ARROGANCE AND HOSTILITY TO THE UNITED STATES
LJ048-0045 HIS PROCASTRO TENDENCIES HIS LIES WHEN INTERROGATED BY THE FBI
LJ048-0046 HIS TRIP TO MEXICO WHERE HE WAS IN CONTACT WITH SOVIET AUTHORITIES
LJ048-0047 HIS PRESENCE IN THE SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY JOB AND ITS LOCATION ALONG THE ROUTE OF THE MOTORCADE
LJ048-0048 ALL THIS DOES SEEM TO AMOUNT TO ENOUGH TO HAVE INDUCED AN ALERT AGENCY SUCH AS THE FBI
LJ048-0049 POSSESSED OF THIS INFORMATION TO LIST OSWALD AS A POTENTIAL THREAT TO THE SAFETY OF THE PRESIDENT
LJ048-0050 THIS CONCLUSION MAY BE TINGED WITH HINDSIGHT BUT
LJ048-0051 IT STATED PRIMARILY TO DIRECT THE THOUGHT OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FUTURE SAFETY OF OUR PRESIDENTS TO THE NEED FOR A MORE IMAGINATIVE
LJ048-0052 AND LESS NARROW INTERPRETATION OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES
LJ048-0053 IT IS THE CONCLUSION OF THE COMMISSION THAT EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF SECRET SERVICE CRITERIA
LJ048-0054 WHICH SPECIFICALLY REQUIRED THE REFERRAL OF SUCH A CASE AS OSWALD'S TO THE SECRET SERVICE
LJ048-0055 A MORE ALERT AND CAREFULLY CONSIDERED TREATMENT OF THE OSWALD CASE BY THE BUREAU MIGHT HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT SUCH A REFERRAL
LJ048-0056 HAD SUCH A REVIEW BEEN UNDERTAKEN BY THE FBI
LJ048-0057 THERE MIGHT CONCEIVABLY HAVE BEEN ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION OF THE OSWALD CASE BETWEEN NOVEMBER FIVE AND NOVEMBER TWENTY TWO
LJ048-0058 AGENT HOSTY TESTIFIED
LJ048-0059 THAT SEVERAL MATTERS BROUGHT TO HIS ATTENTION IN LATE OCTOBER AND EARLY NOVEMBER INCLUDING THE VISIT TO THE SOVIET EMBASSY IN MEXICO CITY
LJ048-0060 REQUIRED FURTHER ATTENTION
LJ048-0061 UNDER PROPER PROCEDURES KNOWLEDGE OF THE PENDING PRESIDENTIAL VISIT MIGHT HAVE PROMPTED HOSTY
LJ048-0062 TO HAVE MADE MORE VIGOROUS EFFORTS TO LOCATE OSWALD'S ROOMINGHOUSE ADDRESS IN DALLAS AND TO INTERVIEW HIM REGARDING THESE UNRESOLVED MATTERS
LJ048-0063 THE FORMAL FBI INSTRUCTIONS TO ITS AGENTS OUTLINING THE INFORMATION TO BE REFERRED TO THE SECRET SERVICE WERE TOO NARROW AT THE TIME OF THE ASSASSINATION
LJ048-0064 WHILE THE SECRET SERVICE BEARS THE PRINCIPAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS FAILURE
LJ048-0065 THE FBI INSTRUCTIONS DID NOT REFLECT FULLY THE SECRET SERVICE'S NEED FOR INFORMATION REGARDING POTENTIAL THREATS
LJ048-0066 THE HANDBOOK REFERRED THUS TO QUOTE THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ATTEMPT AGAINST THE PERSON OR SAFETY OF THE PRESIDENT END QUOTE
LJ048-0067 IT IS CLEAR FROM HOSTY'S TESTIMONY THAT THIS WAS CONSTRUED AT LEAST BY HIM
LJ048-0068 AS REQUIRING EVIDENCE OF A PLAN OR CONSPIRACY TO INJURE THE PRESIDENT
LJ048-0069 EFFORTS MADE BY THE BUREAU SINCE THE ASSASSINATION ON THE OTHER HAND
LJ048-0070 REFLECT KEEN AWARENESS OF THE NECESSITY OF COMMUNICATING A MUCH WIDER RANGE OF INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION TO THE SERVICE
LJ048-0071 MOST IMPORTANT NOTWITHSTANDING THAT BOTH AGENCIES HAVE PROFESSED TO THE COMMISSION THAT THE LIAISON BETWEEN THEM WAS CLOSE AND FULLY SUFFICIENT
LJ048-0072 THE COMMISSION DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE LIAISON BETWEEN THE FBI AND THE SECRET SERVICE PRIOR TO THE ASSASSINATION WAS AS EFFECTIVE AS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
LJ048-0073 THE FBI MANUAL OF INSTRUCTIONS PROVIDED QUOTE LIAISON WITH OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES
LJ048-0074 TO INSURE ADEQUATE AND EFFECTIVE LIAISON ARRANGEMENTS
LJ048-0075 EACH SAC SHOULD SPECIFICALLY DESIGNATE AN AGENT OR AGENTS TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING
LJ048-0076 AND MAINTAINING LIAISON WITH OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES. THIS LIAISON SHOULD TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION
LJ048-0077 FBIAGENCY COMMUNITY OF INTERESTS LOCATION OF AGENCY HEAD QUARTERS AND THE RESPONSIVENESS OF AGENCY REPRESENTATIVES
LJ048-0078 IN EACH INSTANCE LIAISON CONTACTS SHOULD BE DEVELOPED TO INCLUDE A CLOSE FRIENDLY RELATIONSHIP
LJ048-0079 MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING OF FBI AND AGENCY JURISDICTIONS AND AN INDICATED WILLINGNESS BY THE AGENCY REPRESENTATIVE
LJ048-0080 TO COORDINATE ACTIVITIES AND TO DISCUSS PROBLEMS OF MUTUAL INTEREST
LJ048-0081 EACH FIELD OFFICE SHOULD DETERMINE THOSE FEDERAL AGENCIES WHICH ARE REPRESENTED LOCALLY AND WITH WHICH LIAISON SHOULD BE CONDUCTED. END QUOTE
LJ048-0082 THE TESTIMONY REVEALS THAT LIAISON RESPONSIBILITIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE PRESIDENT'S VISIT
LJ048-0083 WERE DISCUSSED TWICE OFFICIALLY BY THE SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE OF THE FBI OFFICE IN DALLAS AS DISCUSSED IN CHAPTER TWO
LJ048-0084 SOME LIMITED INFORMATION WAS MADE AVAILABLE TO THE SECRET SERVICE. BUT THERE WAS NO FULLY ADEQUATE LIAISON BETWEEN THE TWO AGENCIES INDEED
LJ048-0085 THE COMMISSION BELIEVES THAT THE LIAISON BETWEEN ALL FEDERAL AGENCIES RESPONSIBLE FOR PRESIDENTIAL PROTECTION SHOULD BE IMPROVED
LJ048-0086 OTHER PROTECTIVE MEASURES AND ASPECTS OF SECRET SERVICE PERFORMANCE
LJ048-0087 THE PRESIDENT'S TRIP TO DALLAS CALLED INTO PLAY MANY STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES OF THE SECRET SERVICE IN ADDITION TO ITS PREVENTIVE INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS
LJ048-0088 EXAMINATION OF THESE PROCEDURES SHOWS THAT IN MOST RESPECTS THEY WERE WELL CONCEIVED AND ABLY EXECUTED BY THE PERSONNEL OF THE SERVICE
LJ048-0089 AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF THE CRITICAL EVENTS OF NOVEMBER TWENTY TWO HOWEVER
LJ048-0090 CERTAIN SHORTCOMINGS AND LAPSES FROM THE HIGH STANDARDS WHICH THE COMMISSION BELIEVES SHOULD PREVAIL IN THE FIELD OF PRESIDENTIAL PROTECTION ARE EVIDENT
LJ048-0091 ADVANCE PREPARATIONS
LJ048-0092 THE ADVANCE PREPARATIONS IN DALLAS BY AGENT WINSTON G. LAWSON OF THE WHITE HOUSE DETAIL HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED IN CHAPTER TWO
LJ048-0093 WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF AGENT IN CHARGE SORRELS OF THE DALLAS FIELD OFFICE OF THE SECRET SERVICE
LJ048-0094 LAWSON WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR WORKING OUT A GREAT MANY ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE PRESIDENT'S TRIP
LJ048-0095 THE SERVICE PREFERS TO HAVE TWO AGENTS PERFORM ADVANCE PREPARATIONS
LJ048-0096 IN THE CASE OF DALLAS BECAUSE PRESIDENT KENNEDY HAD SCHEDULED VISITS TO FIVE TEXAS CITIES
LJ048-0097 AND HAD ALSO SCHEDULED VISITS TO OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE TEXAS TRIP
LJ048-0098 THERE WERE NOT ENOUGH MEN AVAILABLE TO PERMIT TWO AGENTS TO BE ASSIGNED TO ALL THE ADVANCE WORK
LJ048-0099 AGENT LAWSON DID THE ADVANCE WORK ALONE FROM NOVEMBER THIRTEEN TO NOVEMBER EIGHTEEN WHEN HE WAS JOINED BY AGENT DAVID B. GRANT
LJ048-0100 WHO HAD JUST COMPLETED ADVANCE WORK ON THE PRESIDENT'S TRIP TO TAMPA
LJ048-0101 THE COMMISSION CONCLUDES THAT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ADVANCE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE PRESIDENT'S TRIP WERE SOUNDLY PLANNED
LJ048-0102 IN PARTICULAR THE COMMISSION BELIEVES THAT THE MOTORCADE ROUTE SELECTED BY AGENT LAWSON UPON THE ADVICE OF AGENT IN CHARGE SORRELS
LJ048-0103 AND WITH THE CONCURRENCE OF THE DALLAS POLICE WAS ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE IN VIEW OF THE KNOWN DESIRES OF THE PRESIDENT
LJ048-0104 THERE WERE FAR SAFER ROUTES VIA FREEWAYS DIRECTLY TO THE TRADE MART
LJ048-0105 BUT THESE ROUTES WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE WHITE HOUSE STAFF INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN THE SECRET SERVICE FOR A DESIRABLE MOTORCADE ROUTE
LJ048-0106 MUCH OF LAWSON'S TIME WAS TAKEN WITH ESTABLISHING ADEQUATE SECURITY OVER THE MOTORCADE ROUTE AND AT THE TWO PLACES WHERE THE PRESIDENT WOULD STOP
LJ048-0107 LOVE FIELD AND THE TRADE MART
LJ048-0109 BY THESE SECRET SERVICE AGENTS WITH THE COOPERATION OF THE DALLAS POLICE AND OTHER LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENTS WERE CAREFULLY EXECUTED
LJ048-0110 SINCE THE PRESIDENT WAS TO BE AT THE TRADE MART LONGER THAN AT ANY OTHER LOCATION IN DALLAS AND IN VIEW OF THE SECURITY HAZARDS PRESENTED BY THE BUILDING
LJ048-0111 THE SECRET SERVICE CORRECTLY GAVE PARTICULAR ATTENTION IN THE ADVANCE PREPARATIONS TO THOSE ARRANGEMENTS
LJ048-0112 THE COMMISSION ALSO REGARDS THE SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS WORKED OUT BY LAWSON AND SORRELS AT LOVE FIELD AS ENTIRELY ADEQUATE
LJ048-0113 THE COMMISSION BELIEVES HOWEVER
LJ048-0114 THAT THE SECRET SERVICE HAS INADEQUATELY DEFINED THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF ITS ADVANCE AGENTS WHO HAVE BEEN GIVEN BROAD DISCRETION
LJ048-0115 TO DETERMINE WHAT MATTERS REQUIRE ATTENTION IN MAKING ADVANCE PREPARATIONS AND TO DECIDE WHAT ACTION TO TAKE
LJ048-0116 AGENT LAWSON WAS NOT GIVEN WRITTEN INSTRUCTIONS CONCERNING THE DALLAS TRIP OR ADVICE ABOUT ANY PECULIAR PROBLEMS WHICH IT MIGHT INVOLVE
LJ048-0117 ALL INSTRUCTIONS FROM HIGHER AUTHORITY WERE COMMUNICATED TO HIM ORALLY
LJ048-0118 HE DID NOT HAVE A CHECKLIST OF THE TASKS HE WAS EXPECTED TO ACCOMPLISH EITHER BY HIS OWN EFFORTS OR WITH THE COOPERATION OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES
LJ048-0119 THE ONLY SYSTEMATIC SUPERVISION OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE ADVANCE AGENT
LJ048-0120 HAS BEEN THAT PROVIDED BY A REQUIREMENT THAT HE FILE INTERIM AND FINAL REPORTS ON EACH ADVANCE ASSIGNMENT
LJ048-0121 THE INTERIM REPORT MUST BE IN THE HANDS OF THE AGENT SUPERVISING THE PROTECTIVE GROUP TRAVELING WITH THE PRESIDENT
LJ048-0122 LONG ENOUGH BEFORE HIS DEPARTURE TO APPRISE HIM OF ANY PARTICULAR PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED AND THE RESPONSIVE ACTION TAKEN
LJ048-0123 AGENT LAWSON'S INTERIM REPORT WAS RECEIVED BY AGENT KELLERMAN ON NOVEMBER 20 THE DAY BEFORE DEPARTURE ON THE TEXAS TRIP
LJ048-0124 THE SECRET SERVICE HAS ADVISED THE COMMISSION THAT NO UNUSUAL PRECAUTIONS WERE TAKEN FOR THE DALLAS TRIP AND THAT QUOTE
LJ048-0125 THE PRECAUTIONS TAKEN FOR THE PRESIDENT'S TRIP WERE THE USUAL SAFEGUARDS EMPLOYED ON TRIPS OF THIS KIND IN THE UNITED STATES DURING THE PREVIOUS YEAR END QUOTE
LJ048-0126 SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE SORRELS TESTIFIED THAT THE ADVANCE PREPARATIONS FOLLOWED ON THIS OCCASION WERE QUOTE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME END QUOTE
LJ048-0127 AS THOSE FOLLOWED IN 1936 DURING A TRIP TO DALLAS BY PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT
LJ048-0128 WHICH WAS SORRELS' FIRST IMPORTANT ASSIGNMENT IN CONNECTION WITH PRESIDENTIAL WORK
LJ048-0129 IN VIEW OF THE CONSTANT CHANGE IN THE NATURE OF THREATS TO THE PRESIDENT AND THE DIVERSITY OF THE DANGERS WHICH MAY ARISE IN THE VARIOUS CITIES WITHIN THE UNITED STATES
LJ048-0130 THE COMMISSION BELIEVES THAT STANDARD PROCEDURES IN USE FOR MANY YEARS AND APPLIED IN ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT
LJ048-0131 THERE IS FOR EXAMPLE NO SECRET SERVICE ARRANGEMENT FOR EVALUATING BEFORE A TRIP PARTICULAR DIFFICULTIES THAT MIGHT BE ANTICIPATED
LJ048-0132 WHICH WOULD BRING TO BEAR THE JUDGMENT AND EXPERIENCE OF MEMBERS OF THE WHITE HOUSE DETAIL OTHER THAN THE ADVANCE AGENT
LJ048-0133 CONSTANT REEVALUATION OF PROCEDURES WITH ATTENTION TO SPECIAL PROBLEMS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF INSTRUCTIONS SPECIFIC TO PARTICULAR TRIPS
LJ048-0134 WOULD BE A DESIRABLE INNOVATION
LJ048-0135 LIAISON WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES
LJ048-0136 IN THE DESCRIPTION OF THE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THE ADVANCE PREPARATIONS
LJ048-0137 THERE HAVE BEEN REFERENCES TO THE NUMEROUS DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN SECRET SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES AND THE DALLAS POLICE DEPARTMENT
LJ048-0138 THE WHOLEHEARTED SUPPORT OF THESE LOCAL AUTHORITIES WAS INDISPENSABLE TO THE SERVICE IN CARRYING OUT ITS DUTIES
LJ048-0139 THE SERVICE HAD TWENTY EIGHT AGENTS PARTICIPATING IN THE DALLAS VISIT
LJ048-0140 AGENT LAWSON'S ADVANCE PLANNING CALLED FOR THE DEPLOYMENT OF ALMOST 600 MEMBERS OF THE DALLAS POLICE DEPARTMENT
LJ048-0141 FIRE DEPARTMENT COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND THE TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY
LJ048-0142 DESPITE THIS DEPENDENCE ON LOCAL AUTHORITIES WHICH WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME ON A VISIT BY THE PRESIDENT TO ANY LARGE CITY
LJ048-0143 THE SECRET SERVICE DID NOT AT THE TIME OF THE ASSASSINATION HAVE ANY ESTABLISHED PROCEDURE GOVERNING ITS RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM
LJ048-0144 IT HAD NO PREPARED CHECKLIST OF MATTERS TO BE COVERED WITH LOCAL POLICE ON SUCH VISITS TO METROPOLITAN AREAS
LJ048-0145 AND NO WRITTEN DESCRIPTION OF THE ROLE THE LOCAL POLICE WERE EXPECTED TO PERFORM
LJ048-0146 DISCUSSIONS WITH THE DALLAS AUTHORITIES AND REQUESTS MADE OF THEM WERE ENTIRELY INFORMAL
LJ048-0147 THE COMMISSION BELIEVES
LJ048-0148 THAT A MORE FORMAL STATEMENT OF ASSIGNED RESPONSIBILITIES SUPPLEMENTED IN EACH CASE TO REFLECT THE PECULIAR CONDITIONS OF EACH PRESIDENTIAL TRIP
LJ048-0149 IS ESSENTIAL THIS WOULD HELP TO ELIMINATE VARYING INTERPRETATIONS OF SECRET SERVICE INSTRUCTIONS BY DIFFERENT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT REPRESENTATIVES. FOR EXAMPLE
LJ048-0150 WHILE THE SECRET SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES IN DALLAS
LJ048-0151 ASKED THE POLICE TO STATION GUARDS AT EACH OVERPASS TO KEEP QUOTE UNAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL END QUOTE OFF THIS TERM WAS NOT DEFINED
LJ048-0152 AT SOME OVERPASSES ALL PERSONS WERE EXCLUDED
LJ048-0153 WHILE ON THE OVERPASS OVERLOOKING THE ASSASSINATION SCENE RAILROAD AND YARD TERMINAL WORKMEN WERE PERMITTED TO REMAIN UNDER POLICE SUPERVISION
LJ048-0154 AS DISCUSSED IN CHAPTER THREE
LJ048-0155 ASSISTANT CHIEF BATCHELOR OF THE DALLAS POLICE NOTED THE ABSENCE OF ANY FORMAL STATEMENT BY THE SECRET SERVICE OF SPECIFIC WORK ASSIGNED TO THE POLICE
LJ048-0156 AND SUGGESTED THE DESIRABILITY OF SUCH A STATEMENT
LJ048-0157 AGENT LAWSON AGREED THAT SUCH A PROCEDURE WOULD ASSIST HIM AND OTHER AGENTS IN FULFILLING THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES AS ADVANCE AGENTS
LJ048-0158 CHECK OF BUILDINGS ALONG ROUTE OF MOTORCADE
LJ048-0159 AGENT LAWSON DID NOT ARRANGE FOR A PRIOR INSPECTION OF BUILDINGS ALONG THE MOTORCADE ROUTE
LJ048-0160 EITHER BY POLICE OR BY CUSTODIANS OF THE BUILDINGS SINCE IT WAS NOT THE USUAL PRACTICE OF THE SECRET SERVICE TO DO SO
LJ048-0161 THE CHIEF OF THE SERVICE HAS PROVIDED THE COMMISSION A DETAILED EXPLANATION OF THIS POLICY QUOTE
LJ048-0162 EXCEPT FOR INAUGURATION OR OTHER PARADES INVOLVING FOREIGN DIGNITARIES ACCOMPANIED BY THE PRESIDENT IN WASHINGTON
LJ048-0163 IT HAS NOT BEEN THE PRACTICE OF THE SECRET SERVICE TO MAKE SURVEYS OR CHECKS OF BUILDINGS ALONG THE ROUTE OF A PRESIDENTIAL MOTORCADE
LJ048-0164 FOR THE INAUGURATION AND CERTAIN OTHER PARADES IN WASHINGTON WHERE THE TRADITIONAL ROUTE IS KNOWN TO THE PUBLIC LONG IN ADVANCE OF THE EVENT
LJ048-0165 BUILDINGS ALONG THE ROUTE CAN BE CHECKED BY TEAMS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND ARMED GUARDS ARE POSTED ALONG THE ROUTE AS APPROPRIATE
LJ048-0166 BUT ON OUTOFTOWN TRIPS WHERE THE ROUTE IS DECIDED ON AND MADE PUBLIC ONLY A FEW DAYS IN ADVANCE
LJ048-0167 BUILDINGS ARE NOT CHECKED EITHER BY SECRET SERVICE AGENTS OR BY ANY OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AT THE REQUEST OF THE SECRET SERVICE
LJ048-0168 WITH THE NUMBER OF MEN AVAILABLE TO THE SECRET SERVICE AND THE TIME AVAILABLE SURVEYS OF HUNDREDS OF BUILDINGS AND THOUSANDS OF WINDOWS IS NOT PRACTICAL
LJ048-0169 IN DALLAS THE ROUTE SELECTED NECESSARILY INVOLVED PASSING THROUGH THE PRINCIPAL DOWNTOWN SECTION BETWEEN TALL BUILDINGS
LJ048-0170 WHILE CERTAIN STREETS THOUGHT TO BE TOO NARROW COULD BE AVOIDED AND OTHER CHOICES MADE
LJ048-0171 IT WAS NOT PRACTICAL TO SELECT A ROUTE WHERE THE PRESIDENT COULD NOT BE SEEN FROM ROOFS OR WINDOWS OF BUILDINGS
LJ048-0172 AT THE TWO PLACES IN DALLAS WHERE THE PRESIDENT WOULD REMAIN FOR A PERIOD OF TIME LOVE FIELD AND THE TRADE MART
LJ048-0173 ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE FOR BUILDING AND ROOF SECURITY BY POSTING POLICE OFFICERS WHERE APPROPRIATE
LJ048-0174 SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS FOR A MOTORCADE OF TEN MILES INCLUDING MANY BLOCKS OF TALL COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS IS NOT PRACTICAL
LJ048-0175 NOR IS IT PRACTICAL TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM ENTERING SUCH BUILDINGS OR TO LIMIT ACCESS IN EVERY BUILDING TO THOSE EMPLOYED OR HAVING BUSINESS THERE
LJ048-0176 EVEN IF IT WERE POSSIBLE WITH A VASTLY LARGER FORCE OF SECURITY OFFICERS TO DO SO MANY OBSERVERS HAVE FELT
LJ048-0177 THAT SUCH A PROCEDURE WOULD NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH THE NATURE AND PURPOSE OF THE MOTORCADE TO LET THE PEOPLE SEE THEIR PRESIDENT AND TO WELCOME HIM TO THEIR CITY
LJ048-0178 IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS REGULAR PROCEDURES NO SURVEY OR OTHER CHECK WAS MADE BY THE SECRET SERVICE OR BY ANY OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY AT ITS REQUEST
LJ048-0179 OF THE TEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY BUILDING OR THOSE EMPLOYED THERE PRIOR TO THE TIME THE PRESIDENT WAS SHOT END QUOTE
LJ048-0180 THIS JUSTIFICATION OF THE SECRET SERVICE'S STANDING POLICY IS NOT PERSUASIVE
LJ048-0181 THE DANGER FROM A CONCEALED SNIPER ON THE DALLAS TRIP WAS OF CONCERN TO THOSE WHO HAD CONSIDERED THE PROBLEM
LJ048-0182 PRESIDENT KENNEDY HIMSELF HAD MENTIONED IT THAT MORNING AS HAD AGENT SORRELS WHEN HE AND AGENT LAWSON WERE FIXING THE MOTORCADE ROUTE
LJ048-0183 ADMITTEDLY PROTECTIVE MEASURES CANNOT ORDINARILY BE TAKEN WITH REGARD TO ALL BUILDINGS ALONG A MOTORCADE ROUTE
LJ048-0184 LEVELS OF RISK CAN BE DETERMINED HOWEVER AS HAS BEEN CONFIRMED BY BUILDING SURVEYS MADE SINCE THE ASSASSINATION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY
LJ048-0185 AN ATTEMPT TO COVER ONLY THE MOST OBVIOUS POINTS OF POSSIBLE AMBUSH ALONG THE ROUTE IN DALLAS MIGHT WELL HAVE INCLUDED THE TEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY BUILDING
LJ048-0186 INSTEAD OF SUCH ADVANCE PRECAUTIONS THE SECRET SERVICE DEPENDED IN PART ON THE EFFORTS OF LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL STATIONED ALONG THE ROUTE
LJ048-0187 IN ADDITION SECRET SERVICE AGENTS RIDING IN THE MOTORCADE WERE TRAINED TO SCAN BUILDINGS AS PART OF THEIR GENERAL OBSERVATION OF THE CROWD OF SPECTATORS
LJ048-0188 THESE SUBSTITUTE MEASURES WERE OF LIMITED VALUE. AGENT LAWSON WAS UNABLE TO STATE WHETHER HE HAD ACTUALLY INSTRUCTED
LJ048-0189 THE DALLAS POLICE TO SCAN WINDOWS OF BUILDINGS LINING THE MOTORCADE ROUTE ALTHOUGH IT WAS HIS USUAL PRACTICE TO DO SO
LJ048-0190 IF SUCH INSTRUCTIONS WERE IN FACT GIVEN THEY WERE NOT EFFECTIVELY CARRIED OUT
LJ048-0191 TELEVISION FILMS TAKEN OF PARTS OF THE MOTORCADE BY A DALLAS TELEVISION STATION
LJ048-0192 SHOW THE FOOT PATROLMEN FACING THE PASSING MOTORCADE AND NOT THE ADJACENT CROWDS AND BUILDINGS AS THE PROCESSION PASSED
LJ048-0193 THREE OFFICERS FROM THE DALLAS POLICE DEPARTMENT WERE ASSIGNED TO THE INTERSECTION OF ELM AND HOUSTON
LJ048-0194 DURING THE MORNING OF NOVEMBER 22 PRIOR TO THE MOTORCADE
LJ048-0195 ALL RECEIVED THEIR INSTRUCTIONS EARLY IN THE MORNING FROM CAPT. P. W. LAWRENCE OF THE TRAFFIC DIVISION
LJ048-0196 ACCORDING TO CAPTAIN LAWRENCE QUOTE
LJ048-0197 I THEN TOLD THE OFFICERS THAT THEIR PRIMARY DUTY WAS TRAFFIC AND CROWD CONTROL AND THAT THEY SHOULD BE ALERT FOR ANY PERSONS WHO MIGHT ATTEMPT TO THROW ANYTHING
LJ048-0198 AND ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOT A VIOLATION OF THE LAW TO CARRY A PLACARD THAT THEY WERE NOT TO TOLERATE ANY ACTIONS SUCH AS THE STEVENSON INCIDENT
LJ048-0199 AND ARREST ANY PERSON WHO MIGHT ATTEMPT TO THROW ANYTHING OR TRY TO GET AT THE PRESIDENT AND HIS PARTY
LJ048-0200 PAYING PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE CROWD FOR ANY UNUSUAL ACTIVITY
LJ048-0201 I STRESSED THE FACT THAT THIS WAS OUR PRESIDENT AND HE SHOULD BE SHOWN EVERY RESPECT DUE HIS POSITION AND THAT IT WAS OUR DUTY TO SEE THAT THIS WAS DONE
LJ048-0202 END QUOTE. CAPTAIN LAWRENCE WAS NOT INSTRUCTED TO HAVE HIS MEN WATCH BUILDINGS ALONG THE MOTORCADE ROUTE AND DID NOT MENTION THE OBSERVATION OF BUILDINGS TO THEM
LJ048-0203 THE THREE OFFICERS CONFIRM THAT THEIR PRIMARY CONCERN WAS CROWD AND TRAFFIC CONTROL
LJ048-0204 AND THAT THEY HAD NO OPPORTUNITY TO SCAN THE WINDOWS OF THE DEPOSITORY OR ANY OTHER BUILDING IN THE VICINITY OF ELM AND HOUSTON WHEN THE MOTORCADE WAS PASSING
LJ048-0205 THEY HAD HOWEVER OCCASIONALLY OBSERVED THE WINDOWS OF BUILDINGS IN THE AREA BEFORE THE MOTORCADE ARRIVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR OWN UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR FUNCTION
LJ048-0206 AS THE MOTORCADE APPROACHED ELM STREET
LJ048-0207 THERE WERE SEVERAL SECRET SERVICE AGENTS IN IT WHO SHARED THE RESPONSIBILITY OF SCANNING THE WINDOWS OF NEARBY BUILDINGS
LJ048-0208 AGENT SORRELS RIDING IN THE LEAD CAR DID OBSERVE THE TEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY BUILDING AS HE PASSED BY
LJ048-0209 AT LEAST FOR A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF SECONDS TO GAIN A QUOTE GENERAL IMPRESSION END QUOTE OF THE LACK OF ANY UNUSUAL ACTIVITY
LJ048-0210 HE WAS HANDICAPPED HOWEVER BY THE FACT THAT HE WAS RIDING IN A CLOSED CAR WHOSE ROOF AT TIMES OBSCURED HIS VIEW
LJ048-0211 LAWSON ALSO IN THE LEAD CAR DID NOT SCAN ANY BUILDINGS SINCE AN IMPORTANT PART OF HIS JOB WAS TO LOOK BACKWARD AT THE PRESIDENT'S CAR
LJ048-0212 LAWSON STATED THAT HE QUOTE WAS LOOKING BACK A GOOD DEAL OF THE TIME
LJ048-0213 WATCHING HIS CAR WATCHING THE SIDES WATCHING THE CROWDS GIVING ADVICE OR ASKING ADVICE FROM THE CHIEF
LJ048-0214 AND ALSO LOOKING AHEAD TO THE KNOWN HAZARDS LIKE OVERPASSES UNDERPASSES RAILROADS ET CETERA END QUOTE
LJ048-0215 AGENT ROY H. KELLERMAN RIDING IN THE FRONT SEAT OF THE PRESIDENTIAL CAR
LJ048-0216 STATED THAT HE SCANNED THE DEPOSITORY BUILDING BUT NOT SUFFICIENTLY TO BE ALERTED BY ANYTHING IN THE WINDOWS OR ON THE ROOF
LJ048-0217 THE AGENTS IN THE FOLLOWUP CAR ALSO WERE EXPECTED TO SCAN ADJACENT BUILDINGS
LJ048-0218 HOWEVER THE COMMISSION DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT AGENTS STATIONED IN A CAR BEHIND THE PRESIDENTIAL CAR
LJ048-0219 WHO MUST CONCENTRATE PRIMARILY ON THE POSSIBILITY OF THREATS FROM CROWDS ALONG THE ROUTE PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT SAFEGUARD AGAINST DANGERS IN NEARBY BUILDINGS
LJ048-0220 CONDUCT OF SECRET SERVICE AGENTS IN FORT WORTH ON NOVEMBER 22
LJ048-0221 IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS ON NOVEMBER 22 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ048-0222 IN FORT WORTH THERE OCCURRED A BREACH OF DISCIPLINE BY SOME MEMBERS OF THE SECRET SERVICE WHO WERE OFFICIALLY TRAVELING WITH THE PRESIDENT
LJ048-0223 AFTER THE PRESIDENT HAD RETIRED AT HIS HOTEL
LJ048-0224 NINE AGENTS WHO WERE OFF DUTY WENT TO THE NEARBY FORT WORTH PRESS CLUB AT MIDNIGHT OR SLIGHTLY THEREAFTER EXPECTING TO OBTAIN FOOD
LJ048-0225 THEY HAD LITTLE OPPORTUNITY TO EAT DURING THE DAY. NO FOOD WAS AVAILABLE AT THE PRESS CLUB
LJ048-0226 ALL OF THE AGENTS STAYED FOR A DRINK OF BEER OR IN SEVERAL CASES A MIXED DRINK
LJ048-0227 ACCORDING TO THEIR AFFIDAVITS THE DRINKING IN NO CASE AMOUNTED TO MORE THAN THREE GLASSES OF BEER OR ONE AND A HALF MIXED DRINKS
LJ048-0228 AND OTHERS WHO WERE PRESENT SAY THAT NO AGENT WAS INEBRIATED OR ACTED IMPROPERLY
LJ048-0229 THE STATEMENTS OF THE AGENTS INVOLVED ARE SUPPORTED BY STATEMENTS OF MEMBERS OF THE FORT WORTH PRESS WHO ACCOMPANIED OR OBSERVED THEM
LJ048-0230 AND BY A SECRET SERVICE INVESTIGATION
LJ048-0231 ACCORDING TO THEIR STATEMENTS THE AGENTS REMAINED AT THE PRESS CLUB FOR PERIODS VARYING FROM 30 MINUTES TO AN HOUR AND A HALF
LJ048-0232 AND THE LAST AGENT LEFT THE PRESS CLUB BY TWO A.M.
LJ048-0233 TWO OF THE NINE AGENTS RETURNED TO THEIR ROOMS THE SEVEN OTHERS PROCEEDED TO AN ESTABLISHMENT CALLED THE CELLAR COFFEE HOUSE
LJ048-0234 DESCRIBED BY SOME AS A BEATNIK PLACE AND BY ITS MANAGER AS QUOTE A UNIQUE SHOWPLACE WITH CONTINUOUS LIGHT ENTERTAINMENT ALL NIGHT
LJ048-0235 SERVING ONLY COFFEE FRUIT JUICES AND NO HARD LIQUORS OR BEER END QUOTE
LJ048-0236 THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT ANY OF THE AGENTS WHO VISITED THE CELLAR COFFEE HOUSE HAD ANY INTOXICATING DRINK AT THAT ESTABLISHMENT
LJ048-0237 MOST OF THE AGENTS WERE THERE FROM ABOUT ONE THIRTY OR ONE FORTY FIVE A.M. TO ABOUT 245 OR THREE A.M.
LJ048-0238 ONE AGENT WAS THERE FROM 2 UNTIL 5 A.M.
LJ048-0239 THE LOBBY OF THE HOTEL AND THE AREAS ADJACENT TO THE QUARTERS OF THE PRESIDENT WERE GUARDED DURING THE NIGHT
LJ048-0240 BY MEMBERS OF THE MIDNIGHT TO 8 A.M. SHIFT OF THE WHITE HOUSE DETAIL
LJ048-0241 THESE AGENTS WERE EACH RELIEVED FOR A HALF HOUR BREAK DURING THE NIGHT
LJ048-0242 THREE MEMBERS OF THIS SHIFT SEPARATELY TOOK THIS OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT THE CELLAR COFFEE HOUSE
LJ048-0243 ONLY ONE STAYED AS LONG AS A HALF HOUR AND NONE HAD ANY BEVERAGE THERE
LJ048-0244 CHIEF ROWLEY TESTIFIED THAT AGENTS ON DUTY IN SUCH A SITUATION USUALLY STAY WITHIN THE BUILDING DURING THEIR RELIEF
LJ048-0245 BUT THAT THEIR VISITS TO THE CELLAR WERE QUOTE NEITHER CONSISTENT NOR INCONSISTENT END QUOTE WITH THEIR DUTY
LJ048-0246 EACH OF THE AGENTS WHO VISITED THE PRESS CLUB OR THE CELLAR COFFEE HOUSE APART FROM THE THREE MEMBERS OF THE MIDNIGHT SHIFT
LJ048-0247 HAD DUTY ASSIGNMENTS BEGINNING NO LATER THAN 8 A.M. THAT MORNING
LJ048-0248 PRESIDENT KENNEDY WAS SCHEDULED TO SPEAK ACROSS THE STREET FROM HIS HOTEL IN FORT WORTH AT 830 A.M.
LJ048-0249 AND THEN AT A BREAKFAST AFTER WHICH THE ENTOURAGE WOULD PROCEED TO DALLAS
LJ048-0250 IN DALLAS ONE OF THE NINE AGENTS WAS ASSIGNED TO ASSIST IN SECURITY MEASURES AT LOVE FIELD AND FOUR HAD PROTECTIVE ASSIGNMENTS AT THE TRADE MART
LJ048-0251 THE REMAINING FOUR HAD KEY RESPONSIBILITIES AS MEMBERS OF THE COMPLEMENT OF THE FOLLOWUP CAR IN THE MOTORCADE
LJ048-0252 THREE OF THESE AGENTS OCCUPIED POSITIONS ON THE RUNNING BOARDS OF THE CAR AND THE FOURTH WAS SEATED IN THE CAR
LJ048-0253 THE SUPERVISOR OF EACH OF THE OFFDUTY AGENTS WHO VISITED THE PRESS CLUB OR THE CELLAR COFFEE HOUSE
LJ048-0254 ADVISED IN THE COURSE OF THE SECRET SERVICE INVESTIGATION OF THESE EVENTS THAT EACH AGENT REPORTED FOR DUTY ON TIME
LJ048-0255 WITH FULL POSSESSION OF HIS MENTAL AND PHYSICAL CAPABILITIES AND ENTIRELY READY FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF HIS ASSIGNED DUTIES. CHIEF ROWLEY TESTIFIED THAT
LJ048-0256 AS A RESULT OF THE INVESTIGATION HE ORDERED HE WAS SATISFIED THAT EACH OF THE AGENTS PERFORMED HIS DUTIES IN AN ENTIRELY SATISFACTORY MANNER
LJ048-0257 AND THAT THEIR CONDUCT THE NIGHT BEFORE DID NOT IMPEDE THEIR ACTIONS ON DUTY
LJ048-0258 OR IN THE SLIGHTEST WAY PREVENT THEM FROM TAKING ANY ACTION THAT MIGHT HAVE AVERTED THE TRAGEDY
LJ048-0259 HOWEVER CHIEF ROWLEY DID NOT CONDONE THE ACTION OF THE OFFDUTY AGENTS PARTICULARLY SINCE IT VIOLATED A REGULATION OF THE SECRET SERVICE
LJ048-0260 WHICH PROVIDES QUOTE LIQUOR USE OF
LJ048-0261 A. EMPLOYEES ARE STRICTLY ENJOINED TO REFRAIN FROM THE USE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR
LJ048-0262 DURING THE HOURS THEY ARE OFFICIALLY EMPLOYED AT THEIR POST OF DUTY OR WHEN THEY MAY REASONABLY EXPECT THAT THEY MAY BE CALLED UPON TO PERFORM AN OFFICIAL DUTY
LJ048-0263 DURING ENTIRE PERIODS OF TRAVEL STATUS
LJ048-0264 THE SPECIAL AGENT IS OFFICIALLY EMPLOYED AND SHOULD NOT USE LIQUOR UNTIL THE COMPLETION OF ALL OF HIS OFFICIAL DUTIES FOR THE DAY
LJ048-0265 AFTER WHICH TIME A VERY MODERATE USE OF LIQUOR WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED A VIOLATION. HOWEVER ALL MEMBERS OF THE WHITE HOUSE DETAIL
LJ048-0266 AND SPECIAL AGENTS COOPERATING WITH THEM ON PRESIDENTIAL AND SIMILAR PROTECTIVE ASSIGNMENTS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE SUBJECT TO CALL FOR OFFICIAL DUTY
LJ048-0267 AT ANY TIME WHILE IN TRAVEL STATUS
LJ048-0268 THEREFORE THE USE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR OF ANY KIND INCLUDING BEER AND WINE BY MEMBERS OF THE WHITE HOUSE DETAIL
LJ048-0269 AND SPECIAL AGENTS COOPERATING WITH THEM OR BY SPECIAL AGENTS ON SIMILAR ASSIGNMENTS WHILE THEY ARE IN A TRAVEL STATUS IS PROHIBITED. END QUOTE
LJ048-0270 THE REGULATIONS PROVIDE FURTHER THAT QUOTE VIOLATION OR SLIGHT DISREGARD END QUOTE OF THESE PROVISIONS QUOTE
LJ048-0271 WILL BE CAUSE FOR REMOVAL FROM THE SERVICE END QUOTE
LJ048-0272 CHIEF ROWLEY TESTIFIED
LJ048-0273 THAT UNDER ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN DISCIPLINARY ACTION AGAINST THOSE AGENTS WHO HAD BEEN DRINKING IN CLEAR VIOLATION OF THE REGULATION
LJ048-0274 HOWEVER HE FELT THAT ANY DISCIPLINARY ACTION MIGHT HAVE GIVEN RISE
LJ048-0275 TO AN INFERENCE THAT THE VIOLATION OF THE REGULATION HAD CONTRIBUTED TO THE TRAGIC EVENTS OF NOVEMBER 22
LJ048-0276 SINCE HE WAS CONVINCED THAT THIS WAS NOT THE CASE HE BELIEVED THAT IT WOULD BE UNFAIR TO THE AGENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO TAKE EXPLICIT DISCIPLINARY MEASURES
LJ048-0277 HE FELT THAT EACH AGENT RECOGNIZED THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE INFRACTION AND THAT THERE WAS NO DANGER OF A REPETITION
LJ048-0278 THE COMMISSION RECOGNIZES THAT THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF MEMBERS OF THE WHITE HOUSE DETAIL OF THE SECRET SERVICE ARE ARDUOUS
LJ048-0279 THEY WORK LONG HARD HOURS UNDER VERY GREAT STRAIN AND MUST TRAVEL FREQUENTLY
LJ048-0280 IT MIGHT SEEM HARSH TO CIRCUMSCRIBE THEIR OPPORTUNITIES FOR RELAXATION
LJ048-0281 YET THEIR ROLE OF PROTECTING THE PRESIDENT IS SO IMPORTANT TO THE WELLBEING OF THE COUNTRY
LJ048-0282 THAT IT IS REASONABLE TO EXPECT THEM TO MEET VERY HIGH STANDARDS OF PERSONAL CONDUCT
LJ048-0283 SO THAT NOTHING CAN INTERFERE WITH THEIR BRINGING TO THEIR TASK THE FINEST QUALITIES AND MAXIMUM RESOURCES OF MIND AND BODY
LJ048-0284 THIS IS THE SALUTARY GOAL TO WHICH THE SECRET SERVICE REGULATION IS DIRECTED
LJ048-0285 WHEN IT ABSOLUTELY FORBIDS DRINKING BY ANY AGENT ACCOMPANYING THE PRESIDENT ON A TRIP
LJ048-0286 NOR IS THIS GOAL SERVED WHEN AGENTS REMAIN OUT UNTIL EARLY MORNING HOURS AND LOSE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF SLEEP
LJ048-0287 IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT THOSE MEN WHO HAD LITTLE SLEEP AND WHO HAD CONSUMED ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES EVEN IN LIMITED QUANTITIES
LJ048-0288 MIGHT HAVE BEEN MORE ALERT IN THE DALLAS MOTORCADE IF THEY HAD RETIRED PROMPTLY IN FORT WORTH
LJ048-0289 HOWEVER THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THESE MEN FAILED TO TAKE ANY ACTION IN DALLAS WITHIN THEIR POWER THAT WOULD HAVE AVERTED THE TRAGEDY
LJ049-0001 REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION ON THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY
LJ049-0002 THE WARREN COMMISSION REPORT BY THE PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION ON THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY
LJ049-0003 CHAPTER EIGHT THE PROTECTION OF THE PRESIDENT PART FOUR
LJ049-0004 THE MOTORCADE IN DALLAS
LJ049-0005 RIGOROUS SECURITY PRECAUTIONS HAD BEEN ARRANGED AT LOVE FIELD WITH THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES BY AGENTS SORRELS AND LAWSON
LJ049-0006 THESE PRECAUTIONS INCLUDED RESERVING A CEREMONIAL AREA FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL PARTY
LJ049-0007 STATIONING POLICE ON THE ROOFTOPS OF ALL BUILDINGS OVERLOOKING THE RECEPTION AREA
LJ049-0008 AND DETAILING POLICE IN CIVILIAN CLOTHES TO BE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE SIZABLE CROWD
LJ049-0009 WHEN PRESIDENT AND MRS. KENNEDY SHOOK HANDS WITH MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ALONG THE FENCES SURROUNDING THE RECEPTION AREA THEY WERE CLOSELY GUARDED BY SECRET SERVICE AGENTS
LJ049-0010 WHO RESPONDED TO THE UNPLANNED EVENT WITH DISPATCH
LJ049-0011 AS DESCRIBED IN CHAPTER 2 THE PRESIDENT DIRECTED THAT HIS CAR STOP ON TWO OCCASIONS DURING THE MOTORCADE SO THAT HE COULD GREET MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC
LJ049-0012 AT THESE STOPS AGENTS FROM THE PRESIDENTIAL FOLLOWUP CAR STOOD BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND THE PUBLIC
LJ049-0013 AND ON ONE OCCASION AGENT KELLERMAN LEFT THE FRONT SEAT OF THE PRESIDENT'S CAR TO TAKE A SIMILAR POSITION
LJ049-0014 THE COMMISSION REGARDS SUCH IMPROMPTU STOPS AS PRESENTING AN UNNECESSARY DANGER
LJ049-0015 BUT FINDS THAT THE SECRET SERVICE AGENTS DID ALL THAT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE TO TAKE PROTECTIVE MEASURES
LJ049-0016 THE PRESIDENTIAL LIMOUSINE
LJ049-0017 THE LIMOUSINE USED BY PRESIDENT KENNEDY IN DALLAS WAS A CONVERTIBLE WITH A DETACHABLE RIGID PLASTIC BUBBLE TOP
LJ049-0018 WHICH WAS NEITHER BULLETPROOF NOR BULLET RESISTANT
LJ049-0019 THE LAST PRESIDENTIAL VEHICLE WITH ANY PROTECTION AGAINST SMALLARMS FIRE LEFT THE WHITE HOUSE IN NINETEEN FIFTY THREE
LJ049-0020 IT WAS NOT THEN REPLACED BECAUSE THE STATE OF THE ART DID NOT PERMIT THE DEVELOPMENT OF A BULLETPROOF TOP OF SUFFICIENTLY LIGHT WEIGHT
LJ049-0021 TO PERMIT ITS REMOVAL ON THOSE OCCASIONS WHEN THE PRESIDENT WISHED TO RIDE IN AN OPEN CAR
LJ049-0022 THE SECRET SERVICE BELIEVED THAT IT WAS VERY DOUBTFUL THAT ANY PRESIDENT WOULD RIDE REGULARLY IN A VEHICLE WITH A FIXED TOP EVEN THOUGH TRANSPARENT
LJ049-0023 SINCE THE ASSASSINATION THE SECRET SERVICE WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES AND OF PRIVATE INDUSTRY
LJ049-0024 HAS DEVELOPED A VEHICLE FOR THE BETTER PROTECTION OF THE PRESIDENT
LJ049-0025 ACCESS TO PASSENGER COMPARTMENT OF PRESIDENTIAL CAR
LJ049-0026 ON OCCASION THE SECRET SERVICE HAS BEEN PERMITTED TO HAVE AN AGENT RIDING IN THE PASSENGER COMPARTMENT WITH THE PRESIDENT
LJ049-0027 PRESIDENTS HAVE MADE IT CLEAR HOWEVER THAT THEY DID NOT FAVOR THIS OR ANY OTHER ARRANGEMENT WHICH INTERFERES WITH THE PRIVACY OF THE PRESIDENT AND HIS GUESTS
LJ049-0028 THE SECRET SERVICE HAS THEREFORE SUGGESTED THIS PRACTICE ONLY ON EXTRAORDINARY OCCASIONS
LJ049-0029 WITHOUT ATTEMPTING TO PRESCRIBE OR RECOMMEND SPECIFIC MEASURES WHICH SHOULD BE EMPLOYED FOR THE FUTURE PROTECTION OF PRESIDENTS
LJ049-0030 THE COMMISSION DOES BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE ASPECTS OF THE PROTECTIVE MEASURES EMPLOYED IN THE MOTORCADE AT DALLAS WHICH DESERVE SPECIAL COMMENT
LJ049-0031 THE PRESIDENTIAL VEHICLE IN USE IN DALLAS DESCRIBED IN CHAPTER TWO
LJ049-0032 HAD NO SPECIAL DESIGN OR EQUIPMENT WHICH WOULD HAVE PERMITTED THE SECRET SERVICE AGENT RIDING IN THE DRIVER'S COMPARTMENT
LJ049-0033 TO MOVE INTO THE PASSENGER SECTION WITHOUT HINDRANCE OR DELAY HAD THE VEHICLE BEEN SO DESIGNED IT IS POSSIBLE THAT AN AGENT RIDING IN THE FRONT SEAT
LJ049-0034 COULD HAVE REACHED THE PRESIDENT IN TIME TO PROTECT HIM FROM THE SECOND AND FATAL SHOT TO HIT THE PRESIDENT
LJ049-0035 HOWEVER SUCH ACCESS TO THE PRESIDENT WAS INTERFERED WITH BOTH BY THE METAL BAR SOME FIFTEEN INCHES ABOVE THE BACK OF THE FRONT SEAT
LJ049-0036 AND BY THE PASSENGERS IN THE JUMP SEATS
LJ049-0037 IN CONTRAST THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL VEHICLE ALTHOUGH NOT SPECIALLY DESIGNED FOR THAT PURPOSE
LJ049-0038 HAD NO PASSENGER IN A JUMP SEAT BETWEEN AGENT YOUNGBLOOD AND VICE PRESIDENT JOHNSON TO INTERFERE WITH AGENT YOUNGBLOOD'S ABILITY
LJ049-0039 TO TAKE A PROTECTIVE POSITION IN THE PASSENGER COMPARTMENT BEFORE THE THIRD SHOT WAS FIRED
LJ049-0040 THE ASSASSINATION SUGGESTS THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OF PRIME IMPORTANCE
LJ049-0041 IN THE PROTECTION OF THE PRESIDENT IF THE PRESIDENTIAL CAR PERMITTED IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO THE PRESIDENT BY A SECRET SERVICE AGENT AT THE FIRST SIGN OF DANGER
LJ049-0042 AT THAT TIME THE AGENTS ON THE FRAMING BOARDS OF THE FOLLOWUP CAR WERE EXPECTED TO PERFORM SUCH A FUNCTION
LJ049-0043 HOWEVER THESE AGENTS COULD NOT REACH THE PRESIDENT'S CAR WHEN IT WAS TRAVELING AT AN APPRECIABLE RATE OF SPEED
LJ049-0044 EVEN IF THE CAR IS TRAVELING MORE SLOWLY THE DELAY INVOLVED IN REACHING THE PRESIDENT MAY BE CRUCIAL
LJ049-0045 IT IS CLEAR THAT AT THE TIME OF THE SHOTS IN DALLAS AGENT CLINTON J. HILL LEAPED TO THE PRESIDENT'S RESCUE AS QUICKLY AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE
LJ049-0046 EVEN SO ANALYSIS OF THE MOTION PICTURE FILMS TAKEN BY AMATEUR PHOTOGRAPHER ZAPRUDER
LJ049-0047 REVEALS THAT HILL FIRST PLACED HIS HAND ON THE PRESIDENTIAL CAR AT FRAME 343 30 FRAMES
LJ049-0048 AND THEREFORE APPROXIMATELY 1.6 SECONDS AFTER THE PRESIDENT WAS SHOT IN THE HEAD
LJ049-0049 ABOUT 3.7 SECONDS AFTER THE PRESIDENT RECEIVED THIS WOUND
LJ049-0050 HILL HAD BOTH FEET ON THE CAR AND WAS CLIMBING ABOARD TO ASSIST PRESIDENT AND MRS. KENNEDY
LJ049-0051 PLANNING FOR MOTORCADE CONTINGENCIES
LJ049-0052 IN RESPONSE TO INQUIRY BY THE COMMISSION REGARDING THE INSTRUCTIONS TO AGENTS IN A MOTORCADE
LJ049-0053 OF EMERGENCY PROCEDURES TO BE TAKEN IN A CONTINGENCY SUCH AS THAT WHICH ACTUALLY OCCURRED THE SECRET SERVICE RESPONDED QUOTE
LJ049-0054 THE SECRET SERVICE HAS CONSISTENTLY FOLLOWED TWO GENERAL PRINCIPLES IN EMERGENCIES INVOLVING THE PRESIDENT
LJ049-0055 ALL AGENTS ARE SO INSTRUCTED
LJ049-0056 THE FIRST DUTY OF THE AGENTS IN THE MOTORCADE IS TO ATTEMPT TO COVER THE PRESIDENT AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE AND PRACTICABLE
LJ049-0057 AND TO SHIELD HIM BY ATTEMPTING TO PLACE THEMSELVES BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND ANY SOURCE OF DANGER
LJ049-0058 SECONDLY AGENTS ARE INSTRUCTED TO REMOVE THE PRESIDENT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE FROM KNOWN OR IMPENDING DANGER
LJ049-0059 AGENTS ARE INSTRUCTED THAT IT IS NOT THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO INVESTIGATE OR EVALUATE A PRESENT DANGER
LJ049-0060 BUT TO CONSIDER ANY UNTOWARD CIRCUMSTANCES AS SERIOUS AND TO AFFORD THE PRESIDENT MAXIMUM PROTECTION AT ALL TIMES
LJ049-0061 NO RESPONSIBILITY RESTS UPON THOSE AGENTS NEAR THE PRESIDENT FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OR ARREST OF ANY ASSASSIN OR AN ATTACKER
LJ049-0062 THEIR PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY IS TO STAY WITH AND PROTECT THE PRESIDENT
LJ049-0063 BEYOND THESE TWO PRINCIPLES THE SECRET SERVICE BELIEVES A DETAILED CONTINGENCY OR EMERGENCY PLAN IS NOT FEASIBLE
LJ049-0064 BECAUSE THE VARIATIONS POSSIBLE PRECLUDE EFFECTIVE PLANNING
LJ049-0065 A NUMBER OF STEPS ARE TAKEN HOWEVER TO PERMIT APPROPRIATE STEPS TO BE TAKEN IN AN EMERGENCY
LJ049-0066 FOR INSTANCE THE LEAD CAR ALWAYS IS MANNED BY SECRET SERVICE AGENTS FAMILIAR WITH THE AREA AND WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS
LJ049-0067 THE RADIO NET IN USE IN MOTORCADES IS ELABORATE AND PERMITS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT MEANS OF COMMUNICATION WITH VARIOUS LOCAL POINTS
LJ049-0068 A DOCTOR IS IN THE MOTORCADE
LJ049-0069 THIS BASIC APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM OF PLANNING FOR EMERGENCIES IS SOUND
LJ049-0070 ANY EFFORT TO PREPARE DETAILED CONTINGENCY PLANS MIGHT WELL HAVE THE UNDESIRABLE EFFECT OF INHIBITING QUICK AND IMAGINATIVE RESPONSES
LJ049-0071 IF THE ADVANCE PREPARATION IS THOROUGH AND THE PROTECTIVE DEVICES AND TECHNIQUES EMPLOYED ARE SOUND
LJ049-0072 THOSE IN COMMAND SHOULD BE ABLE TO DIRECT THE RESPONSE APPROPRIATE TO THE EMERGENCY. THE COMMISSION FINDS THAT THE SECRET SERVICE AGENTS IN THE MOTORCADE
LJ049-0073 WHO WERE IMMEDIATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PRESIDENT'S SAFETY REACTED PROMPTLY AT THE TIME THE SHOTS WERE FIRED
LJ049-0074 THEIR ACTIONS DEMONSTRATE THAT THE PRESIDENT AND THE NATION CAN EXPECT COURAGE AND DEVOTION TO DUTY FROM THE AGENTS OF THE SECRET SERVICE
LJ049-0075 RECOMMENDATIONS
LJ049-0076 THE COMMISSION'S REVIEW OF THE PROVISIONS FOR PRESIDENTIAL PROTECTION AT THE TIME OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S TRIP TO DALLAS DEMONSTRATES THE NEED FOR SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENTS
LJ049-0077 SINCE THE ASSASSINATION THE SECRET SERVICE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY
LJ049-0078 HAVE PROPERLY TAKEN THE INITIATIVE IN REEXAMINING MAJOR ASPECTS OF PRESIDENTIAL PROTECTION
LJ049-0079 MANY CHANGES HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE AND OTHERS ARE CONTEMPLATED SOME OF THEM IN RESPONSE TO THE COMMISSION'S QUESTIONS AND INFORMAL SUGGESTIONS
LJ049-0080 ASSASSINATION A FEDERAL CRIME
LJ049-0081 THERE WAS NO FEDERAL CRIMINAL JURISDICTION OVER THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY
LJ049-0082 HAD THERE BEEN REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE ASSASSINATION WAS THE RESULT OF A CONSPIRACY FEDERAL JURISDICTION COULD HAVE BEEN ASSERTED
LJ049-0083 IT HAS LONG BEEN A FEDERAL CRIME TO CONSPIRE TO INJURE ANY FEDERAL OFFICER ON ACCOUNT OF OR WHILE HE IS ENGAGED IN THE LAWFUL DISCHARGE OF THE DUTIES OF HIS OFFICE
LJ049-0084 MURDER OF THE PRESIDENT HAS NEVER BEEN COVERED BY FEDERAL LAW HOWEVER SO THAT ONCE IT BECAME REASONABLY CLEAR THAT THE KILLING WAS THE ACT OF A SINGLE PERSON
LJ049-0085 THE STATE OF TEXAS HAD EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION
LJ049-0086 IT IS ANOMALOUS THAT CONGRESS HAS LEGISLATED IN OTHER WAYS TOUCHING UPON THE SAFETY OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OR OTHER FEDERAL OFFICERS
LJ049-0087 WITHOUT MAKING AN ATTACK ON THE PRESIDENT A CRIME. THREATENING HARM TO THE PRESIDENT IS A FEDERAL OFFENSE
LJ049-0088 AS IS ADVOCACY OF THE OVERTHROW OF THE GOVERNMENT BY THE ASSASSINATION OF ANY OF ITS OFFICERS
LJ049-0089 THE MURDER OF FEDERAL JUDGES U.S. ATTORNEYS AND MARSHALS AND A NUMBER OF OTHER SPECIFICALLY DESIGNATED
LJ049-0090 FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IS A FEDERAL CRIME
LJ049-0091 EQUALLY ANOMALOUS ARE STATUTORY PROVISIONS WHICH SPECIFICALLY AUTHORIZE THE SECRET SERVICE TO PROTECT THE PRESIDENT
LJ049-0092 WITHOUT AUTHORIZING IT TO ARREST ANYONE WHO HARMS HIM. THE SAME PROVISIONS AUTHORIZE THE SERVICE TO ARREST WITHOUT WARRANT
LJ049-0093 PERSONS COMMITTING CERTAIN OFFENSES INCLUDING COUNTERFEITING AND CERTAIN FRAUDS INVOLVING FEDERAL CHECKS OR SECURITIES
LJ049-0094 THE COMMISSION AGREES WITH THE SECRET SERVICE THAT IT SHOULD BE AUTHORIZED TO MAKE ARRESTS WITHOUT WARRANT
LJ049-0095 FOR ALL OFFENSES WITHIN ITS JURISDICTION AS ARE FBI AGENTS AND FEDERAL MARSHALS
LJ049-0096 THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF EFFORTS TO MAKE ASSASSINATION A FEDERAL CRIME PARTICULARLY AFTER THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT MCKINLEY
LJ049-0097 AND THE ATTEMPT ON THE LIFE OF PRESIDENTELECT FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT
LJ049-0098 IN 1902 BILLS PASSED BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS BUT FAILED OF ENACTMENT WHEN THE SENATE REFUSED TO ACCEPT THE CONFERENCE REPORT
LJ049-0099 A NUMBER OF BILLS WERE INTRODUCED IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY
LJ049-0100 THE COMMISSION RECOMMENDS TO THE CONGRESS THAT IT ADOPT LEGISLATION WHICH WOULD
LJ049-0101 PUNISH THE MURDER OR MANSLAUGHTER OF ATTEMPT OR CONSPIRACY TO MURDER KIDNAPING OF AND ASSAULT UPON
LJ049-0102 THE PRESIDENT VICE PRESIDENT OR OTHER OFFICER NEXT IN THE ORDER OF SUCCESSION TO THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT THE PRESIDENTELECT AND THE VICEPRESIDENTELECT
LJ049-0103 WHETHER OR NOT THE ACT IS COMMITTED WHILE THE VICTIM IS IN THE PERFORMANCE OF HIS OFFICIAL DUTIES OR ON ACCOUNT OF SUCH PERFORMANCE
LJ049-0104 SUCH A STATUTE WOULD COVER THE PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT OR IN THE ABSENCE OF A VICE PRESIDENT THE PERSON NEXT IN ORDER OF SUCCESSION
LJ049-0105 DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN ELECTION AND INAUGURATION THE PRESIDENTELECT AND VICEPRESIDENTELECT WOULD ALSO BE COVERED
LJ049-0106 RESTRICTING THE COVERAGE IN THIS WAY WOULD AVOID UNNECESSARY CONTROVERSY OVER THE INCLUSION OR EXCLUSION OF OTHER OFFICIALS WHO ARE IN THE ORDER OF SUCCESSION
LJ049-0107 OR WHO HOLD IMPORTANT GOVERNMENTAL POSTS
LJ049-0108 IN ADDITION THE RESTRICTION WOULD PROBABLY ELIMINATE A NEED FOR THE REQUIREMENT WHICH HAS BEEN URGED AS NECESSARY FOR THE EXERCISE OF FEDERAL POWER
LJ049-0109 THAT THE HOSTILE ACT OCCUR WHILE THE VICTIM IS ENGAGED IN OR BECAUSE OF THE PERFORMANCE OF OFFICIAL DUTIES
LJ049-0110 THE GOVERNMENTAL CONSEQUENCES OF ASSASSINATION OF ONE OF THE SPECIFIED OFFICIALS GIVE THE UNITED STATES AMPLE POWER TO ACT FOR ITS OWN PROTECTION
LJ049-0111 THE ACTIVITIES OF THE VICTIM AT THE TIME AN ASSASSINATION OCCURS AND THE MOTIVE FOR THE ASSASSINATION
LJ049-0112 BEAR NO RELATIONSHIP TO THE INJURY TO THE UNITED STATES WHICH FOLLOWS FROM THE ACT
LJ049-0113 THIS POINT WAS ABLY MADE IN THE 1902 DEBATE BY SENATOR GEORGE F. HOAR THE SPONSOR OF THE SENATE BILL QUOTE
LJ049-0114 WHAT THIS BILL MEANS TO PUNISH IS THE CRIME OF INTERRUPTION OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE DESTRUCTION OF ITS SECURITY BY STRIKING DOWN THE LIFE
LJ049-0115 OF THE PERSON WHO IS ACTUALLY IN THE EXERCISE OF THE EXECUTIVE POWER OR
LJ049-0116 OF SUCH PERSONS AS HAVE BEEN CONSTITUTIONALLY AND LAWFULLY PROVIDED TO SUCCEED THERETO IN CASE OF A VACANCY IT IS IMPORTANT TO THIS COUNTRY
LJ049-0117 THAT THE INTERRUPTION SHALL NOT TAKE PLACE FOR AN HOUR END QUOTE
LJ049-0118 ENACTMENT OF THIS STATUTE WOULD MEAN THAT THE INVESTIGATION OF ANY OF THE ACTS COVERED AND OF THE POSSIBILITY OF A FURTHER ATTEMPT
LJ049-0119 WOULD BE CONDUCTED BY FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS IN PARTICULAR THE FBI WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE SECRET SERVICE
LJ049-0120 AT PRESENT FEDERAL AGENCIES PARTICIPATE ONLY UPON THE SUFFERANCE OF THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES
LJ049-0121 WHILE THE POLICE WORK OF THE DALLAS AUTHORITIES IN THE EARLY IDENTIFICATION AND APPREHENSION OF OSWALD WAS BOTH EFFICIENT AND PROMPT
LJ049-0122 FBI DIRECTOR J. EDGAR HOOVER WHO STRONGLY SUPPORTS SUCH LEGISLATION TESTIFIED THAT THE ABSENCE OF CLEAR FEDERAL JURISDICTION
LJ049-0123 OVER THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY LED TO EMBARRASSMENT AND CONFUSION IN THE SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATION BY FEDERAL AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES
LJ049-0124 IN ADDITION THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION WILL INSURE
LJ049-0125 THAT ANY SUSPECTS WHO ARE ARRESTED WILL BE FEDERAL PRISONERS SUBJECT TO FEDERAL PROTECTION FROM VIGILANTE JUSTICE AND OTHER THREATS
LJ049-0126 COMMITTEE OF CABINET OFFICERS AS OUR GOVERNMENT HAS BECOME MORE COMPLEX
LJ049-0127 AGENCIES OTHER THAN THE SECRET SERVICE HAVE BECOME INVOLVED IN PHASES OF THE OVERALL PROBLEM OF PROTECTING OUR NATIONAL LEADERS
LJ049-0128 THE FBI IS THE MAJOR DOMESTIC INVESTIGATING AGENCY OF THE UNITED STATES
LJ049-0129 WHILE THE CIA HAS THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR COLLECTING INTELLIGENCE OVERSEAS TO SUPPLEMENT INFORMATION ACQUIRED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE
LJ049-0130 THE SECRET SERVICE MUST RELY IN LARGE PART
LJ049-0132 THE COMMISSION BELIEVES THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO IMPROVE THE COOPERATION AMONG THESE AGENCIES
LJ049-0133 AND TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE TASK OF PRESIDENTIAL PROTECTION IS ONE OF BROAD NATIONAL CONCERN
LJ049-0134 THE COMMISSION SUGGESTS THAT CONSIDERATION MIGHT BE GIVEN TO ASSIGNING TO A CABINETLEVEL COMMITTEE OR THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL
LJ049-0135 WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ADVISING THE PRESIDENT RESPECTING THE COORDINATION
LJ049-0136 OF DEPARTMENTAL POLICIES RELATING TO THE NATIONAL SECURITY THE RESPONSIBILITY TO REVIEW AND OVERSEE THE PROTECTIVE ACTIVITIES OF THE SECRET SERVICE
LJ049-0137 AND THE OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES THAT ASSIST IN SAFEGUARDING THE PRESIDENT. THE COMMITTEE SHOULD INCLUDE THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
LJ049-0138 AND IF THE COUNCIL IS USED ARRANGEMENTS SHOULD BE MADE FOR THE ATTENDANCE OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY
LJ049-0139 AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AT ANY MEETINGS WHICH ARE CONCERNED WITH PRESIDENTIAL PROTECTION
LJ049-0140 THE COUNCIL ALREADY INCLUDES IN ADDITION TO THE PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT THE SECRETARIES OF STATE AND DEFENSE AND HAS A COMPETENT STAFF
LJ049-0141 THE FOREMOST ASSIGNMENT OF THE COMMITTEE WOULD BE TO INSURE THAT THE MAXIMUM RESOURCES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE FULLY ENGAGED IN THE JOB OF PROTECTING THE PRESIDENT
LJ049-0142 BY DEFINING RESPONSIBILITIES CLEARLY AND OVERSEEING THEIR EXECUTION
LJ049-0143 MAJOR NEEDS OF PERSONNEL OR OTHER RESOURCES MIGHT BE MET MORE EASILY ON ITS RECOMMENDATION THAN THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST
LJ049-0144 THE COMMITTEE WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN DEFINING THE GENERAL NATURE OF DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN DANGERS TO PRESIDENTIAL SECURITY
LJ049-0145 AS IMPROVEMENTS ARE RECOMMENDED FOR THE ADVANCE DETECTION OF POTENTIAL THREATS TO THE PRESIDENT IT COULD ACT AS A FINAL REVIEW BOARD
LJ049-0146 THE EXPERT ASSISTANCE AND RESOURCES WHICH IT COULD DRAW UPON WOULD BE PARTICULARLY DESIRABLE IN THIS COMPLEX AND SENSITIVE AREA
LJ049-0147 THIS ARRANGEMENT WOULD PROVIDE A CONTINUING HIGHLEVEL CONTACT FOR AGENCIES THAT MAY WISH TO CONSULT RESPECTING PARTICULAR PROTECTIVE MEASURES
LJ049-0148 FOR VARIOUS REASONS THE SECRET SERVICE HAS FUNCTIONED LARGELY AS AN INFORMAL PART OF THE WHITE HOUSE STAFF WITH THE RESULT
LJ049-0149 THAT IT HAS BEEN UNABLE AS A PRACTICAL MATTER TO EXERCISE SUFFICIENT INFLUENCE OVER THE SECURITY PRECAUTIONS WHICH SURROUND PRESIDENTIAL ACTIVITIES
LJ049-0150 A CABINETLEVEL COMMITTEE WHICH IS ACTIVELY CONCERNED WITH THESE PROBLEMS WOULD BE ABLE TO DISCUSS THESE MATTERS MORE EFFECTIVELY WITH THE PRESIDENT
LJ049-0151 RESPONSIBILITIES FOR PRESIDENTIAL PROTECTION
LJ049-0152 THE ASSIGNMENT OF THE RESPONSIBILITY OF PROTECTING THE PRESIDENT TO AN AGENCY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY WAS LARGELY AN HISTORICAL ACCIDENT
LJ049-0153 THE SECRET SERVICE WAS ORGANIZED AS A DIVISION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE TO DEAL WITH COUNTERFEITING
LJ049-0154 IN EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR
LJ049-0155 WHILE INVESTIGATING A PLOT TO ASSASSINATE PRESIDENT CLEVELAND THE SERVICE ASSIGNED A SMALL PROTECTIVE DETAIL OF AGENTS TO THE WHITE HOUSE
LJ049-0156 SECRET SERVICE MEN ACCOMPANIED THE PRESIDENT AND HIS FAMILY TO THEIR VACATION HOME IN MASSACHUSETTS
LJ049-0157 AND SPECIAL DETAILS PROTECTED HIM IN WASHINGTON ON TRIPS AND AT SPECIAL FUNCTIONS
LJ049-0158 THESE INFORMAL AND PARTTIME ARRANGEMENTS LED TO MORE SYSTEMATIC PROTECTION IN 1902 AFTER THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT MCKINLEY
LJ049-0159 THE SECRET SERVICE THEN THE ONLY FEDERAL INVESTIGATIVE AGENCY ASSUMED FULLTIME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SAFETY OF THE PRESIDENT
LJ049-0160 SINCE THAT TIME THE SECRET SERVICE HAS HAD AND EXERCISED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PHYSICAL PROTECTION OF THE PRESIDENT
LJ049-0161 AND ALSO FOR THE PREVENTIVE INVESTIGATION OF POTENTIAL THREATS AGAINST THE PRESIDENT
LJ049-0162 ALTHOUGH THE SECRET SERVICE HAS HAD THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE PRESIDENT
LJ049-0163 THE FBI WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN 1908 HAS HAD IN RECENT YEARS AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY
LJ049-0164 IN THE APPROPRIATIONS OF THE FBI THERE HAS RECURRED ANNUALLY AN ITEM FOR THE QUOTE PROTECTION OF THE PERSON OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES END QUOTE
LJ049-0165 WHICH FIRST APPEARED IN THE APPROPRIATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN 1910 UNDER THE HEADING QUOTE MISCELLANEOUS OBJECTS END QUOTE
LJ049-0166 ALTHOUGH THE FBI IS NOT CHARGED WITH THE PHYSICAL PROTECTION OF THE PRESIDENT IT DOES HAVE AN ASSIGNMENT AS DO OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES
LJ049-0167 IN THE FIELD OF PREVENTIVE INVESTIGATION IN REGARD TO THE PRESIDENT'S SECURITY
LJ049-0168 AS DISCUSSED ABOVE THE BUREAU HAS ATTEMPTED TO MEET ITS RESPONSIBILITIES IN THIS FIELD BY SPELLING OUT IN ITS HANDBOOK
LJ049-0169 THE PROCEDURES WHICH ITS AGENTS ARE TO FOLLOW IN CONNECTION WITH INFORMATION RECEIVED QUOTE
LJ049-0170 INDICATING THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ATTEMPT AGAINST THE PERSON OR SAFETY OF THE PRESIDENT END QUOTE OR OTHER PROTECTED PERSONS
LJ049-0171 WITH TWO FEDERAL AGENCIES OPERATING IN THE SAME GENERAL FIELD OF PREVENTIVE INVESTIGATION
LJ049-0172 QUESTIONS INEVITABLY ARISE AS TO THE SCOPE OF EACH AGENCY'S AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY
LJ049-0173 AS THE TESTIMONY OF J. EDGAR HOOVER AND OTHER BUREAU OFFICIALS REVEALED THE FBI DID NOT BELIEVE THAT ITS DIRECTIVE REQUIRED THE BUREAU
LJ049-0174 TO NOTIFY THE SECRET SERVICE OF THE SUBSTANTIAL INFORMATION ABOUT LEE HARVEY OSWALD WHICH THE FBI HAD ACCUMULATED
LJ049-0175 BEFORE THE PRESIDENT REACHED DALLAS
LJ049-0176 ON THE OTHER HAND THE SECRET SERVICE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE WHATEVER OF OSWALD HIS BACKGROUND OR HIS EMPLOYMENT AT THE BOOK DEPOSITORY
LJ049-0177 AND ROBERT I. BOUCK WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF THE PROTECTIVE RESEARCH SECTION OF THE SECRET SERVICE BELIEVED THAT THE ACCUMULATION OF THE FACTS KNOWN TO THE FBI
LJ049-0178 SHOULD HAVE CONSTITUTED A SUFFICIENT BASIS TO WARN THE SECRET SERVICE OF THE OSWALD RISK
LJ049-0179 THE COMMISSION BELIEVES THAT BOTH THE FBI AND THE SECRET SERVICE HAVE TOO NARROWLY CONSTRUED THEIR RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES
LJ049-0180 THE COMMISSION HAS THE IMPRESSION
LJ049-0181 THAT TOO MUCH EMPHASIS IS PLACED BY BOTH ON THE INVESTIGATION OF SPECIFIC THREATS BY INDIVIDUALS AND NOT ENOUGH ON DANGERS FROM OTHER SOURCES
LJ049-0182 IN ADDITION THE COMMISSION HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE SECRET SERVICE PARTICULARLY TENDS TO BE THE PASSIVE RECIPIENT OF INFORMATION
LJ049-0183 REGARDING SUCH THREATS AND THAT ITS PROTECTIVE RESEARCH SECTION IS NOT ADEQUATELY STAFFED OR EQUIPPED
LJ049-0184 TO CONDUCT THE WIDER INVESTIGATIVE WORK THAT IS REQUIRED TODAY FOR THE SECURITY OF THE PRESIDENT
LJ049-0185 DURING THE PERIOD THE COMMISSION WAS GIVING THOUGHT TO THIS SITUATION
LJ049-0186 THE COMMISSION RECEIVED A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS DESIGNED TO IMPROVE CURRENT ARRANGEMENTS FOR PROTECTING THE PRESIDENT
LJ049-0187 THESE PROPOSALS INCLUDED SUGGESTIONS TO LOCATE EXCLUSIVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL PHASES OF THE WORK
LJ049-0188 IN ONE OR ANOTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCY TO CLARIFY THE DIVISION OF AUTHORITY BETWEEN THE AGENCIES INVOLVED AND TO RETAIN THE EXISTING SYSTEM
LJ049-0189 BUT EXPAND BOTH THE SCOPE AND THE OPERATIONS OF THE EXISTING AGENCIES PARTICULARLY THOSE OF THE SECRET SERVICE AND THE FBI
LJ049-0190 IT HAS BEEN POINTED OUT THAT THE FBI AS OUR CHIEF INVESTIGATIVE AGENCY
LJ049-0191 IS PROPERLY MANNED AND EQUIPPED TO CARRY ON EXTENSIVE INFORMATION GATHERING FUNCTIONS WITHIN THE UNITED STATES
LJ049-0192 IT WAS ALSO SUGGESTED THAT IT WOULD TAKE A SUBSTANTIAL PERIOD OF TIME FOR THE SECRET SERVICE TO BUILD UP THE EXPERIENCE AND SKILLS NECESSARY TO MEET THE PROBLEM
LJ049-0193 CONSEQUENTLY THE SUGGESTION HAS BEEN MADE ON THE ONE HAND THAT ALL PREVENTIVE INVESTIGATIVE FUNCTIONS RELATING TO THE SECURITY OF THE PRESIDENT
LJ049-0194 SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO THE FBI
LJ049-0195 LEAVING WITH THE SECRET SERVICE ONLY THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PHYSICAL PROTECTION OF THE PRESIDENT THAT IS THE GUARDING FUNCTION ALONE
LJ049-0196 ON THE OTHER HAND IT IS URGED THAT ALL FEATURES OF THE PROTECTION OF THE PRESIDENT AND HIS FAMILY SHOULD BE COMMITTED TO AN ELITE AND INDEPENDENT CORPS
LJ049-0197 IT IS ALSO CONTENDED THAT THE AGENTS SHOULD BE INTIMATELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE LIFE OF THE PRESIDENTIAL FAMILY
LJ049-0198 IN ALL ITS RAMIFICATIONS AND ALERT TO EVERY DANGER THAT MIGHT BEFALL IT
LJ049-0199 AND READY AT ANY INSTANT TO HAZARD GREAT DANGER TO THEMSELVES IN THE PERFORMANCE OF THEIR TREMENDOUS RESPONSIBILITY
LJ049-0200 IT IS SUGGESTED THAT AN ORGANIZATION SHORN OF ITS POWER TO INVESTIGATE ALL THE POSSIBILITIES OF DANGER TO THE PRESIDENT
LJ049-0201 AND BECOMING MERELY THE RECIPIENT OF INFORMATION GATHERED BY OTHERS WOULD BECOME LIMITED SOLELY TO ACTS OF PHYSICAL ALERTNESS AND PERSONAL COURAGE
LJ049-0202 INCIDENT TO ITS RESPONSIBILITIES
LJ049-0203 SO CIRCUMSCRIBED IT COULD NOT MAINTAIN THE ESPRIT DE CORPS OR THE NECESSARY ALERTNESS FOR THIS UNIQUE AND CHALLENGING RESPONSIBILITY
LJ049-0204 WHILE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS MANDATE
LJ049-0205 THIS COMMISSION HAS NECESSARILY EXAMINED INTO THE FUNCTIONING OF THE VARIOUS FEDERAL AGENCIES CONCERNED WITH THE TRAGIC TRIP OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY TO DALLAS
LJ049-0206 AND WHILE IT HAS ARRIVED AT CERTAIN CONCLUSIONS IN RESPECT THERETO IT SEEMS CLEAR
LJ049-0207 THAT IT WAS NOT WITHIN THE COMMISSION'S RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO THE LONGRANGE ORGANIZATION OF THE PRESIDENT'S PROTECTION
LJ049-0208 EXCEPT AS CONCLUSIONS FLOWING DIRECTLY FROM ITS EXAMINATION OF THE PRESIDENT'S ASSASSINATION CAN BE DRAWN
LJ049-0209 THE COMMISSION WAS NOT ASKED TO APPLY ITSELF AS DID THE HOOVER COMMISSION IN NINETEEN FORTY NINE
LJ049-0210 FOR EXAMPLES TO A DETERMINATION OF THE OPTIMUM ORGANIZATION OF THE PRESIDENT'S PROTECTION
LJ049-0211 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NECESSARY FOR THE COMMISSION TO TAKE CONSIDERABLE TESTIMONY MUCH OF IT EXTRANEOUS TO THE FACTS OF THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY
LJ049-0212 TO PUT IT IN A POSITION TO REACH FINAL CONCLUSIONS IN THIS RESPECT
LJ049-0213 THERE ARE ALWAYS DANGERS OF DIVIDED RESPONSIBILITY
LJ049-0214 DUPLICATION AND CONFUSION OF AUTHORITY WHERE MORE THAN ONE AGENCY IS OPERATING IN THE SAME FIELD BUT ON THE OTHER HAND
LJ049-0215 THE PROTECTION OF THE PRESIDENT IS IN A REAL SENSE A GOVERNMENTWIDE RESPONSIBILITY WHICH MUST NECESSARILY ASSUMED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE
LJ049-0216 THE FBI THE CIA AND THE MILITARY INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES AS WELL AS THE SECRET SERVICE
LJ049-0217 MOREOVER A NUMBER OF IMPONDERABLE QUESTIONS HAVE TO BE WEIGHED IF ANY CHANGE IN THE INTIMATE ASSOCIATION NOW ESTABLISHED
LJ049-0218 BETWEEN THE SECRET SERVICE AND THE PRESIDENT AND HIS FAMILY IS CONTEMPLATED
LJ049-0219 THESE CONSIDERATIONS HAVE INDUCED THE COMMISSION TO BELIEVE
LJ049-0220 THAT THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER OR NOT THERE SHOULD BE A RELOCATION OF RESPONSIBILITIES AND FUNCTIONS SHOULD BE LEFT TO THE EXECUTIVE AND THE CONGRESS
LJ049-0221 PERHAPS UPON RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON FURTHER STUDIES BY THE CABINETLEVEL COMMITTEE RECOMMENDED ABOVE OR THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL
LJ049-0222 PENDING ANY SUCH DETERMINATION HOWEVER THIS COMMISSION IS CONVINCED OF THE NECESSITY OF BETTER COORDINATION
LJ049-0223 AND DIRECTION OF THE ACTIVITIES OF ALL EXISTING AGENCIES OF GOVERNMENT WHICH ARE IN A POSITION TO AND DO FURNISH INFORMATION
LJ049-0224 AND SERVICES RELATED TO THE SECURITY OF THE PRESIDENT
LJ049-0225 THE COMMISSION FEELS THE SECRET SERVICE AND THE FBI AS WELL AS THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND THE CIA WHEN THE PRESIDENT TRAVELS ABROAD
LJ049-0226 COULD IMPROVE THEIR EXISTING CAPACITIES AND PROCEDURES SO AS TO LESSEN THE CHANCES OF ASSASSINATION
LJ049-0227 WITHOUT THEREFORE COMING TO FINAL CONCLUSIONS RESPECTING THE LONGRANGE ORGANIZATION OF THE PRESIDENT'S SECURITY
LJ049-0228 THE COMMISSION BELIEVES THAT THE FACTS OF THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY POINT TO CERTAIN MEASURES WHICH
LJ049-0229 WHILE ASSUMING NO RADICAL RELOCATION OF RESPONSIBILITIES
LJ049-0230 CAN AND SHOULD BE RECOMMENDED BY THIS COMMISSION IN THE INTEREST OF THE MORE EFFICIENT PROTECTION OF THE PRESIDENT
LJ050-0001 FOR MORE INFORMATION OR TO VOLUNTEER PLEASE VISIT LIBRIVOX DOT ORG. REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION ON THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY
LJ050-0002 THE WARREN COMMISSION REPORT
LJ050-0003 BY THE PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION ON THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY. CHAPTER 8. THE PROTECTION OF THE PRESIDENT. PART 5
LJ050-0004 GENERAL SUPERVISION OF THE SECRET SERVICE
LJ050-0005 THE INTIMACY OF THE SECRET SERVICE'S RELATIONSHIP TO THE WHITE HOUSE
LJ050-0006 AND THE DISSIMILARITY OF ITS PROTECTIVE FUNCTIONS TO MOST ACTIVITIES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY
LJ050-0007 HAVE MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR THE TREASURY TO MAINTAIN CLOSE AND CONTINUING SUPERVISION
LJ050-0008 THE COMMISSION BELIEVES THAT THE RECOMMENDED CABINETLEVEL COMMITTEE WILL HELP TO CORRECT MANY OF THE MAJOR DEFICIENCIES OF SUPERVISION
LJ050-0009 DISCLOSED BY THE COMMISSION'S INVESTIGATION. OTHER MEASURES SHOULD BE TAKEN AS WELL TO IMPROVE THE OVERALL OPERATION OF THE SECRET SERVICE
LJ050-0010 DAILY SUPERVISION OF THE OPERATIONS OF THE SECRET SERVICE WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY SHOULD BE IMPROVED
LJ050-0011 THE CHIEF OF THE SERVICE NOW REPORTS TO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY
LJ050-0012 THROUGH AN ASSISTANT SECRETARY WHOSE DUTIES ALSO INCLUDE THE DIRECT SUPERVISION OF THE BUREAU OF THE MINT
LJ050-0013 AND THE DEPARTMENT'S EMPLOYMENT POLICY PROGRAM AND WHO ALSO REPRESENTS THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY ON VARIOUS COMMITTEES AND GROUPS
LJ050-0014 THE INCUMBENT HAS NO TECHNICAL QUALIFICATIONS IN THE AREA OF PRESIDENTIAL PROTECTION
LJ050-0015 THE COMMISSION RECOMMENDS THAT THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY APPOINT A SPECIAL ASSISTANT WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF SUPERVISING THE SERVICE
LJ050-0016 THIS SPECIAL ASSISTANT SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO HAVE SUFFICIENT STATURE AND EXPERIENCE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT INTELLIGENCE OR ALLIED FIELDS
LJ050-0017 TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE CONTINUING SUPERVISION
LJ050-0018 AND TO KEEP THE SECRETARY FULLY INFORMED REGARDING ALL SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS RELATING TO PRESIDENTIAL PROTECTION
LJ050-0019 THIS REPORT HAS ALREADY POINTED OUT SEVERAL RESPECTS
LJ050-0020 IN WHICH THE COMMISSION BELIEVES THAT THE SECRET SERVICE HAS OPERATED WITH INSUFFICIENT PLANNING OR CONTROL
LJ050-0021 ACTIONS BY THE SERVICE SINCE THE ASSASSINATION INDICATE ITS AWARENESS OF THE NECESSITY FOR SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT IN ITS ADMINISTRATION
LJ050-0022 A FORMAL AND THOROUGH DESCRIPTION OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE ADVANCE AGENT IS NOW IN PREPARATION BY THE SERVICE
LJ050-0023 WORK IS GOING FORWARD
LJ050-0024 TOWARD THE PREPARATION OF FORMAL UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE RESPECTIVE ROLES OF THE SECRET SERVICE AND OTHER AGENCIES WITH WHICH IT COLLABORATES
LJ050-0025 OR FROM WHICH IT DERIVES ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT
LJ050-0026 THE COMMISSION URGES THAT THE SERVICE CONTINUE THIS EFFORT TO OVERHAUL AND DEFINE ITS PROCEDURES
LJ050-0027 WHILE MANUALS AND MEMORANDA ARE NO GUARANTEE OF EFFECTIVE OPERATIONS
LJ050-0028 NO SIZABLE ORGANIZATION CAN ACHIEVE EFFICIENCY WITHOUT THE CAREFUL ANALYSIS AND DEMARCATION OF RESPONSIBILITY
LJ050-0029 THAT IS REFLECTED IN DEFINITE AND COMPREHENSIVE OPERATING PROCEDURES
LJ050-0030 THE COMMISSION ALSO RECOMMENDS
LJ050-0031 THAT THE SECRET SERVICE CONSCIOUSLY SET ABOUT THE TASK OF INCULCATING AND MAINTAINING THE HIGHEST STANDARD OF EXCELLENCE AND ESPRIT FOR ALL OF ITS PERSONNEL
LJ050-0032 THIS INVOLVES TIGHT AND UNSWERVING DISCIPLINE AS WELL AS THE PROMOTION OF AN OUTSTANDING DEGREE OF DEDICATION AND LOYALTY TO DUTY
LJ050-0033 THE COMMISSION EMPHASIZES THAT IT FINDS NO CAUSAL CONNECTION BETWEEN THE ASSASSINATION
LJ050-0034 AND THE BREACH OF REGULATIONS WHICH OCCURRED ON THE NIGHT OF NOVEMBER TWENTY ONE AT FORT WORTH
LJ050-0035 NEVERTHELESS SUCH A BREACH IN WHICH SO MANY AGENTS PARTICIPATED
LJ050-0036 IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE STANDARDS WHICH THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE SECRET SERVICE REQUIRE IT TO MEET
LJ050-0037 PREVENTIVE INTELLIGENCE
LJ050-0038 IN ATTEMPTING TO IDENTIFY THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO MIGHT PROVE A DANGER TO THE PRESIDENT
LJ050-0039 THE SECRET SERVICE HAS LARGELY BEEN THE PASSIVE RECIPIENT OF THREATENING COMMUNICATIONS TO THE PRESIDENT
LJ050-0040 AND REPORTS FROM OTHER AGENCIES WHICH INDEPENDENTLY EVALUATE THEIR INFORMATION FOR POTENTIAL SOURCES OF DANGER
LJ050-0041 THIS WAS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE SERVICE'S LACK OF AN ADEQUATE INVESTIGATIVE STAFF
LJ050-0042 ITS INABILITY TO PROCESS LARGE AMOUNTS OF DATA AND ITS FAILURE TO PROVIDE SPECIFIC DESCRIPTIONS OF THE KIND OF INFORMATION IT SOUGHT
LJ050-0043 THE SECRET SERVICE HAS EMBARKED UPON A COMPLETE OVERHAUL OF ITS RESEARCH ACTIVITIES. THE STAFF OF THE PROTECTIVE RESEARCH SECTION PRS
LJ050-0044 HAS BEEN AUGMENTED AND A SECRET SERVICE INSPECTOR HAS BEEN PUT IN CHARGE OF THIS OPERATION. WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
LJ050-0045 AND OF THE ADVANCED RESEARCH PROJECTS AGENCY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
LJ050-0046 IT HAS OBTAINED THE SERVICES OF OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS SUCH AS THE RAND CORPORATION
LJ050-0047 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION AND A PANEL OF PSYCHIATRIC AND PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPERTS
LJ050-0048 IT HAS RECEIVED ASSISTANCE ALSO FROM DATA PROCESSING EXPERTS AT THE CIA
LJ050-0049 AND FROM A SPECIALIST IN PSYCHIATRIC PROGNOSTICATION AT WALTER REED HOSPITAL
LJ050-0050 AS A RESULT OF THESE STUDIES THE PLANNING DOCUMENT SUBMITTED BY THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY TO THE BUREAU OF THE BUDGET ON AUGUST THIRTY ONE
LJ050-0051 NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR MAKES SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT RECOMMENDATIONS IN THIS FIELD
LJ050-0052 BASED ON THE COMMISSION'S INVESTIGATION THE FOLLOWING MINIMUM GOALS FOR IMPROVEMENTS ARE INDICATED
LJ050-0053 BROADER AND MORE SELECTIVE CRITERIA
LJ050-0054 SINCE THE ASSASSINATION BOTH THE SECRET SERVICE AND THE FBI HAVE RECOGNIZED
LJ050-0055 THAT THE PRS FILES CAN NO LONGER BE LIMITED LARGELY TO PERSONS COMMUNICATING ACTUAL THREATS TO THE PRESIDENT
LJ050-0056 ON DECEMBER 26 NINETEEN SIXTY THREE THE FBI CIRCULATED ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS TO ALL ITS AGENTS
LJ050-0057 SPECIFYING CRITERIA FOR INFORMATION TO BE FURNISHED TO THE SECRET SERVICE IN ADDITION TO THAT COVERED BY THE FORMER STANDARD
LJ050-0058 WHICH WAS THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ATTEMPT AGAINST THE PERSON OR SAFETY OF THE PRESIDENT
LJ050-0059 HE NEW INSTRUCTIONS REQUIRE FBI AGENTS TO REPORT IMMEDIATELY INFORMATION CONCERNING QUOTE
LJ050-0060 SUBVERSIVES ULTRARIGHTISTS RACISTS AND FASCISTS A POSSESSING EMOTIONAL INSTABILITY OR IRRATIONAL BEHAVIOR
LJ050-0061 B WHO HAVE MADE THREATS OF BODILY HARM AGAINST OFFICIALS OR EMPLOYEES OF FEDERAL STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR OFFICIALS OF A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT
LJ050-0062 C WHO EXPRESS OR HAVE EXPRESSED STRONG OR VIOLENT ANTIU.S. SENTIMENTS
LJ050-0063 AND WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN BOMBING OR BOMBMAKING OR WHOSE PAST CONDUCT INDICATES TENDENCIES TOWARD VIOLENCE AND D
LJ050-0064 WHOSE PRIOR ACTS OR STATEMENTS DEPICT PROPENSITY FOR VIOLENCE AND HATRED AGAINST ORGANIZED GOVERNMENT END QUOTE
LJ050-0065 ALAN H. BELMONT ASSISTANT TO THE DIRECTOR OF THE FBI TESTIFIED THAT THIS REVISION WAS INITIATED BY THE FBI ITSELF
LJ050-0066 THE VOLUME OF REFERENCES TO THE SECRET SERVICE HAS INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY SINCE THE NEW INSTRUCTIONS WENT INTO EFFECT
LJ050-0067 MORE THAN 5000 NAMES WERE REFERRED TO THE SECRET SERVICE IN THE FIRST 4 MONTHS OF NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR
LJ050-0068 ACCORDING TO CHIEF ROWLEY BY MIDJUNE NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR
LJ050-0069 THE SECRET SERVICE HAD RECEIVED FROM THE FBI SOME 9000 REPORTS ON MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY
LJ050-0070 THE FBI NOW TRANSMITS INFORMATION ON ALL DEFECTORS A CATEGORY WHICH WOULD OF COURSE HAVE INCLUDED OSWALD
LJ050-0071 BOTH DIRECTOR HOOVER AND BELMONT EXPRESSED TO THE COMMISSION THE GREAT CONCERN OF THE FBI WHICH IS SHARED BY THE SECRET SERVICE
LJ050-0072 THAT REFERRALS TO THE SECRET SERVICE UNDER THE NEW CRITERIA MIGHT IF NOT PROPERLY HANDLED
LJ050-0073 RESULT IN SOME DEGREE OF INTERFERENCE WITH THE PERSONAL LIBERTY OF THOSE INVOLVED
LJ050-0074 THEY EMPHASIZED THE NECESSITY THAT THE INFORMATION NOW BEING FURNISHED BE HANDLED WITH JUDGMENT AND CARE
LJ050-0075 THE COMMISSION SHARES THIS CONCERN
LJ050-0076 THE PROBLEM IS AGGRAVATED BY THE NECESSITY THAT THE SERVICE OBTAIN THE ASSISTANCE OF LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS IN EVALUATING THE INFORMATION WHICH IT RECEIVES
LJ050-0077 AND IN TAKING PREVENTIVE STEPS
LJ050-0078 IN JUNE NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR THE SECRET SERVICE SENT TO A NUMBER OF FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES
LJ050-0079 GUIDELINES FOR AN EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM TO DEVELOP MORE DETAILED CRITERIA
LJ050-0080 THE SUGGESTIONS OF FEDERAL AGENCIES FOR REVISION OF THESE GUIDELINES WERE SOLICITED
LJ050-0081 THE NEW TENTATIVE CRITERIA ARE USEFUL IN MAKING CLEAR THAT
LJ050-0082 THE INTEREST OF THE SECRET SERVICE GOES BEYOND INFORMATION ON INDIVIDUALS OR GROUPS THREATENING TO CAUSE HARM OR EMBARRASSMENT TO THE PRESIDENT
LJ050-0083 INFORMATION IS REQUESTED ALSO CONCERNING INDIVIDUALS OR GROUPS WHO HAVE DEMONSTRATED AN INTEREST IN THE PRESIDENT
LJ050-0084 OR QUOTE OTHER HIGH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN THE NATURE OF A COMPLAINT COUPLED WITH AN EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED DETERMINATION TO USE A MEANS
LJ050-0085 OTHER THAN LEGAL OR PEACEFUL TO SATISFY ANY GRIEVANCE REAL OR IMAGINED
LJ050-0086 UNDER THESE CRITERIA WHETHER THE CASE SHOULD BE REFERRED TO THE SECRET SERVICE DEPENDS ON THE EXISTENCE OF A PREVIOUS HISTORY OF MENTAL INSTABILITY
LJ050-0087 PROPENSITY TOWARD VIOLENT ACTION OR SOME SIMILAR CHARACTERISTIC COUPLED WITH SOME EVALUATION OF THE CAPABILITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP
LJ050-0088 TO FURTHER THE INTENTION TO SATISFY A GRIEVANCE BY UNLAWFUL MEANS
LJ050-0089 WHILE THESE TENTATIVE CRITERIA ARE A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION
LJ050-0090 THEY SEEM UNDULY RESTRICTIVE IN CONTINUING TO REQUIRE SOME MANIFESTATION OF ANIMUS AGAINST A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL
LJ050-0091 IT IS QUESTIONABLE WHETHER SUCH CRITERIA WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN THE REFERRAL OF OSWALD TO THE SECRET SERVICE
LJ050-0092 CHIEF ROWLEY BELIEVED THAT THEY WOULD
LJ050-0093 BECAUSE OF OSWALD'S DEMONSTRATED HOSTILITY TOWARD THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY IN HIS LETTER OF JANUARY 30 NINETEEN SIXTY TWO. QUOTE
LJ050-0094 I SHALL EMPLOY ALL MEANS TO RIGHT THIS GROSS MISTAKE OR INJUSTICE TO A BONA FIDE U.S. CITIZEN AND EXSERVICE MAN
LJ050-0095 THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS NO CHARGES OR COMPLAINTS AGAINST ME
LJ050-0096 I ASK YOU TO LOOK INTO THIS CASE AND TAKE THE NECESSARY STEPS TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE DONE TO ME AND MY FAMILY END QUOTE
LJ050-0097 EVEN WITH THE ADVANTAGE OF HINDSIGHT THIS LETTER DOES NOT APPEAR TO EXPRESS OR IMPLY OSWALD'S QUOTE
LJ050-0098 DETERMINATION TO USE A MEANS OTHER THAN LEGAL OR PEACEFUL TO SATISFY HIS GRIEVANCE END QUOTE WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE NEW CRITERIA
LJ050-0099 IT IS APPARENT THAT A GOOD DEAL OF FURTHER CONSIDERATION AND EXPERIMENTATION WILL BE REQUIRED BEFORE ADEQUATE CRITERIA CAN BE FRAMED
LJ050-0100 THE COMMISSION RECOGNIZES THAT NO SET OF MEANINGFUL CRITERIA WILL YIELD THE NAMES OF ALL POTENTIAL ASSASSINS. CHARLES J. GUITEAU
LJ050-0101 LEON F. CZOLGOSZ
LJ050-0102 JOHN SCHRANK AND GUISEPPE ZANGARA  FOUR ASSASSINS OR WOULDBE ASSASSINS
LJ050-0103 WERE ALL MEN WHO ACTED ALONE IN THEIR CRIMINAL ACTS AGAINST OUR LEADERS. NONE HAD A SERIOUS RECORD OF PRIOR VIOLENCE
LJ050-0104 EACH OF THEM WAS A FAILURE IN HIS WORK AND IN HIS RELATIONS WITH OTHERS A VICTIM OF DELUSIONS AND FANCIES WHICH LED TO THE CONVICTION
LJ050-0105 THAT SOCIETY AND ITS LEADERS HAD COMBINED TO THWART HIM. IT WILL REQUIRE EVERY AVAILABLE RESOURCE OF OUR GOVERNMENT
LJ050-0106 TO DEVISE A PRACTICAL SYSTEM WHICH HAS ANY REASONABLE POSSIBILITY OF REVEALING SUCH MALCONTENTS
LJ050-0107 LIAISON WITH OTHER AGENCIES REGARDING INTELLIGENCE
LJ050-0108 THE SECRET SERVICE'S LIAISON WITH THE AGENCIES THAT SUPPLY INFORMATION TO IT HAS BEEN TOO CASUAL
LJ050-0109 SINCE THE ASSASSINATION THE SERVICE HAS RECOGNIZED THAT THESE RELATIONSHIPS MUST BE FAR MORE FORMAL
LJ050-0110 AND EACH AGENCY GIVEN CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ASSISTANCE WHICH THE SECRET SERVICE EXPECTS
LJ050-0111 ONCE THE SECRET SERVICE HAS FORMULATED ITS NEW STANDARDS FOR COLLECTION OF INFORMATION IT SHOULD ENTER INTO WRITTEN AGREEMENTS WITH EACH FEDERAL AGENCY
LJ050-0112 AND THE LEADING STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES THAT MIGHT BE A SOURCE OF SUCH INFORMATION
LJ050-0113 SUCH AGREEMENTS SHOULD DESCRIBE IN DETAIL THE INFORMATION WHICH IS SOUGHT THE MANNER IN WHICH IT WILL BE PROVIDED TO THE SECRET SERVICE
LJ050-0114 AND THE RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES FOR ANY FURTHER INVESTIGATION THAT MAY BE REQUIRED
LJ050-0115 THIS IS ESPECIALLY NECESSARY WITH REGARD TO THE FBI AND CIA
LJ050-0116 WHICH CARRY THE MAJOR RESPONSIBILITY FOR SUPPLYING INFORMATION ABOUT POTENTIAL THREATS
LJ050-0117 PARTICULARLY THOSE ARISING FROM ORGANIZED GROUPS WITHIN THEIR SPECIAL JURISDICTION
LJ050-0118 SINCE THESE AGENCIES ARE ALREADY OBLIGED CONSTANTLY TO EVALUATE THE ACTIVITIES OF SUCH GROUPS
LJ050-0119 THEY SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ADVISING THE SECRET SERVICE IF INFORMATION DEVELOPS INDICATING THE EXISTENCE OF AN ASSASSINATION PLOT
LJ050-0120 AND FOR REPORTING SUCH EVENTS AS A CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP OR DOGMA WHICH INDICATE THAT THE GROUP MAY PRESENT A DANGER TO THE PRESIDENT
LJ050-0121 DETAILED FORMAL AGREEMENTS EMBODYING THESE ARRANGEMENTS SHOULD BE WORKED OUT BETWEEN THE SECRET SERVICE AND BOTH OF THESE AGENCIES
LJ050-0122 IT SHOULD BE MADE CLEAR THAT THE SECRET SERVICE WILL IN NO WAY SEEK TO DUPLICATE THE INTELLIGENCE
LJ050-0123 AND INVESTIGATIVE CAPABILITIES OF THE AGENCIES NOW OPERATING IN THIS FIELD BUT WILL CONTINUE
LJ050-0124 TO USE THE DATA DEVELOPED BY THESE AGENCIES TO CARRY OUT ITS SPECIAL DUTIES
LJ050-0125 ONCE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN GAINED IN IMPLEMENTING SUCH AGREEMENTS WITH THE FEDERAL AND LEADING STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES
LJ050-0126 THE SECRET SERVICE THROUGH ITS FIELD OFFICES
LJ050-0127 SHOULD NEGOTIATE SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS WITH SUCH OTHER STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AS MAY PROVIDE MEANINGFUL ASSISTANCE
LJ050-0128 MUCH USEFUL INFORMATION WILL COME TO THE ATTENTION OF LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN THE REGULAR COURSE OF THEIR ACTIVITIES
LJ050-0129 AND THIS SOURCE SHOULD NOT BE NEGLECTED BY UNDUE CONCENTRATION ON RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES
LJ050-0130 FINALLY THESE AGREEMENTS WITH FEDERAL AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES WILL BE OF LITTLE VALUE
LJ050-0131 UNLESS A SYSTEM IS ESTABLISHED FOR THE FREQUENT FORMAL REVIEW OF ACTIVITIES THEREUNDER. IN THIS REGARD
LJ050-0132 THE COMMISSION NOTES WITH APPROVAL SEVERAL RECENT MEASURES TAKEN AND PROPOSED BY THE SECRET SERVICE TO IMPROVE ITS LIAISON ARRANGEMENTS
LJ050-0133 IN HIS TESTIMONY SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY C. DOUGLAS DILLON INFORMED THE COMMISSION
LJ050-0134 THAT AN INTERAGENCY COMMITTEE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED TO DEVELOP MORE EFFECTIVE CRITERIA
LJ050-0135 ACCORDING TO SECRETARY DILLON
LJ050-0136 THE COMMITTEE WILL INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE CIA
LJ050-0137 FBI AND THE SECRET SERVICE
LJ050-0138 IN ADDITION THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY HAS REQUESTED FIVE ADDITIONAL AGENTS FOR ITS PROTECTIVE RESEARCH SECTION
LJ050-0139 TO SERVE AS LIAISON OFFICERS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES. ON THE BASIS OF THE DEPARTMENT'S REVIEW DURING THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS
LJ050-0140 SECRETARY DILLON TESTIFIED THAT THE USE OF SUCH LIAISON OFFICERS IS THE ONLY EFFECTIVE WAY TO INSURE THAT ADEQUATE LIAISON IS MAINTAINED
LJ050-0141 AS A BEGINNING STEP TO IMPROVE LIAISON WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS THE SECRET SERVICE ON AUGUST 26 NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR
LJ050-0142 DIRECTED ITS FIELD REPRESENTATIVES TO SEND A FORM REQUEST FOR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION TO ALL LOCAL
LJ050-0143 COUNTY AND STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN THEIR DISTRICTS
LJ050-0144 EACH OF THESE EFFORTS APPEARS SOUND
LJ050-0145 AND THE COMMISSION RECOMMENDS THAT THESE AND THE OTHER MEASURES SUGGESTED BY THE COMMISSION BE PURSUED VIGOROUSLY BY SECRET SERVICE
LJ050-0146 AUTOMATIC DATA PROCESSING
LJ050-0147 UNLESS THE SECRET SERVICE IS ABLE TO DEAL RAPIDLY AND ACCURATELY WITH A GROWING BODY OF DATA
LJ050-0148 THE INCREASED INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY OTHER AGENCIES WILL BE WASTED
LJ050-0149 PRS MUST DEVELOP THE CAPACITY TO CLASSIFY ITS SUBJECTS ON A MORE SOPHISTICATED BASIS THAN THE PRESENT GEOGRAPHIC BREAKDOWN
LJ050-0150 ITS PRESENT MANUAL FILING SYSTEM IS OBSOLETE
LJ050-0151 IT MAKES NO USE OF THE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN AUTOMATIC DATA PROCESSING WHICH ARE WIDELY USED IN THE BUSINESS WORLD AND IN OTHER GOVERNMENT OFFICES
LJ050-0152 THE SECRET SERVICE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY NOW RECOGNIZE THIS CRITICAL NEED
LJ050-0153 IN THE PLANNING DOCUMENT CURRENTLY UNDER REVIEW BY THE BUREAU OF THE BUDGET THE DEPARTMENT RECOMMENDS THAT IT BE PERMITTED TO HIRE FIVE QUALIFIED PERSONS QUOTE
LJ050-0154 TO PLAN AND DEVELOP A WORKABLE AND EFFICIENT AUTOMATED FILE AND RETRIEVAL SYSTEM END QUOTE
LJ050-0155 ALSO THE DEPARTMENT REQUESTS THE SUM OF $100000 TO CONDUCT A DETAILED FEASIBILITY STUDY
LJ050-0156 THIS MONEY WOULD BE USED TO COMPENSATE CONSULTANTS TO LEASE STANDARD EQUIPMENT OR TO PURCHASE SPECIALLY DESIGNED PILOT EQUIPMENT
LJ050-0157 ON THE BASIS OF SUCH A FEASIBILITY STUDY
LJ050-0158 THE DEPARTMENT HOPES TO DESIGN A PRACTICAL SYSTEM WHICH WILL FULLY MEET THE NEEDS OF THE PROTECTIVE RESEARCH SECTION OF THE SECRET SERVICE
LJ050-0159 THE COMMISSION RECOMMENDS THAT PROMPT AND FAVORABLE CONSIDERATION BE GIVEN TO THIS REQUEST
LJ050-0160 THE COMMISSION FURTHER RECOMMENDS THAT THE SECRET SERVICE COORDINATE ITS PLANNING AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE WITH ALL OF THE FEDERAL AGENCIES FROM WHICH IT RECEIVES INFORMATION
LJ050-0161 THE SECRET SERVICE SHOULD NOT AND DOES NOT PLAN TO DEVELOP ITS OWN INTELLIGENCE GATHERING FACILITIES TO DUPLICATE THE EXISTING FACILITIES OF OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES
LJ050-0162 IN PLANNING ITS DATA PROCESSING TECHNIQUES
LJ050-0163 THE SECRET SERVICE SHOULD ATTEMPT TO DEVELOP A SYSTEM COMPATIBLE WITH THOSE OF THE AGENCIES FROM WHICH MOST OF ITS DATA WILL COME. NOTE
LJ050-0164 IN EVALUATING DATA PROCESSING TECHNIQUES OF THE SECRET SERVICE
LJ050-0165 THE COMMISSION HAD OCCASION TO BECOME INFORMED TO A LIMITED EXTENT ABOUT THE DATA PROCESSING TECHNIQUES OF OTHER FEDERAL INTELLIGENCE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES
LJ050-0166 THE COMMISSION WAS STRUCK BY THE APPARENT LACK OF EFFORT ON AN INTERAGENCY BASIS
LJ050-0167 TO DEVELOP COORDINATED AND MUTUALLY COMPATIBLE SYSTEMS EVEN WHERE SUCH COORDINATION WOULD NOT SEEM INCONSISTENT
LJ050-0168 WITH THE PARTICULAR PURPOSES OF THE AGENCY INVOLVED. THE COMMISSION RECOGNIZES THAT THIS IS A CONTROVERSIAL AREA
LJ050-0169 AND THAT MANY STRONGLY HELD VIEWS ARE ADVANCED IN RESISTANCE TO ANY SUGGESTION THAT AN EFFORT BE MADE TO IMPOSE ANY DEGREE OF COORDINATION
LJ050-0170 THIS MATTER IS OBVIOUSLY BEYOND THE JURISDICTION OF THE COMMISSION
LJ050-0171 BUT IT SEEMS TO WARRANT FURTHER STUDY BEFORE EACH AGENCY BECOMES IRREVOCABLY COMMITTED TO SEPARATE ACTION
LJ050-0172 THE COMMISSION THEREFORE RECOMMENDS THAT THE PRESIDENT CONSIDER ORDERING AN INQUIRY INTO THE POSSIBILITY
LJ050-0173 THAT COORDINATION MIGHT BE ACHIEVED TO A GREATER EXTENT THAN SEEMS NOW TO BE CONTEMPLATED WITHOUT INTERFERENCE WITH THE PRIMARY MISSION OF EACH AGENCY INVOLVED
LJ050-0174 PROTECTIVE RESEARCH PARTICIPATION IN ADVANCE ARRANGEMENTS
LJ050-0175 SINCE THE ASSASSINATION SECRET SERVICE PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN CHANGED TO REQUIRE THAT A MEMBER OF PRS ACCOMPANY EACH ADVANCE SURVEY TEAM
LJ050-0176 TO ESTABLISH LIAISON WITH LOCAL INTELLIGENCE GATHERING AGENCIES AND TO PROVIDE FOR THE IMMEDIATE EVALUATION OF INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM THEM
LJ050-0177 THIS PRS AGENT WILL ALSO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AN INFORMAL LOCAL LIAISON COMMITTEE
LJ050-0178 TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT ALL PROTECTIVE INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES ARE COORDINATED
LJ050-0179 BASED ON ITS EXPERIENCE DURING THIS PERIOD THE SECRET SERVICE NOW RECOMMENDS THAT ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO PRS
LJ050-0180 SO THAT THESE ARRANGEMENTS CAN BE MADE PERMANENT WITHOUT ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE OPERATIONS OF THE SERVICE'S FIELD OFFICES
LJ050-0181 THE COMMISSION REGARDS THIS AS A MOST USEFUL INNOVATION AND URGES THAT THE PRACTICE BE CONTINUED
LJ050-0182 LIAISON WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES
LJ050-0183 ADVICE BY THE SECRET SERVICE TO LOCAL POLICE IN METROPOLITAN AREAS RELATING TO THE ASSISTANCE EXPECTED IN CONNECTION WITH A PRESIDENTIAL VISIT
LJ050-0184 HAS HITHERTO BEEN HANDLED ON AN INFORMAL BASIS
LJ050-0185 THE SERVICE SHOULD CONSIDER PREPARING FORMAL EXPLANATIONS OF THE COOPERATION ANTICIPATED DURING A PRESIDENTIAL VISIT TO A CITY
LJ050-0186 IN FORMATS THAT CAN BE COMMUNICATED TO EACH LEVEL OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES
LJ050-0187 THUS THE LOCAL CHIEF OF POLICE COULD BE GIVEN A MASTER PLAN PREPARED FOR THE OCCASION OF ALL PROTECTIVE MEASURES TO BE TAKEN DURING THE VISIT
LJ050-0188 EACH PATROLMAN MIGHT BE GIVEN A PREPARED BOOKLET OF INSTRUCTIONS EXPLAINING WHAT IS EXPECTED OF HIM THE SECRET SERVICE HAS EXPRESSED CONCERN
LJ050-0189 THAT WRITTEN INSTRUCTIONS MIGHT COME INTO THE HANDS OF LOCAL NEWSPAPERS TO THE PREJUDICE OF THE PRECAUTIONS DESCRIBED
LJ050-0190 HOWEVER THE INSTRUCTIONS MUST BE COMMUNICATED TO THE LOCAL POLICE IN ANY EVENT AND CAN BE LEAKED TO THE PRESS WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE IN WRITING
LJ050-0191 MORE IMPORTANTLY THE LACK OF CAREFULLY PREPARED AND CAREFULLY TRANSMITTED INSTRUCTIONS FOR TYPICAL VISITS TO CITIES
LJ050-0192 CAN LEAD TO LAPSES IN PROTECTION SUCH AS THE CONFUSION IN DALLAS ABOUT WHETHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WERE PERMITTED ON OVERPASSES
LJ050-0193 SUCH INSTRUCTIONS WILL NOT FIT ALL CIRCUMSTANCES OF COURSE
LJ050-0194 AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE IMAGINATIVE APPLICATION OF JUDGMENT IN SPECIAL CASES
LJ050-0195 INSPECTION OF BUILDINGS
LJ050-0196 SINCE THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY THE SECRET SERVICE HAS BEEN EXPERIMENTING WITH NEW TECHNIQUES IN THE INSPECTION OF BUILDINGS ALONG A MOTORCADE ROUTE
LJ050-0197 ACCORDING TO SECRETARY DILLON
LJ050-0198 THE STUDIES INDICATE THAT THERE IS SOME UTILITY IN ATTEMPTING TO DESIGNATE CERTAIN BUILDINGS AS INVOLVING A HIGHER RISK THAN OTHERS
LJ050-0199 THE COMMISSION STRONGLY ENCOURAGES THESE EFFORTS TO IMPROVE PROTECTION ALONG A MOTORCADE ROUTE
LJ050-0200 THE SECRET SERVICE SHOULD UTILIZE THE PERSONNEL OF OTHER FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICES
LJ050-0201 IN THE LOCALITY TO ASSURE ADEQUATE MANPOWER FOR THIS TASK AS IT IS NOW DOING
LJ050-0202 LACK OF ADEQUATE RESOURCES IS AN UNACCEPTABLE EXCUSE FOR FAILING TO IMPROVE ADVANCE PRECAUTIONS
LJ050-0203 IN THIS CRUCIAL AREA OF PRESIDENTIAL PROTECTION
LJ050-0204 SECRET SERVICE PERSONNEL AND FACILITIES
LJ050-0205 TESTIMONY AND OTHER EVIDENCE BEFORE THE COMMISSION
LJ050-0206 SUGGEST THAT THE SECRET SERVICE IS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH ITS JOB WITH TOO FEW PEOPLE AND WITHOUT ADEQUATE MODERN EQUIPMENT
LJ050-0207 ALTHOUGH CHIEF ROWLEY DOES NOT COMPLAIN ABOUT THE PAY SCALE FOR SECRET SERVICE AGENTS
LJ050-0208 SALARIES ARE BELOW THOSE OF THE FBI AND LEADING MUNICIPAL POLICE FORCES
LJ050-0209 THE ASSISTANT TO THE DIRECTOR OF THE FBI TESTIFIED THAT
LJ050-0210 THE CASELOAD OF EACH FBI AGENT AVERAGED 20 TO 25 AND HE FELT THAT THIS WAS HIGH
LJ050-0211 CHIEF ROWLEY TESTIFIED THAT THE PRESENT WORKLOAD OF EACH SECRET SERVICE AGENT AVERAGES 110.1 CASES
LJ050-0212 WHILE THESE STATISTICS RELATE TO THE ACTIVITIES OF SECRET SERVICE AGENTS STATIONED IN FIELD OFFICES AND NOT THE WHITE HOUSE DETAIL
LJ050-0213 FIELD AGENTS SUPPLEMENT THOSE ON THE DETAIL PARTICULARLY WHEN THE PRESIDENT IS TRAVELING
LJ050-0214 ALTHOUGH THE COMMISSION DOES NOT KNOW WHETHER THE CASES INVOLVED ARE ENTIRELY COMPARABLE
LJ050-0215 THESE FIGURES SUGGEST THAT THE AGENTS OF THE SECRET SERVICE ARE SUBSTANTIALLY OVERWORKED
LJ050-0216 IN ITS BUDGET REQUEST FOR THE FISCAL YEAR BEGINNING JULY ONE NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR
LJ050-0217 THE SECRET SERVICE SOUGHT FUNDS FOR 25 NEW POSITIONS PRIMARILY IN FIELD OFFICES. THIS INCREASE HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE CONGRESS
LJ050-0218 CHIEF ROWLEY EXPLAINED THAT THIS WOULD NOT PROVIDE ENOUGH ADDITIONAL MANPOWER TO TAKE ALL THE MEASURES WHICH HE CONSIDERS REQUIRED
LJ050-0219 HOWEVER THE NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR TO 65 BUDGET REQUEST WAS SUBMITTED IN NOVEMBER NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
LJ050-0220 AND REQUESTS FOR ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL WERE NOT MADE BECAUSE OF THE STUDIES THEN BEING CONDUCTED
LJ050-0221 THE SECRET SERVICE HAS NOW PRESENTED ITS RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE BUREAU OF THE BUDGET. THE PLAN PROPOSED BY THE SERVICE
LJ050-0222 WOULD TAKE APPROXIMATELY 20 MONTHS TO IMPLEMENT AND REQUIRE EXPENDITURES OF APPROXIMATELY $3000000 DURING THAT PERIOD
LJ050-0223 THE PLAN PROVIDES FOR AN ADDITIONAL 205 AGENTS FOR THE SECRET SERVICE. SEVENTEEN OF THIS NUMBER ARE PROPOSED FOR THE PROTECTIVE RESEARCH SECTION
LJ050-0224 145 ARE PROPOSED FOR THE FIELD OFFICES TO HANDLE THE INCREASED VOLUME OF SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS
LJ050-0225 AND BE AVAILABLE TO PROTECT THE PRESIDENT OR VICE PRESIDENT WHEN THEY TRAVEL
LJ050-0226 18 AGENTS ARE PROPOSED FOR A ROTATING POOL WHICH WILL GO THROUGH AN INTENSIVE TRAINING CYCLE AND ALSO BE AVAILABLE TO SUPPLEMENT THE WHITE HOUSE DETAIL
LJ050-0227 IN CASE OF UNEXPECTED NEED AND 25 ADDITIONAL AGENTS ARE RECOMMENDED TO PROVIDE THE VICE PRESIDENT FULL PROTECTION
LJ050-0228 THE COMMISSION URGES THAT THE BUREAU OF THE BUDGET REVIEW THESE RECOMMENDATIONS WITH THE SECRET SERVICE AND AUTHORIZE A REQUEST FOR THE NECESSARY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATION
LJ050-0229 AS SOON AS IT CAN BE JUSTIFIED THE CONGRESS HAS OFTEN STRESSED THAT IT WILL SUPPORT ANY REASONABLE REQUEST FOR FUNDS FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE PRESIDENT
LJ050-0230 MANPOWER AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM OTHER AGENCIES
LJ050-0231 BEFORE THE ASSASSINATION THE SECRET SERVICE INFREQUENTLY REQUESTED OTHER FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO PROVIDE PERSONNEL
LJ050-0232 TO ASSIST IN ITS PROTECTION FUNCTIONS
LJ050-0233 SINCE THE ASSASSINATION THE SERVICE HAS EXPERIMENTED WITH THE USE OF AGENTS BORROWED FOR SHORT PERIODS FROM SUCH AGENCIES
LJ050-0234 IT HAS USED OTHER TREASURY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENTS ON SPECIAL EXPERIMENTS IN BUILDING AND ROUTE SURVEYS IN PLACES TO WHICH THE PRESIDENT FREQUENTLY TRAVELS
LJ050-0235 IT HAS ALSO USED OTHER FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENTS DURING PRESIDENTIAL VISITS TO CITIES IN WHICH SUCH AGENTS ARE STATIONED
LJ050-0236 THUS IN THE 4 MONTHS FOLLOWING THE ASSASSINATION
LJ050-0237 THE FBI ON SIXTY SEPARATE OCCASIONS SUPPLIED A TOTAL OF 139 AGENTS TO ASSIST IN PROTECTION WORK DURING A PRESIDENTIAL VISIT
LJ050-0238 WHICH REPRESENTS A DEPARTURE FROM ITS PRIOR PRACTICE
LJ050-0239 FROM FEBRUARY ELEVEN THROUGH JUNE 30 NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR
LJ050-0240 THE SERVICE HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF 9500 HOURS OF WORK BY OTHER ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES
LJ050-0241 THE FBI HAS INDICATED THAT IT IS WILLING TO CONTINUE TO MAKE SUCH ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE
LJ050-0242 EVEN THOUGH IT AGREES WITH THE SECRET SERVICE THAT IT IS PREFERABLE FOR THE SERVICE TO HAVE ENOUGH AGENTS TO HANDLE ALL PROTECTIVE DEMANDS
LJ050-0243 THE COMMISSION ENDORSES THESE EFFORTS TO SUPPLEMENT THE SERVICE'S OWN PERSONNEL BY OBTAINING FOR SHORT PERIODS OF TIME
LJ050-0244 THE ASSISTANCE OF TRAINED FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS
LJ050-0245 IN VIEW OF THE EVERINCREASING MOBILITY OF AMERICAN PRESIDENTS IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT THE SERVICE COULD OR SHOULD INCREASE ITS OWN STAFF TO A SIZE
LJ050-0246 WHICH WOULD PERMIT IT TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE PROTECTIVE MANPOWER FOR ALL SITUATIONS
LJ050-0247 THE COMMISSION RECOMMENDS THAT THE AGENCIES INVOLVED DETERMINE HOW MUCH PERIODIC ASSISTANCE THEY CAN PROVIDE AND THAT EACH SUCH AGENCY
LJ050-0248 AND THE SECRET SERVICE ENTER INTO A FORMAL AGREEMENT DEFINING SUCH ARRANGEMENTS
LJ050-0249 IT MAY EVENTUALLY BE DESIRABLE TO CODIFY THE PRACTICE IN AN EXECUTIVE ORDER
LJ050-0250 THE SECRET SERVICE WILL BE BETTER ABLE TO PLAN ITS OWN LONGRANGE PERSONNEL REQUIREMENTS IF IT KNOWS WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY
LJ050-0251 THE AMOUNT OF ASSISTANCE THAT IT CAN EXPECT FROM OTHER AGENCIES
LJ050-0252 THE OCCASIONAL USE OF PERSONNEL FROM OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES TO ASSIST IN PROTECTING THE PRESIDENT HAS A FURTHER ADVANTAGE. IT SYMBOLIZES THE REALITY
LJ050-0253 THAT THE JOB OF PROTECTING THE PRESIDENT HAS NOT BEEN AND CANNOT BE EXCLUSIVELY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE SECRET SERVICE
LJ050-0254 THE SECRET SERVICE IN THE PAST HAS SOMETIMES GUARDED ITS RIGHT TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE SOLE PROTECTOR OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE
LJ050-0255 THIS NO LONGER APPEARS TO BE THE CASE
LJ050-0256 PROTECTING THE PRESIDENT IS A DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX TASK WHICH REQUIRES FULL USE OF THE BEST RESOURCES OF MANY PARTS OF OUR GOVERNMENT
LJ050-0257 RECOGNITION THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY MUST BE SHARED INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT IT WILL BE MET
LJ050-0258 MUCH OF THE SECRET SERVICE WORK REQUIRES THE DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT
LJ050-0259 SOME OF WHICH MUST BE SPECIALLY DESIGNED TO FIT UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS. EVEN BEFORE THE ASSASSINATION AND TO A FAR GREATER EXTENT THEREAFTER
LJ050-0260 THE SECRET SERVICE HAS BEEN RECEIVING FULL COOPERATION IN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT
LJ050-0261 FROM MANY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES INCLUDING THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
LJ050-0262 EVEN IF THE MANPOWER AND TECHNOLOGICAL RESOURCES OF THE SECRET SERVICE ARE ADEQUATELY AUGMENTED
LJ050-0263 IT WILL CONTINUE TO RELY IN MANY RESPECTS UPON THE GREATER RESOURCES OF THE OFFICE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER AGENCIES
LJ050-0264 THE COMMISSION RECOMMENDS THAT THE PRESENT ARRANGEMENTS
LJ050-0265 WITH THE OFFICE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AND THE OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES THAT HAVE BEEN SO HELPFUL TO THE SECRET SERVICE BE PLACED ON A PERMANENT AND FORMAL BASIS
LJ050-0266 THE EXCHANGE OF LETTERS DATED AUGUST THIRTY ONE NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR
LJ050-0267 BETWEEN SECRETARY DILLON AND DONALD F. HORNIG SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY IS A USEFUL EFFORT IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION
LJ050-0268 THE SERVICE SHOULD NEGOTIATE A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH EACH AGENCY THAT HAS BEEN ASSISTING IT AND FROM WHICH IT CAN EXPECT TO NEED HELP IN THE FUTURE
LJ050-0269 THE ESSENTIAL TERMS OF SUCH MEMORANDA MIGHT WELL BE EMBODIED IN AN EXECUTIVE ORDER
LJ050-0270 THIS COMMISSION CAN RECOMMEND NO PROCEDURES FOR THE FUTURE PROTECTION OF OUR PRESIDENTS WHICH WILL GUARANTEE SECURITY
LJ050-0271 THE DEMANDS ON THE PRESIDENT IN THE EXECUTION OF HIS RESPONSIBILITIES IN TODAY'S WORLD ARE SO VARIED AND COMPLEX
LJ050-0272 AND THE TRADITIONS OF THE OFFICE IN A DEMOCRACY SUCH AS OURS ARE SO DEEPSEATED AS TO PRECLUDE ABSOLUTE SECURITY
LJ050-0273 THE COMMISSION HAS HOWEVER FROM ITS EXAMINATION OF THE FACTS OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S ASSASSINATION
LJ050-0274 MADE CERTAIN RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH IT BELIEVES WOULD IF ADOPTED
LJ050-0275 MATERIALLY IMPROVE UPON THE PROCEDURES IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S ASSASSINATION AND RESULT IN A SUBSTANTIAL LESSENING OF THE DANGER
LJ050-0276 AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT THE COMMISSION HAS NOT RESOLVED ALL THE PROPOSALS WHICH COULD BE MADE THE COMMISSION NEVERTHELESS IS CONFIDENT THAT
LJ050-0277 WITH THE ACTIVE COOPERATION OF THE RESPONSIBLE AGENCIES AND WITH THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES IN THEIR DEMANDS UPON THEIR PRESIDENT
LJ050-0278 THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE HAVE HERE SUGGESTED WOULD GREATLY ADVANCE THE SECURITY OF THE OFFICE WITHOUT ANY IMPAIRMENT OF OUR FUNDAMENTAL LIBERTIES
